<p>Hey Whizy,</p>

<p>I am Sherry, contacting you from <a href="https://www.couponbirds.com/research?utm_source=mail&utm_campaign=se03">CouponBirds Research</a>.</p>

<p>I came across your article <em>"Going shopping" is dead How stores sucked the fun out of an American pastime</em> published on <b>08/22/2023</b>, and I echo your comments on "Dwell time understandably hinges on how pleasant the store experience is." Our team analyzed 190,000+ user feedback on coupon extensions from Chrome Web Store and found:
<ul>
    <li>User ratings have experienced a slight decline over the years, dropping from <b>4.9</b> stars in 2018 to <b>4.7</b> stars in 2024.</li>
    <li>There has been an increase in the percentage of negative reviews, growing from <b>1.2%</b> in 2018 to <b>8%</b> in 2024.</li>
    <li>Consumer expectations are rising as the share of negative reviews has risen from about <b>20%</b> in 2018 to <b>40%</b> in 2024 among comments about pop-ups.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>Here is the link to our study and infographic: <a href="https://www.couponbirds.com/research/coupon-extensions-save-money">Saving Money: The Continued Benefits of Coupons in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe Vox's readers will like to see them as well, inform me and I will provide raw data and high-resolution infographics upon request. </p>
