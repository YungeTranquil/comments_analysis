Very nice carrier. It claims for animals up to ""16 lbs"". My cat weighs 15 lbs and I was worried but there is ample room for her to ride, be carried and move around. Several zip options allowing you to place your pet in through the top, either side or in the front. Lightweight but sturdy. Not a lot of ""structure"" but it's soft sided so it won't easily stand up on it's own. Two durable handles for carrying and a snap on shoulder strap. To me, it's perfect to take my cat to the vet or the groomers and priced very reasonably as well as being offered in a variety of colors. I have not used it for travel but it claims that it is qualified for travel and I see no issues if you attempted to use it for that. Also comes with a fleece bottom for comfort and can be removed for washing. Really a truly efficient, reasonably priced, sturdy carrier, IMO.

I recently purchased this carrier for my dog, and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations. Designed with both convenience and durability in mind, this travel carrier is an absolute game-changer for pet owners on the go.First and foremost, let's talk about sturdiness. This travel carrier is built to last. Constructed from high-quality materials, it provides a safe and secure environment for your furry friend during travel. Whether you're commuting to the vet or embarking on a cross-country adventure, you can trust that your pet is snug and protected inside this robust carrier.One of the standout features of this carrier is its multiple zippered openings. These thoughtful additions make it incredibly easy to access your pet and attend to their needs during travel. Whether you need to give them a treat, a quick petting session, or simply check on their well-being, you can do so with ease, thanks to the strategically placed zippers.Moreover, the hard bottom of the case adds an extra layer of rigidity, ensuring that the carrier maintains its shape even in the face of bumps and jostles during travel. This feature not only provides added stability but also enhances the overall comfort of your pet, giving them a sturdy surface to rest on throughout the journey.In addition to its practical features, this travel carrier also boasts a sleek and stylish design. Available in a variety of colors, it allows you to travel in style while keeping your pet safe and comfortable.Overall, I couldn't be more impressed with the carrier. Its sturdiness, multiple zippered openings, and hard bottom for extra rigidity make it a must-have for any pet owner on the move. Whether you're running errands around town or embarking on a grand adventure, this travel carrier has you covered. Highly recommended!

This is overall a great product and I hope my kitten will not grow too big and outgrow it (bought size med)! I work in the veterinary industry and having this many little openings in a cat carrier is wonderful. It is easy to pack away, but sturdy when using.I only docked one star because I have to wonder if I received a previously returned item. When I unpacked it, my kitten was sniffing more than she normally would, and on closer inspection, I noticed a few little black hairs on the white fabric piece inside. My cat is orange and white, and our dog is tan and white - so the hair didn't come from our household. I attached a photo, not sure how well it shows. Everything else seems brand new, so I don't mind, but might be something to know before buying! Would still recommend purchasing!

I love this carrier!
Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023Size: 17.0""L x 11.0""W x 11.0""HColor: PinkVerified Purchase
I purchased two of these before for my two cats & they are just perfect in every way. We've unexpectedly adopted another cat, and I've just gotten this one for her.I like that there are so many zippers. Great choices for loading the cat in the bag & removing it once at the vet. The smaller and larger side doors so the cat can enter or exit independently are very nice. The bottom features a removable wooden base that's got a zippered faux fur cover & foam pad. I've removed & washed it & it washes very nicely (Including the foam). There's a handy pocket to store paperwork or for bringing home supplies/receipts from the vet.It has carry handles that you can Velcro together if you choose. It also has an adjustable shoulder strap for ease of carrying your pet, or when your hands are full.  One feature I really like is that the back side & half of one of the sides is covered with fabric. It's handy when there are a lot of other animals at the vet so I can turn the carrier so my cats can't see & be frightened by other animals. The remaining side, half side, top & front are screened for good ventilation & to allow your pet to look out if they chose.Though I haven't had the chance to use it, there's a large, handy loop that allows you to slip the carrier over a rolling suitcase handle, in the event you're traveling with your pet. The carrier is airline approved for travel, should you want to take your pet along.There's a great variety of colors to choose from, and it comes in a larger size if you have a bigger pet or want to carry multiple small pets in a single carrier. The medium is plenty large for a cat  up to 15-20 lbs. I'd think a dog of that size would be comfortable as well, or you can go with the larger size, which is plenty big. I purchased the large size initially & thought it was too large for a cat, so I returned it and got the medium-sized one.It's reasonably priced, yet very well-made. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a high quality carrier for a good price.Thanks Henkelion. I'm very pleased with your carrier. It's a great product. I'm in the market for thick, heavy, high quality double-sided stitched breakaway leather collars for my cats, if that's something you might carry in the future. Nylon & fabric collars just don't hold up with cats' sharp claws scratching at them & I've been unable to find high quality collars, like those made for dogs, but with a breakaway (not elastic) feature.  Please advise if you do begin carrying something like that. (Must be breakaway for cats.) Thanks again for a great product.

Love it and want in a couple more colors!!
Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2021Size: XX-LargeColor: Hot PinkVerified Purchase
My favorite jacket ever! This pullover is made with the best details. The fabric it’s made with is smooth, light weight, durable and not overly hot. It’s zippers, cinching cord at the bottom, wrist elastic, and even the zipper pulls are of exceptional quality. All of the seams, and stitching is excellent. There are no loose threads or mis- stitchings. The fit is generous and comfy.  I tried going down a size to see if it fit better, but it was going to be too uncomfortable around the hips. I am not one to wear something I have to pull on all day. The sleeves were a little bit long, but I usually roll up once on all of my jackets. The upper arms are perfect, not too loose or snug. The chest and waist are good and loose, hips are perfect and the length is just covering my butt. 5’5, size 16/18 and I bought XXL. The XL, fit and went over my hips, but if I wanted to wear a heavier shirt under it… no.The pink color is the one I got, but I would love one in every color. The colors are vibrant and when it’s raining, the bright color is pleasant addition!

Pretty good, but a bit small
Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023Size: X-LargeColor: NavyVerified Purchase
I normally purchase my outdoor gear from LL Bean or Bass Pro, so using Amazon for this kind of thing is a first for me. Seems all the major companies are buying from outside the US, so I figured I might as well try this one. It's made int the United Arab Emirates...go figure.Anyhow, about the product. The fit is a bit smaller than what I would have liked. In the photos I'm wearing a Tee and a merino wool top. I was hoping to be able to layer under this, but...it's all good. I could maybe wear a thin coat and not be too uncomfortable.Based on my first wear in a light rain, it keeps the water off (way better than the Bean version) and it's packable(like the Bean version). It has air holes under the arms so you don't get too hot. It's comfortable, but a little noisey for still hunting(if you're into that, I'm still gonna give it a go).Only thing I can complain about is the pockets seem to open a bit of their own accord and they get a little water running into them. Kind of a bummer, but I've dealt with worse.I would buy this product again, but I get a bigger size.Edit 19 May 2023Did a test the other day. We had a good Midwestern storm come through, heavy rain and some winds. I stood in the rain until my pants were pretty wet. When I went back in the house and took the anorak off, my shirt was completely dry. Loving this anorak a bit more now.

I saw a friend wearing this jacket and immediately wanted the same color. I’m 5 7and 130 pounds so I bought the medium. I love the pink against the olive green. I have not worn it in a torrential rain, but it worked well during a horseback ride with a wet, consistent drizzle.  He is very lightweight so it is a good spring summer fall jacket. I have worn it with a sweatshirt under during colder weather.  Zippers, material, and everything looks quality and I’ve had no problems with it. After several washes it still looks the same.  I really like it.

The gentle pressure and soothing scent create the perfect environment for relaxation and restful sleep. However, it’s worth noting that the fragrance tends to dissipate after about 5 or 6 nights of use. To prolong the aromatic experience, I recommend investing in a bottle of lavender essential oils and applying a small amount to the edges of the mask before bedtime.

Absolutely love this sleep mask. The block out is amazing and it's comfortable to sleep with. The only issue I have is with the nose piece being of a different material which sometimes makes me sweat around my nose (but I am extremely sensitive to any temperature changes so that's most likely the cause of it).

I am a Flight Attendant and have been using what I thought was a fairly good mask but would slip a little as I sleep allowing light to come in, this mask fits tightly and does not move!  That being said it is tight almost too tight! I wish the strap was just a little longer as the pressure on my eyes is sometimes too much and my eyes hurt I am working out how to make the strap longer without adding bulk in the back of my head which is also uncomfortable.  I wear it every night and bought 2 one for home one for work.  It truly blacks out the light, I love it!

Works exactly how I need it to work.
Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2022Verified Purchase
Hands down, the best sleep mask I’ve bought so far. I am a very picky person when it comes to these things and it fits very comfortably but, most importantly, it actually blocks 100% of the light unlike other masks that advertise the same. There’s nothing more annoying that that tiny sliver of light leaking in through bridge of the nose and I’m glad this one actually delivers on its promise. It’s also very soft and comfortable and there is plenty of space to blink without your lashes touching the mask. 10/10 would recommend.

With the size difference between the 21-inch carry-on model and the 28-inch checked baggage size, there is of course no problem with putting the smaller one inside the 28-inch.Unfortunately the 21-inch, like all carry-on luggage, really only holds enough for a couple of days by itself. So I wanted to get the 24-inch middle size. Anything larger than 21 inches will need to be checked, in case anyone is still not sure about that. Some airlines will even complain if your 21-inch case is expanded and can't fit easily in the provided metal frame baggage size tester you see at a lot of gates or check-in counters. So be careful about leaving the 21-inch size expanded when you're actually trying to use it as a carry-on.I was hesitant to order the 24-inch because I wasn't certain that it would successfully nest inside the 28-inch model. I could find no information on this in the answered questions or anywhere in online reviews of these exact ""Freeform"" luggage models. The dimensional difference between the 24 and 28-inch models isn't nearly as much as between the 21 and 28-inch models.This is potentially very important if you either A) live in a very small place to begin with, or B) wind up in a very cramped hotel room (or even just one with a really awkward layout) where they don't provide a decent spot to store both a 24-inch and a 28-inch luggage case separately without one of them really being in the way. Closets are typically just big enough to store one or the other size, but probably not both if you can't nest them first. Trying to stack them vertically will typically just use up all available space for hanging outerwear in an already tiny hotel closet.I took a chance and ordered it anyway, without knowing the answer. The news is mostly good. I found that the 21-inch fits easily within the 24-inch. So that was a very good start. But the 28-inch won't quite close with the 24-inch inside. Not nearly as easily as when I fit the 21-inch into the 24-inch. Seems like the 24-inch is a bit too thick. Luckily, all three models have an expansion zipper around the middle. Once the largest case is expanded, the main zipper will successfully close all the way around with the 24-inch inside.So, technically, you can nest all three together, 21/24/28, as a set. You just have to expand the 28-inch case first. The complete set of three cases will then take up a couple of inches more room than expected in the front-side to back-side dimension wherever you decide to store it. I don't think I would recommend trying to compress it to re-close the expansion zipper and then leave it that way in long term storage. Probably not a good idea.As for a review of the cases themselves, they have been pretty sturdy so far, and they are pretty lightweight without really feeling flimsy at all. The double wheels on each corner provide more stability and ability to roll over slightly rough surfaces like tiled walkways, moderate carpeting and asphalt, compared to spinner cases that only put a single inline-skate type wheel on each corner. I really dislike those. And of course they are all spinners, which is a far superior arrangement to tilt-and-roll types of luggage. You can actually put quite a large bag (like a ~30LB backpack) on top of any of these sizes and still roll the whole thing around on its four wheels without too much trouble. The larger sizes will be more stable, but even the 21-inch isn't too bad.Put two of these spinners back to back and it's not too difficult to hold the extended handles together with one hand and angle the two so that you can use your knee behind the larger one to get it going, and then push the smaller one along in front of the bigger one. Once they start moving it works out pretty well.The sides are plastic and tend to develop a lot of static when the humidity is low. So you may wind up with a lot of dust/hair all over them if you lay them down on a carpet before a thorough vacuuming. Rubbing the outside with a dryer sheet may help with this.Some colors seem to have a glossy finish. The navy blue and others have a sort of tiny diamond-shaped matte texture except in the grooves. They will all get scratched as soon as they go through even a single airport baggage system. It may be less obvious on the lighter colors. But the really light colors will show the black marks from luggage belts much more easily. Just remember that they are hard sided, so no outer pockets or fabric on front/back to get torn up easily like soft-sided luggage, and they have expansion zippers, which a lot of hard-sided luggage don't include. So just pick the color you like and try not to worry about it. And they do go on sale now and then. I was able to get the first set of 21/28 for under two hundred. I think they are kind of overpriced most of the time.

Great for 4-week carry-on only trip
Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2023Size: Carry-On 21-InchColor: Sage GreenVerified Purchase
I was planning a 4-week trip to Scotland and needed a case that fit the airline specs, but held as much as possible. I tried out a lot of different carry-ons and decided on this one. The things I looked at were packing volume, weight, handle sturdiness and operation, and extra features. I spent time testing how they maneuvered when packed with a heavy load and had a heavy backpack on top. (The weight can make a real difference.)Being expandable was a requirement. This is because you usually wear some of your bulkiest shoes and outerwear, etc., to create more room in the case. Then, once in country, it's possible to expand the luggage to pack those items when traveling town to town. You can also buy some things like toothpaste, hair spray, etc., to use while in country, and then discard before flying home. That can require the carry-on to expand, as well.The carry-on is fairly light weight and has good volume for packing as much as possible. It has a side handle, as well as a top handle. That really helps me lift it up to place on a rack. The placement of the zip divider panel was better than in some of the other bags. Some of the other carry-ons I evaluated had the zip panel sewn in pretty far down below the zipper edge of the case. This really reduced the depth that is available for packing on that side. This case did a better job with that.One thing that was really important to me was the maneuverability when the case was carrying a heavy load.  This piece was the best. I can place a heavy backpack on top, and still whip around with ease on hard floors through the airport. I've taken it on trains and through train stations, as well. It's great.On the other reviews, I did note that people said this case showed scratches easily. Because I was going to a wet climate, I also ordered a clear plastic cover for the case. It worked in the rain, and also protected the case. It had to be checked on one occasion and was frequently loaded into the base of a bus. It still looks really good after 4 weeks of travel.One thing that Samsonite could improve on is the direction that the zippered panel opens when unzipped. You have to lay the panel over the other side of the case when it's open. It would be better if it opened to the outside so that the contents of the other side of the case was visible when the the panel is open.All and all, I am very happy with my choice. It worked well for a 4-week carry-on only trip.  The color is beautiful, as well.

This is a great suitcase that not only looks nice, is durable and has 4 excellent spinner wheels.  I used this bags for a 2 week Europe trip along with a tote.  I was able to carry it on.  One has to be mindful of weight when flying domestic in Europe even though the size works well.  I was .2 kilos over the weight in Frankfurt and had to check the bag.It is easy to manuever and this bag has helped a nortorious overpacker to pack lighter and better and the bag also looks quite smart.

Withstood 7 airports and a cruise line. Of course it got some scrapes, but the wheels, handle and lock worked without fail. Lock was easy to set. Love the spinner wheels. It was so easy to push even over bumpy surfaces. The purple color made it easy to find on the carousel especially when paired with a bright different color luggage tag. It expands which makes it feel more flimsy to open and close, but had no difficulties with it when expanded. Holds a lot and felt confident that any breakables would be safe!.

Very clear image, accurate free AI and preventing almost all false alerts
Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2024
I bought this bird feeder as a replacement for my previous one which did not include free AI bird detection and hence without that it was almost impossible to have an easy overview of the animals which are visiting the bird feeder. That's much better here so I would say free AI is definitely a must for me in the future because it saves me so much time to find everything I want in very short time. I also don't need to see my own face in the alerts list when I've been filling up the bird feeder with peanuts of bird food or sugar water for the hummingbirds.The bird feeder came with everything even including extra mounts, screws, tools - very generous. All the parts look solid built and were easy to assemble even without the instructions manual and also connecting the camera to the app was self-explaining just after opening the app. Wireless range seems to be good and allows even for live viewing in good quality. Also the recorded clips are in very good quality. Especially the close-ups (see pics) are impressive. I can see even the smallest details like single hair and the footage is not over compressed, white balance is always on point.  Best footage of any bird feeder I've already had by far.I'm not using it in a very sunny location but the solar panel is efficient enough to still charger the battery every day back to 100% easily. I'm also impressed about how the manufacturer is supporting this bird feeder camera because there has already been another firmware update with more improvements.Great experience so far.

Excellent  value
Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2023Size: 100mmVerified Purchase
Overall very happy with purchase.  Note that the balls each weigh 2.25 lbs so they are more than the tournament weight of 2 lbs.  And size at 100 mm is slightly less than tournament measure of 107.  That said if use these and then want a tournament set to play adjustment easier than going from smaller lighter weight balls.  Had to leave durability out as have not used enough to tell.  But with Amazon basics there is a one year warranty which is enough time to tell how durable.  I have only given 4 stars because the bag is rather flimsy and no inside dividers to keep balls apart and cardboard between the top and bottom is not strong enough to easily put the balls in using that.  Stronger separation and egg shell divider would be an improvement.  I made one  from flaps on a box of K cups but any durable cardboard will work. But recently I ordered plastic dividers to surround outside edge and separate internally.  If do not mind spending bit for dividers might find this useful. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08PQ8Z5T5/  Have added pix of mine using cardboard above.  But this does give so plastic or wood probably better for divider.  If use cardboard you can slit part way for the pieces to fit and trim to right size.  Not difficult and protects the balls and makes the carrying case more sturdy and useful.  All of that said for the price this is excellent value.  More for adults or children in their teens because of size and weight.

Fantastic value

Seems wonderful, surprising heft and quality for the rock bottom price. We've been careful to avoid striking rocks or concrete, we've had it out for perhaps 8 games in the yard and have had only some clinking between the balls themselves. But they're holding up well, no chipping or major scratches. Everyone has had a great time, heft feels just right.

I love love love this bag!!!!!!! It feels so well made, it’s heavy duty but not too heavy weight wise. When we go out to the park or anything or travel to the beach this bag carries all of our stuff for ourselves, baby, and dog. Of course the material is the best too because if it gets dirty we just throw it in the shower to rinse it off and let it dry in there! It comes with two little bags that clip inside or outside, you just push the tabs through the holes for phones or small stuff you wouldn’t want to get lost in the main compartment. I know $90 seems like a bit much for such a simple bag but it’s 100% worth it!

Best Entry-level Home Espresso Machine
Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2018Color: Brushed Stainless SteelVerified Purchase
I absolutely love this machine. With as many lattes as I drink, this will easily pay for itself within a year, inclouding the cost of beans, milk and cleaning products.Notes: Make sure to keep up with all the regular maintenance.  Ever day after I've made my coffee, I wipe the steam wand, purge it, then wipe again. Make sure to get into all the crevices around the tip and you'll never need to use the pin to clean out the tip. Once I've done that and poured my steamed milk, I purge the showerhead by pulling one shot into the empty mug (no filters). This keeps the showerhead clean of coffee debris and keeps the coffee tasting pure.REMEMBER TO CHANGE YOUR WATER FILTERS. The filters should be changed every 60 uses or 2 months, whichever comes first. This wolill reduce how often you need to descale the machine, prolong it's useful life and provide better tasting coffees. You will still need to descale the machine every so often. The manual included is very helpful for keeping up with the maintenance (as well as pulling shots, making drinks and other useful tips) and you can also find instructions on their website should you misplace the manual. Gold tone makes pretty inexpensive replacement filters specific to this machine and they're available here on Amazon. I use them and am pretty happy with the results.Do not let the water run out. Ever. This could cause serious damage to the machine. If you forget once or twice, you'll probably be just fine but check the water reservoir at least 1-2 times per week.Clean the machine parts at least once a week. You may need to empty and rinse the drip tray 1-2 times a week (depending on frequency of use) but take it out and hand wash at least once a week. This is a good time to wash the tools and tool bin as well. Also, dont forget to take the coffee filters out of the portafilter and wash those as well. Over time, residue can build up underneath there. Also, the spouts in the portafiler twist off so you can clean them better. Clean out your parts, get in those crevices regularly and you'll be just fine.Don't forget to clean the hopper and grinder. You should clean it out every time you switch to a new bean or at least every few pounds of coffee. The instructions in the manual are pretty easy and straight forward. I also use a clean, dry towel to wipe any remaining coffee and oils from both the grinder parts and the hopper. Do not wash in warm water as you could risk it not drying well and rusting or not being lubricated enough and over heating. Just use the included brush and clean, dry paper towels. You could also vacuum out residual coffee from the grinder to assist in cleaning, but I don't usually need to.Also, remember that the stainless exterior is stainless plating. This means it can wear over time and not look as nice. The best way to handle this is to wipe it down with a damp cloth (once daily then more detailed once a week) and follow it up by drying it with a clean towel. This will prolong the exterior appearance. Also during your weekly cleaning, be sure to look under where the coffee and steam come out and clean around there. Milk, coffee and residue steam can splatter and build up so be sure to clean it as well.The weekly cleaning sound intensive but really takes maybe 5 minutes.Common issues: Keep in mind certain o-rings will need to be replaced over time. This is noted by Breville in the manual and on the website. There are two main places where you need to replace these: around the tip of the portafilter (where the spouts connect) and where the portafilter connects to pull shots.Another common issue is that the machine will make a loud ""buzzing"" sound and/or leak water out of the bottom of the machine. This is a common issue and, when it does occur, usually happens around 6 months to a year. This generally occurs due to a broken solenoid valve. If your product is still under warranty, take a video and contact their customer service. Maybe suggest it's a solenoid valve and they are usually very good about fixing or replacing the machines and parts. If it is no longer under warranty and they will not resolve the issue (because sometimes they still will after the warranty period), there are many repair services that can fix this. If you are especially handy and brave enough to fix it yourself, you can usually find the replacement parts fairly cheaply online (not just the valve, but really ANY part that may need to be replaced). Again, if it's still under warranty do not go this route, as it will void any existing warranty. Also, if you don't know what you're doing, you could do more damage than good.All-in-all, this is an amazing machine for this price point. There is a reason this machine is so popular and highly rated. There's a lot of customization available to you and it is a very good quality machine. I would not suggest any product below this machine and price point for your first machine as you'll likely be very disappointed in the results.  Eventually you may want to upgrade to a more robust multi-thousand dollar machine, but this is great for the majority of consumers and is super user friendly. Use higher quality beans directly from the roasters and learn how to use the machine and make drinks and you'll be very happy with it. The quality is truly amazing for such a low cost espresso machine.Side note: Whole Latte Love on YouTube is a great resource for additional reviews, tips and tricks and maintenance for this machine (and many more). It's also a great resource on how to pull shots, steam milk, pick types of milk and make many different types of drinks when you're just starting out or want to up your coffee game.

BUY THIS MACHINE, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY...
Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2015Color: Brushed Stainless SteelVerified Purchase
I rarely write online reviews of products I buy, but I am so impressed by this machine I must share with people who are contemplating this purchase.BOTTOM LINE:This is an extremely good value for the price, and I would HIGHLY recommend this machine to anyone regardless of their experience level with making espresso-based beverages.  Read on for more detail...BACKGROUND:I am very careful when buying products in this kind of price range, and thus do a lot of research before buying.  This is especially true with something you can't truly ""try before you buy"".  I read over 100 of the reviews on this product, and although there are some complaints the major theme is very positive.  I have been using the Breville daily now for almost two months and feel I understand it's pro's and con's very well.As a coffee person, my focus is on espresso, Americano, and lattes.  I was never a drip-coffee person, but I have been a hardcore Starbucks latte guy for 6 years.  I have talked at length to baristas over the years to get a more technical understanding of what makes great coffee, and previously owned a fully automatic machine from Saeco (about a $600 machine).  When it came time to buy a new machine, I felt that I was ready to make the jump to a semi-automatic machine.Lastly, I come from a technology background (e.g. Apple employee) and feel that I am a good judge of design, manufacturing, user interface, etc.DESIGN:This is an extremely well designed product.  Every little detail, from the exterior & interior packaging to the controls on the front of the machine, is very thoughtfully done, well executed, and serves its intended purpose.  From the beginning you see that it is a high quality product, and Breville spent money where it matters.  The materials are visually appealing as well as sturdily built, with the kind of craftsmanship and heft you would expect from a much higher priced machine.  Nice touches like having the tamper store in a magnetized hole in the top of the machine, having the top surface of the machine stay warm from the boiler to keep your portafilter and coffee cup warm, and creating a hidden accessories tray in the base of the machine are signs of top notch designers.  Overall, the product is relatively compact and will fit into any size kitchen situation.  Lastly, the user instructions are extremely well done and very helpful - READ THEM.PERFORMANCE:The espresso produced is extremely consistent, and only changes as your beans age (although a pretty small difference).  The water boiler heats up very quickly and you will be drawing a shot less than 2 minutes after hitting the power button (part of this time is grinding the beans). The controls are easy to use, and the movable items such as the portafilter and steamer wand are holding up well and I have zero concern about long term reliability.  The steamer wand, compared to my previous Saeco, seems to create much richer milk foam, which is important for lattes and cappuccinos.  There are a number of ""complaints"" from people on these reviews about how difficult it is to get good espresso, but I can tell you my very first shot was good and has been ever since.  I think these people are creating the wrong impression, as this machine is incredibly easy to use.  However, it's critically important that you read the instruction manuals FIRST to help ensure you get it right.  The grind level is the only thing you really need to set, and that will be personal preference to some extent but for my beans it seems best at 4.  The other thing you control is how hard to tamp the grounds in the portafilter, and I will tell you that if you give it a good strong press (I use two hands on a hard flat surface), it will be just fine.  Don't overthink this machine!BEANS:I strongly suggest you find a local shop that roasts their beans on-site so you can have truly fresh beans.  You want espresso whole beans, and they need to be 100% Arabic and NOT the ""oily"" kind.  Otherwise, you will gum up your grinder.CLEANING:Terrific design makes this a breeze to clean.  The water and grounds catch tray just lifts out in one piece, and you can take everything to the sink without making a mess.  A quick rinse and you are ready to put it back.  One thing that cannot be avoided is that some of the coffee grinds will spill out of the portafilter during the grinding process, and may even fall off the coffee maker and onto the counter (or floor).  I shake the portafilter mildly while its grinding to even out the grounds to minimize the mess, but even that doesn't eliminate it completely.  The other mess creator is tamping the grounds and levelling off the dose size, this will cause grounds to be spilled.  Up to you how to contain this, although I just turn the dosing blade upside down and use it to scrape the grounds off my counter and into a bowl I use to catch the grounds when I level the dose. Overall it is quite minor and requires less than 5 minutes of clean-up a day.

Amazing!!
Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2024Color: CharcoalVerified Purchase
I purchased a set of Cadence travel containers for my upcoming trips and am absolutely thrilled with my purchase. The containers are incredibly versatile, allowing me to effortlessly store various toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner, lotion, facial cleanser, and exfoliator. The quality of these containers is top-notch, and they are absolutely leak-proof, making them perfect for both local weekend getaways and extended international travels.The containers hold a fair amount of product without taking up too much space in my luggage. The extenders provide flexibility in the amount of product I can bring, which I love!! The magnetic feature keeps the containers together in my toiletry bag and at my destination. The labels are clean and neat. They add an extra level of organization and ease to my routine away from home.I highly recommend Cadence travel containers to anyone looking for a reliable, high-quality solution to organize and transport their toiletries while on the go. They have exceeded my expectations and have become an essential part of my travel routine.

Not super impressive for the steep price tag
Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2024Color: CharcoalVerified Purchase
so I LOVE containers. I've seen these before when looking for travel containers, but was not about to spend $100+ dollars for the full set.But, I just got a new job that requires a heavy amount of traveling, so i thought, it's time to try these.I just ordered them. They came super fast, and I'm pretty disappointed. They don't look as 'clean or chic' as the ads look. The magnets are pretty weak. They stick together when standing, but you can't pick one up without the other falling off, and that's when they're empty. I expected them to STICK. I also can take or leave the permanent labeling on the top.I'm open to being surprised though as I haven't used them. I plan to fly next week and will update my rating if it warrants it, but honestly, they aren't >100$ impressive as far as I can tell. I also got 10$ 4-piece silicone set, and I'm way happier with those.

Useless and expensive
Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2024Color: PetalVerified Purchase
The concept of these jars is a great idea for purposes of conserving space and keeping all your toiletry travel containers together. However, they are so small that they barely hold enough in a large container for two days worth of and shampoo or conditioner. They are very expensive and are not leakproof.  The magnet also isn’t very strong. I saw these on Instagram and thought I just needed to buy them. I wish I had not. There are other travel toiletry containers that actually hold a decent amount of product that are a 10th of the price.

Honestly I was a little skeptical about the quality of the product for the price but I’m super happy I got this. I used them for my recent holiday travel and they fit so nicely in my bag and there were NO spills / leaks (which I can’t say the same for any of the cheaper grocery store travel containers I’ve tried). The capsules being magnetic and having cute little labels are also a really nice touch. 10/10 would recommend.

Perfect Camera for Content Creators!
Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2024Verified Purchase
I am absolutely in love with my Sony ZV-1 Digital Camera! As a content creator and vlogger, this camera has become an indispensable tool for capturing high-quality videos and photos. The image and video quality is outstanding, with crisp details and vibrant colors that make my content pop.One of the standout features of this camera is the flip screen, which makes it incredibly easy to frame shots and capture perfect selfies or vlog footage. The touchscreen display is intuitive and responsive, adding to the overall user experience.I also appreciate the built-in microphone, which delivers clear and crisp audio, eliminating the need for external microphones in most situations. The defocus setting is another favorite of mine, allowing me to achieve beautiful background blur and professional-looking shots effortlessly.My only minor gripe is that it would have been nice if the camera came with a battery charger instead of just a USB cable for charging. However, this is a small inconvenience compared to the overall quality and performance of the camera.In summary, the Sony ZV-1 Digital Camera is a game-changer for content creators, vloggers, and YouTubers. It delivers exceptional quality, ease of use, and versatility, making it a must-have tool for anyone serious about creating top-notch content. Highly recommended!

Fantastic option to create family memories, vlogging is ok in most situations
Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2020Verified Purchase
Let me start out by saying that I've used dozens of cameras over the past few years as a bit of a gear head.  I've had full frame DSLRs, full frame mirrorless, APS-C options, micro 4/3's, etc.  Most recently I had the Fuji X100V.  Having a growing family I realized that while I love taking pictures of my kids growing up, what really captures the interest of everyone is capturing videos.  I could take 1,000 pictures from a family trip and the things that the family will want to see is the video, not the pictures.  For this I realized that having a more compelling video option was needed.  In addition having a 7 year old girl, she's starting to want to make her own videos, which I post to her private YT channel.Pros- Having a compact option with a decently fast lens.  The lens could be wider, it could be longer.  There's a lot of could haves.  Why not ask for a 12-500 mm lens?  For what it is, it's a good compromise, has a decent enough range and fast lens, which is needed for a 1"" sensor.  The 24-200 would've been too slow to shoot indoors without an external light.- The front flip screen.  It makes talking head videos easier to shoot, putting it on a tripod and still having a hot/cold shoe for an external mic or a light source is fantastic.- Button layout.  Having a record button, having a tally light are great.Cons- I would've loved to see a better use of a touch screen interface.  Canon has it right for the most part, Sony could be much better.- I would've loved to have a mode dial and/or more front dials.  But given a choice between what we have in the ZV-1 or a larger body/more expensive model, I'm ok with what we have.Things to noteNo, the stabilization is not the best.  On standard it's not great.  On active it's better but crops in.  This is why I say for certain types of vlogging, like on a tripod or talking head video it's fine.  If you're expecting to walk around and talk to yourself, you'll want to invest in a gimbal.  No, the battery isn't the best.  Luckily they're tiny and you can find plenty of generic options.  No, you don't get a charger in the box.  Most cameras these days are not shipping with one.  No you won't get the ultra thin depth of field from this, it's a 1"" sensor, there are limitations.For the price, the size, the features, it's the best option that I've found at the present time.  It's not perfect, but any camera enthusiast will tell you that there isn't.  It's about weighing the positives and the negatives and find the one with the most plusses and the least amount of negatives for your needs.  Think about it, if the perfect camera existed, you'd have no compelling reason to upgrade to the next model, so in a way you have to think that manufacturers intentionally withhold a little here and a little there.

Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2024Color: CreamSize: 12 PieceVerified Purchase
We love the look and functionality of our Carote pans! They look stylish and cook the food well. The nonstick properties are excellent. I just have a couple complaints that prevent me from giving 5 stars.The major issue is that within only a couple uses, a couple of the pans started showing signs of wear despite following the care instructions. The smallest pan had stains on the handle and black spots show up on the bottom after only 2 uses, and the largest pan got a scratch on the bottom after just one use. We’ve been extremely careful with these pans and have only been handwashing, so I was surprised and a little disappointed to see these things so quickly.The other issue is that the sides get extremely hot, to the point where I got a pretty bad surface burn just from accidentally grazing the side while reaching for something. Maybe that’s a property of the ceramic cookware, because the pans do get very hot which is great for cooking.Overall we really like the pans and feel they’re a great value for the money, I just wish they didn’t look worn so quickly.

Just buy them!
Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024Color: CreamSize: 12 PieceVerified Purchase
I went back and forth so much on buying these because I was scared of staining. I have had zero issues, no staining etc. they’re beautiful. They come with care directions and just follow them. We never cook on high which is recommended so you dont burn the pan. But this hasn’t been an issue at all and food is still cooked in the same amount of time. They clean so easily as well!

Best pots and pans we have ever owned!
Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2023Verified Purchase
These pots and pans are awesome!  They are heavy, but not too heavy.  I hate thin flimsy pans that lose their shape and get wobbly when you sent them onto a flat surface.  We have had these pans for several years now and they are still in great condition.  We are hard on our pots and pans and yet after a few years we have no scratches, warping, burned surfaces, or surfacing coming off.  They are still 100% non-sticking pans.  They look exotic and expensive, and our guests always ask about them.  What a find!

Very comfortable and warm. Extra length to provide a nice cuff over the ears.
Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2015Size: One SizeColor: BlackVerified Purchase
This is my 2nd purchase of this hat, however, I will tell you why at the end of my review, since this this is supposed to be a review for the item itself and not necessarily just about why I purchased the hat.This Hat would actually be a great warm winter Hat for those SD, ND, MN, WI, NY, PA, etc Type winters.As a Man, this is a great winter Hat that fits great and as expected. It actually exceeded my expectations, especially for the fit and wear & tear you will put it through, as it is a Carhartt. Carhartt means, it was made to be USED and not just worn.  Any man will know the difference between wearing something and actually using it.I have about a Medium size to slightly medium-large sized head. Medium because of the shape and size of my head is Medium like anyone else with a medium sized head.  However, the large part is because the vertical length of my head is slightly longer.  Kind of like your shoe size may really be a size 10, however because you may have wide feet you have to get a size 11 just to accommodate the width, if a size 10W isn't available.If you're looking for a Medium sized hat with a little bit of length to it, then this would be the hat to get.Realistically, the hat is slightly a little bigger because of the length and its new.  However for a Man, it's always good to purchase a hat that is slightly bigger than what you presumably need, because you never know what your going to be stuck doing, like a lot of shoveling or out scraping cars when it's ice cold out and you need that extra part/length of the hat to cuff and cover your ears really well to keep them warm and protected.If you put this hat on all the way w/o cuffing it, and wear/pull it all the way down until there is no more to material to pull down, it will reach to about the base of the head/neck, with still a little slack left over.In terms of long term use and durability, this is also another reason why I love this hat.  As it does have slightly a little extra slack to it.  Depending on your purpose, occupation or whatever the heck you'll be doing that you'll be wearing this hat, it can be adjusted in many different positions.You'll also more than likely you'll end up putting it in the wash.  When you wash this hat, I highly recommend washing it only with other winter type articles of clothing, or maybe a small load of shirts or sweaters at most.  Yes, you could wash it with just a regular full load of laundry or anything else, but I don't recommend it if you want this hat to last a long time. Like anything else in this life, If you take care of it, it will take care of you. The best way to dry it would either be to throw it in the dryer for 5 minutes at the most and let it hang dry. However, if you want to dry it in the dryer all the way, put it on very light heat for about 10 to 15 minutes, or just let the dryer run on air dry with no heat for about 20 to 30 minutes. If you drive too much, that will get more worn Out and used then if you were wearing and using it yourself, which means it won't last long.This is my 2nd year purchasing this exact hat, as I still have the 1st hat from last year.  Except this time/year, I purchased 2 more from Amazon.The 1st hat was purchased at a retail location.  Then I found it online at Amazon for a fraction of the price.  I was hesitant at 1st, because the price on Amazon was substantially lower.  However, when I received these from Amazon, upon further examination, it was the same exact one that I purchased at retail.I purchased additonally hats because I have a habit of losing them. When you find a product or item that works well, especially a winter hat, it's a good idea to purchase a few extra ones.If you lose the only one that you have or if you've really got some really good use out of the one that you have had for a long time and you know it's more than likely it's time for you to throw it out, you know it's going to be close to impossible to find another one again that works exactly like the one that you had and grown accustom to that you know that works. We all know that all good things come to an end  it don't last forever. Then before you know it, your stuck having to go from store to store (site-to-site) to try to find a hat that fits or is comfortable, especially in the middle of winter when you just lost your hat. To top it off, you can no longer find that same exact hat. I've been through that before and it sucks.So in closing this is a very good hat, because of the good comfortable fit, durability, longevity and that It will take good care of you; and especially for the price.  You can't beat the price for the brand that you're getting which also makes it easier to buy extra hats.If you're going to buy extra hats, I recommend buying at least 2 or 3 extra or total of 3 or 4 hats. 1 hat for obvious reasons; an extra 1 at home in case you lose 1, 1 extra one for in your car under your seat in case you forget your hat or lose it while you're out and abou, that way you have an extra one in the car when you need it.  Also, 1 hat left at work.  The extra hats in the car or at work also serve a great purpose for helping somebody else out that may not have a hat that clearly needs one.

Superior Fit, Durability, and Great Value for Harsh Winters
Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2024Size: One SizeColor: BlackVerified Purchase
TLDR: Carhartt Winter Hat - Excellent fit for all head sizes, durable for tough winters. Worth the investment for quality.I recently bought another Carhartt winter hat, making it my second purchase. This hat is incredibly suitable for intense winter climates like those in northern states and offers a snug, comfortable fit for various head sizes.The hat accommodates my medium-large head size comfortably, akin to choosing a shoe size that factors in width. It provides ample room, ensuring that my ears and the back of my neck stay warm, which is crucial during outdoor activities in freezing weather.Its design allows for pulling down the hat for full coverage, reaching the neck base with some slack left for comfort. This adaptability in how it's worn makes it versatile for different weather conditions or activities.Durability is a significant factor in this hat's appeal. True to Carhartt's reputation, it's made for rigorous use, not just as a clothing item but as a practical, hard-wearing accessory.For maintenance, I recommend washing it separately or with similar items, and opting for gentle drying to preserve its quality.I chose to buy additional hats from Amazon due to the lower price compared to physical stores, and the quality was just as good. Having extra hats is practical, considering the likelihood of losing them. Keeping spares at home, in the car, and at work not only ensures I'm always prepared but also allows me to help someone else in need.To sum up, this Carhartt winter hat is a great investment. Its combination of comfort, durability, and affordability makes it an excellent choice, especially for those in colder regions.

I'm not sure why this is advertised as a men's hat.  Carhartt beanies are unisex, whether in smooth or ribbed fabric.  If you want to look at the various ways they are folded and shaped, check out the net.I bought this beanie in Winter-white for a young friend who was brave enough to buy a Winter-white coat.  She reports they look great together.I own a couple of these, in navy, black. They are well-made, maintain their shape and color, and keep your head toasty warm.

I've used plenty of Clinique cosmetics before & consider the quality to be mostly excellent.  When I recently saw this particular lipstick advertised, I couldn't resist trying it, because it seemed to be promising exactly what I want from a lipstick:  to enhance my lip color but without being too obvious, & also moisturize.  The name of the color -""black honey""- plus the way it looks in the tube, was not reassuring, but it really does do what they claim.  Had it been a different brand, I probably wouldn't have tried it- the color doesn't look like what I'd normally wear- but coming from this brand, my curiosity won out, & sure enough it looks nice on me.  Very subtle.

Full open compression cubes a travel changer!
Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024Size: Set of 6Color: 09-Sunset OrangeVerified Purchase
I've been using packing cubes for years now and wouldn't travel without them. But these compression cubes are now my favorites and have me now re-purposing my old packing cubes for things other than traveling. These are lighter weight, have mesh see-thru tops, they compress down to about half their height, are well made, and colorful. They are lightweight but sturdy enough to just stay upright while packing and using them.  I tried a set that was lighter weight but they collapsed when trying to pack and that annoyed me. I also tried a set that was heavier but they were too bulky. These are nice and thin and even have a little pocket to name the type of clothing you have in the bag. I'm glad I got the 6 pack. It gives me many options for arranging the cubes in my luggage along with other items. I prefer to use multiple mid-sized cubes rather than singular large ones so I can designate types of clothing such as: undies & socks, tops, bottoms & dresses, and outerwear. The long narrow ones slip easily between or alongside the mid-size cubes in my luggage, utilizing the space very well. Haven't used the shoe bag yet. Still figuring that one out.When I arrived at our Airbnb, I simply removed the cubes from my luggage, released the compression zippers, and popped them into my drawers perfectly organized. My housemate was envious! Then when we traveled to our next lodging which was a hotel, I transitioned seamlessly as I transferred my packing cubes into those drawers as well. I definitely recommend these for great luggage packing, for function and saving space. And they have a good choice of colors too. The orange ones I got, make me smile:-)

Absolutely Perfect!
Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2022Size: Set of 6Color: 01-Baby PinkVerified Purchase
These are exactly what I wanted!! Here’s the summary but keep reading if you like juicy details:• Great quality zippers and fabric - I don’t worry about it tearing when I’m zipping the compression (but probably still smart to do so carefully)• LOVE the size options - perfect for organizing by type of clothing and easier to Tetris into luggage than more typical ones• love the little pockets included at the bottom of the smallest cubes - didn’t even know it had those but will come in handy!• it’s easy to be tempted to overfill because it seems so roomy when it’s not compressed, but just remember that the compression feature isn’t magic. But it’s also nice that if you do want to overfill and not compress you can too. Choose your own adventure!I’ve been shopping for compression cubes for months now and had a million different ones sitting in my cart, but was too afraid to commit to a set because I was worried it wouldn’t be THE one. I already have two sets of pretty standard packing cubes but have never really loved them, so if I was going to spend $30+ for something I didn’t really need I wanted to love it!!Well, due to an upcoming trip and me running out of time I was forced to choose one, and these were love at first sight! It has all of the features I wanted and they are great quality. The thing I’ve never liked about my old packing cubes is how big they are, because I always had to mix clothes together that I didn’t want to mix (ie swimsuits with pajamas, shirts with bottoms, etc). It was also a pain to pack because the biggest size always took up almost an entire side of the suitcase and really limited what else you could add to that side. These cubes, in my opinion, are PERFECT because you can organize more strategically with the smaller options and pack Tetris style to fit way more. I also love that there’s a little clear pocket on the top of the cube to add a label for each cube for what’s inside!I didn’t think I needed a laundry bag because I usually just bring a garbage bag with me for that, but this will be much classier (ha).As I mentioned above, it’s tempting to overfill because it seems like there’s still so much room left when it’s not compressed, but that feature isn’t magic so just be mindful of that when packing them. But it’s always an option to just stuff it full uncompressed!Anyway, there’s always a risk that you’ll get a damaged product but in my opinion, you will be happy with this purchase!!

            These are exactly what I wanted!! Here’s the summary but keep reading if you like juicy details:• Great quality zippers and fabric - I don’t worry about it tearing when I’m zipping the compression (but probably still smart to do so carefully)• LOVE the size options - perfect for organizing by type of clothing and easier to Tetris into luggage than more typical ones• love the little pockets included at the bottom of the smallest cubes - didn’t even know it had those but will come in handy!• it’s easy to be tempted to overfill because it seems so roomy when it’s not compressed, but just remember that the compression feature isn’t magic. But it’s also nice that if you do want to overfill and not compress you can too. Choose your own adventure!I’ve been shopping for compression cubes for months now and had a million different ones sitting in my cart, but was too afraid to commit to a set because I was worried it wouldn’t be THE one. I already have two sets of pretty standard packing cubes but have never really loved them, so if I was going to spend $30+ for something I didn’t really need I wanted to love it!!Well, due to an upcoming trip and me running out of time I was forced to choose one, and these were love at first sight! It has all of the features I wanted and they are great quality. The thing I’ve never liked about my old packing cubes is how big they are, because I always had to mix clothes together that I didn’t want to mix (ie swimsuits with pajamas, shirts with bottoms, etc). It was also a pain to pack because the biggest size always took up almost an entire side of the suitcase and really limited what else you could add to that side. These cubes, in my opinion, are PERFECT because you can organize more strategically with the smaller options and pack Tetris style to fit way more. I also love that there’s a little clear pocket on the top of the cube to add a label for each cube for what’s inside!I didn’t think I needed a laundry bag because I usually just bring a garbage bag with me for that, but this will be much classier (ha).As I mentioned above, it’s tempting to overfill because it seems like there’s still so much room left when it’s not compressed, but that feature isn’t magic so just be mindful of that when packing them. But it’s always an option to just stuff it full uncompressed!Anyway, there’s always a risk that you’ll get a damaged product but in my opinion, you will be happy with this purchase!!

Good for organizing, not a fan of the compression
Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2024Size: Set of 6Color: 03-Light BlueVerified Purchase
I got the pack of six so I can keep extras on hand for separating dirty clothes. Items arrived in good condition and the zippers feel nice and sturdy. This was my first time trying a zipped compression packing cube, and while the idea seems really cool, the way the cubes compress means that it bulges out more in the middle and is thinnest at the edges, so when I put these in my suitcase there are gaps of space around the edges. It's like I went through all this effort for the compression, but in the end the amount of space I really saved was marginal. I also had to take out one or two things because you have to leave some room in the cubes or they'll get too tight to compress. Also the process of zipping and unzipping the compression made it a real hassle to get clothes in and out every single day. I would probably have saved the same amount of space had I rolled all my clothes, and I would have had more flexibility to jigsaw more things around. I think the compression would work really well for things like thick sweaters or puffer jackets that can actually compress. But for things like regular t-shirts, denim etc, those don't really flatten out much anyway. I will still keep using these for organizing my suitcase, but without using the compression function.

I got these compression packing bags for a trip where I was unsure of the weather and had to pack to adjust for a 4 day allotment to include pants, shirts, sweater and coat but in a carry on. I was able to use these bags to pack all the clothing I needed for both usual and cold weather for a carry on bag, and also pack shoes and heavy socks too. These compressed really well as you use the zipper on them. I like that my clothes were easy to organize in the bags and that you can arrange these bags to contain everything you need within your carry on for a 4-6 day trip, given they way they compress without wrinkling your clothes. It saved time and space and I will use these again. They appear washable, nice sturdy fabric. Easy to grip zippers.

I especially like the fact that these compression socks are rated 15-20 mmHG, a higher level of compression I can't find in socks unless I shop in medical supply stores or online. Also, these socks are SO reasonably priced--3 pair for under $15. Finally, the socks are soft and comfortable, easy to put on. Some compression socks are so stiff I have to struggle to pull them on or off, even with only 8-10 mmHG compression ratings. Charmking socks provide good comfortable support, there are lots of colors to choose from, and they are very reasonably priced.

No swelling after 20+ hours of flying each way! They were very comfortable and I didn't feel like they were strangling my feet or legs.

I bought a $90 tower purifier which took a long time to clear the air and which was noisier than a jet engine. I lived with it, but when the Canadian wildfire smoke descended upon us in NYC, I loaned it to my downstairs neighbor, who had elderly and special needs family members, and I ordered this as a replacement.It's more than double the cost of the other unit, but based on the reviews from the New York Times and other review sites, the quality and performance are well worth the investment. So I splurged and got this unit.While I was waiting for it to arrive, the air pollution got really bad and I had been coughing, eyes were watering and I was forced to wear an N-95 mask at home just to breathe.When the purifier finally arrived, I turned it on and the sensor light went red to indicate the high level of contamination in the air. I opened the doors of every room of my apartment to let it go to work and after a few minutes at full power, the light turned from red to purple, and about 5 minutes later, it went blue. I took my mask off and the air was pure and fresh. It is an absolute superhero at cleaning a large volume of air very quickly. I was thoroughly impressed.The sensor is very sensitive and will turn purple if you are just cooking something that releases strong scents into the air (sauteeing onions and peppers, etc.) and it goes red if you're burning anything.Another upside is that my kitchen smoke detector has stopped going off if I'm grilling something, because the purifier keeps the air quality under control.At the highest setting, it's about as loud as my old purifier at the middle setting, which is to be expected, as you would only set it that high to quickly clear out a room or if there's smoke from cooking, etc.But the massive volume of clean air it blows out in exchange for that short term annoyance is staggering.However, at the 2nd highest setting it is barely detectable, producing a pleasant, white noise background sound that you quickly tune out. It makes falling asleep very easy, and if you have the air conditioner on you can't hear the purifier at all.At it's lowest setting, it blows out a nice stream of air but is utterly and completely silent. You couldn't even hear it at night time in a small, quiet room with the door shut. Amazing.They say you never regret buying the best. They know what they're talking about. This is worth every penny and then some. 5 stars, all day.

All three different filters work, sound of machine is quiet until set to ""high""
Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023Style: AP-1512HH BlackVerified Purchase
The Coway Airmega AP-1512HH is a great quality air purifier with three different filters, which includes a HEPA filter. I found this item after reviewing air purifiers that are best rated for filtering dust, and after purchasing this product I've been very satisfied with the dust removal based on what I see when changing the filters.There are four settings for this product, Low, Medium, High, and Eco (auto adjust setting that changes to Low, Medium, or High based on air quality near the purifier). This product also has four timer settings; 1, 4 and 8 hour, or continuous-run.Air quality is rated by the purifier based on color. blue is good, purple is ok, red is bad. If your purifier is set to Eco setting, the fan will run at Low for blue, Medium for purple, and High for red.Sound is very quiet at Low and Medium settings. High setting is loud, but with how quickly the air quality goes from red to blue at the high setting I don't personally mind the sound.Weight of machine is very light, it can be picked up with one hand and moved easily to wherever you want it to sit. It's larger than select other air purifiers, but that is because it filters more surface area than smaller air purifiers. The size is comparable to a small tv that your grandparents would have in their wallpaper kitchen wherever it would fit.I would suggest this air purifier to anyone looking to purify rooms that are contaminated with dust, mites, mold, air particles, hair, unpleasant smells, etc.

Excellent air purifier for the long haul
Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024Style: AP-1512HH WhiteVerified Purchase
I have two Coway air purifiers in my apartment and have run them non-stop for nearly 5 years, aside from cleaning and changing filters. Online reviews said they are durable and this is quite true. Some of my favorite features:- Easy to service. There are three layers of filtration - a screen behind the front cover that captures lint, hair, large items, an activated charcoal filter to remove odors and a true HEPA filter behind that. Removing the outer cover to vacuum the screen is very easy. Accessing the other filters is also a snap.- Very durable. As I mentioned, mine are nearly 5 years old and one has always been in a room with my two boys, so seen its fair share of knocks.- Ability to run int auto mode where it speeds up if it detects pollutants- Adjustable sensitivity to pollutants- Three fan speeds. The first two are nearly silent. The 3rd (high) makes a decent amount of noise, but the only time I ever use high is during extreme wildfire/smog events or if cooking something smokey. Middle speed moves plenty of air and should be all you need.The only con I can think of is that my interior designer wife is not crazy about their appearance. Doesn't bother me. One of my favorite home products.

I got this for my BF since he loves a specific candle from B&BW. He liked to light the candle, but I’m fearful of accidental fires since my ex sis and law nearly burned down her house by leaving an unattended lit candle (the bathroom started on fire and the only reason the rest of the house didn’t burn down was because the pipes in the bathroom melted and sprayed water throughout that section of the house, putting out the fire. Her house was unlivable for about 8 months while it had to be repaired.) I’m glad I found this item. I have it set on a timer to turn on about 2 hours before he gets home, and shuts off about bedtime.  He has the scent of his favorite candle in the room. He also noticed that the candle (which usually costs about $25 each!) lasts WAY longer using this lamp.I bought a second one of these and have it in my home office for my own favorite candles.

The warmer came with two light bulbs.  The first time I used it for about 4 hours.  Three days later I went to use it and the bulb immediately blew.  The second bulb has been working well with occasional usage up to 4 hours 2-3 times a week since the beginning of the month.  It's beautiful, it seems safe, the light it emits is arguably as beautiful as the flame the candle would, the smell is just as strong.  It fits my yankee signature tumbler and large jar candles.  I only took off one star because I'm one bulb down with less than a month of use.  I would still recommend this burner.

Shipping was quick, arrived in tact and well packaged.  It was a struggle to get it out of the packaging, but once I did, I was so pleased with the look of this necklace.  It will go perfectly with my glittery top for an event I am attending this month.  It looks so classy and the perfect length.  The bracelet is a nice touch as well and looks beautiful on.  Very heavy and sturdy.  I'd highly recommend to anyone that like this style of chain and bracelet.

Costume jewelry, don’t think your getting something you can go out and rock as the real thing right! But for costume jewelry, it is good.  I got it for my two dogs. One for my big dog and one for my small dog and they work fine.  The dogs have been using them for a while and they still are good in color.  My dogs also go outside, my big dog goes in a pond all the time too and I don’t take it off. So it is good quality for cheap quality.

Sleek and Secure: The Ultimate Black Travel Backpack for Work!
Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2024Color: 01-blackSize: 15.6 InchVerified Purchase
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Let me start by saying, this black Travel Backpack is an absolute game-changer for work commuters like myself!First off, can we talk about its sleek look? It's like the James Bond of backpacks – effortlessly cool and stylish. I feel like a secret agent on a mission every time I sling it over my shoulder.But it's not just about looks – this backpack is incredibly functional too. The multitude of pockets is a lifesaver for staying organized. I can stash my laptop, tablet, phone, chargers, and even a spare change of clothes without breaking a sweat. Plus, the anti-theft design adds an extra layer of security, giving me peace of mind when navigating crowded city streets or packed public transportation.Speaking of devices, the padding for laptops and tablets is top-notch. I never have to worry about my precious gadgets getting banged up during my daily commute. The backpack cradles them like a protective cocoon, ensuring they arrive at my destination unscathed.And can we talk about comfort? The padded straps make carrying a breeze, even when fully loaded. No more sore shoulders or awkward shifting – this backpack distributes weight like a champ, making long commutes a walk in the park.Overall, I couldn't be happier with this black Travel Backpack. It's stylish, practical, and durable – everything I need for conquering the urban jungle. If you're in the market for a new work backpack, look no further. This one's a winner! 🎒🏙️

Attractive zipper pulls with a curved indent to smoothly fit the thumb, inside fabric light color and stain resistent, storage holders functional - water, pockets, secure key, and so on. Fabric flattens if not too much inside and expands to hold a good amount. Ergo design shoulder straps with padding as well as back padding. Fabulous Find for city toting and long travel trips.

I love this bag. It’s exactly what I needed for commuting to work.It is spacious enough to fit everything I need for the day including lunch, workout clothes, computer, etc. I love the compartments and pockets.The large compartment opens wide, the bottom of the bag is deep and wide to fit large items like shoes or a lunch bag. The side pockets expand and fit my coffee and water bottles. The straps are thick, cushioned, and comfortable for extended wear. The material is water resistant. There is a trolley strap for hooking on luggage. There are so many little details that elevate this backpack: key latch, back zip pocket for a passport or other sensitive items, wet pocket for wet items, etc etc etc.In addition to the great functionality the backpack has a sleek aesthetic with rose gold colored hardware.I cannot say enough about this bag. It’s exactly what I was looking for. I am a very happy customer!

Stylish Bag, Lots of Pockets, Heavy
Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2023Color: 01-blackSize: 15.6 InchVerified Purchase
Overall, I'd recommend for simple daily short-term use. Would not recommend for travel.Just came back from a month long trip in Japan with this backpack. I didn't use it as my day-pack but toted around most of my carry-on stuff between cities in this. It's durable and well made and I do love all the pockets so I can separate all my stuff. However, what I noticed when I first received it and while I was travelling, was that it's quite heavy. With all the extra pockets, padding, and metal hardware, the bag even when it's empty is quite heavy. Because of this I wouldn't recommend it for travelling and I'll probably keep this one for short/easy trips from now on. If you're planning to use the backpack mainly for day-to-day, such as going to/from work or school, it's a good bag I think. It's very stylish and I love the look of it. The material is a tad shiny so it gives it a nice appearance. And even though it was heavy it was at least comfortable and didn't dig into my shoulders too much, as the straps were nicely padded.

I looked at several well-known name-brand travel backpacks and was disappointed with the quality/price of each after going to the physical store and feeling/trying on each bag (note one was $500!). I was in a time crunch for travel and bought this bag in Black based on good reviews and just needed something. Figured I couldn't lose for the price. I am SO impressed. Great options for storage/organization. Great structure--it doesn't sag but is still flexible to easily fit in many items. Note: I can't comment on long-term wear yet. But I took this on a 10 day trip and the bag still looks new--no snags, rips, or issues.

I bought this backpack for my middle schooler as a replacement for their school backpack that had fallen apart.  I’m pleasantly surprised at how spacious it is. Tons of storage compartments & zipper pockets.  I really like tge ‘secret’ zipper pocket in the back. It’s perfect to put their cell phone during the school day.The complaints (very minor though) are the zipper pulls are gold & the side water bottle pockets are not big enough for bigger water bottles.  But neither are deal breakers.  This feels like a very sturdy backpack that hopefully will last several years.

I'm reordering the next size up even tho I followed the guide for 40-55 lb dogs. (size 5).We have an Aussiedoodle and he has a lot of fluff around his feet. These boots seem to work pretty well - they definitely didn't come off. Our dog walked around like he was tipsy but he is very tolerant.The weather has been brutal with wind chills in the -20s on some mornings. In order for him to go out and take care of business, we need to protect his feet as much as we can.These little boots have a light fleece lining on the bottoms and they slip on pretty well. NOTE: The little yellow paw print on the boot tells you which side to put them on. I didn't get that at first and they actually fit better mismatched. BUT now we try to get them on the right side.NOTE: the velco is VERY strong. If Seppy sits down on a rug with them on and the strap is not pulled around the back of his foot, the boot sticks to the rug and pulls off. That is a lesson learned to just make sure the boots are snugged on as much as safely possible. Don't want them too tight for fear of affecting his circulation.Our dog is a 46.2 lb Aussiedoodle. I measured his feet (2.2 inches) and followed the guide. Ordered a size 5. They do seem to fit over his whole paw but I worry about them being just a little too tight on the fronts of the paws. So I re-ordered a 2nd pair in a size 6 just so the backs of the boots pull up a little more. Hoping that helps his feet feel more comfortable.So far so good. They have provided him with some relief so he can stay out for almost 15 minutes in the subzero temps. Without them, he lifts his leg and holds it up and doesn't want to move. These allow him to trot around a little bit and will get us to Spring.

The dog shoes seem to be well made and they fit pretty good but they have a couple inherent problems. They wont stay on my 50 lb Husky. They should be made so that the top of each boot is longer, and maybe they would have a better chance of staying on. Also because they are short, the exposed velcro material that is not covered when the straps are secured, tries to attach itself to throw rugs and some other carpets she walks on..which in turn makes it even more laborious for the old dog to walk around.The reason i tried these boots is that she drags 1 foot a little which is affecting her ability to walk on hard surfaces with out slipping and falling.These may work better on smaller dogs that have shortere legs.

70 lb Aussie/Pyrenees mix, size 5. Measured his paws & bought according to size chart. They fit very well. Do not skip out on getting proper measurements and following the chart!Just like I have experienced with other dog boots, you have to make them pretty snug in order for them to stay on. The Velcro on these is way better than other boots I have previously bought. Dog will get used to them and be able to walk just fine if you give it time and work with them. It’s not going to instantly happen. If they fall off you need to make the Velcro tighter. It’s just like trying to run in untied shoes, they have to be snug to stay on!This company was the first, in my experience , that provided good information to customers on how to get your dog used to them (mine already trained to wear but I was still very impressed).I’m not sure why they have poor reviews or many returns. I would guess it’s from improper size selection or not knowing how to use them. You’re going to have to train your dog to get used to them. As someone who has experience with purchasing, these boots were great and I would buy again!

I returned it the same day and I received the correct style shoe the next day which  was a Sunday.  I am truly appreciative to Amazon as they try their best to correct mistakes.

Wow!! Excellent support, roomy toe box  and trendy!
Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024Size: 9.5Color: White SmoothVerified Purchase
I have tried countless white tennis shoes, in search of something that would work for me.( I have unique shoe needs as I walk with two crutches, have fallen arches, and have muscle weakness in my legs/feet, which requires really supportive shoes). I have tried so many brands and nothing has worked. These are perfect for me and are keepers!! The arch support is perfect. Arch isn’t too high and isn’t too low. They are extremely supportive. The toebox is roomy!! Hard to find that in today’s world.  I need room in my toes so they spread out and these shoes are perfect. I bought a 9 1/2 which works perfectly. I’m typically a nine or 9 1/2 depending on the make.  I can wear them with socks, or without. The only downside is the sole. The sole is not as “grippy” as I would like and tends to slip a little in hardwood floors, so I will be adding something to the soles to make them more nonslip. Other than that, these are fantastic and I’m considering buying a second pair. Thanks Dr Scholls!

These shoes are great and super comfortable. I wore them almost every single day in Japan, walking about 30,000 steps per day, for 30 days. The only thing is they do not breathe. My feet got very hot and they got kinda smelly. I don't typically have smelly feet. Also, if you look at the shoes wrong, they scuff. Bring a shoe scrub to clean them every night otherwise they look super dirty. If I didn't have to constantly clean them and if they breathed, I would have given them a 5/5..but it's more of a 3.5/5 for me.

Considering the price of a Dyson Airstraight, I think this is a great value for a carrying case that will keep a very expensive product from getting damaged. It's lightweight, yet sturdy enough to cushion and protect what's inside. I personally don't own a Dyson but this carrying case fits both my curler and straightener inside so that the screws to my curler won't snag any of my clothes when packing in a travel bag.

I looked high and low for a case that would hold my hot air hand unit. I finally found this one that looked like the measurements were the correct size and ordered it. Lo and behold it fit with a couple inches to spare. With the zippered portion of the case providing a secure place for my hot air gun. On top of the zippered pocket are a couple Velcro straps to hold whatever additional accessories you may require. The case is constructed with hard sides that feel like they will provide good protection for your stuff. The zipper pulls are nice and large and the zipper action is nice and smooth. All in all, a very good case. Recommended.

Great value and incredibly fun
Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2021Verified Purchase
Got it for my 14 year old who is 5'4"". It fits them great and they absolutely love it. They have to pedal a little on steeper hills, but otherwise pedaling is pretty much optional. My kid loves the speed, quick but not uncomfortably fast. The charge seems to last decently but we haven't tested it. It was not hard to put together at all. The included tool is very cheap but does the job very well. We didn't trust the phone holder (no support from the bottom, just seems like it might fall out), so we added one on our own. We just flipped the old one around and we still have a charging port for their phone. Seat is reasonably comfortable. Folds down nice and small to fit in pretty much any vehicle. Very good for the price so far. We've only had it for a month and a half. I will update this review if things start to go poorly.

Good value but has some flaws
Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2021Verified Purchase
I give the bike 3 stars and the customer support 5 stars, so I used the avg of 4 to rate the bike overall. It's a good value but I ran into problems. Fortunately customer support helped me out and now the bike works well.Initially the bike arrived with a dead battery. It would cut off then completely stopped working. Cust support sent me a new battery but it took almost 3 weeks (coming from china). Got the bike running then the motor quit on me. Found out it shorted internally, maybe windings melted together. Cust support sent me a new motor. After installing it now works. Customer support was very fast and responsive. Parts ship from china so it takes weeks. The bike itself is probably warehoused in USA so the initial delivery is fairly fast for a 60 lb item.Review of the bike minus my warranty issues: I was looking for a 20 inch (tire) small bike for a small person to ride. This bike fits little people very well as the seat can go pretty far down and the frame is easy to step over. I like that it folds, and the battery and controller are hidden inside. Yes many chinese bikes are similar, and I like the design so I sought out a bike where the electric parts (batt + controller) were hidden inside the frame. The bike doesn't have cruise control, a major bummer. I will replace the controller with one that has cruise - it comes in handy. There are many controllers that are same size/wiring/functions available for 65 bux or less. I got ergonomic grips, a must for all bikes, get the twist throttle type. I ditched the cell phone holder, it worked ok but I only trust RAM mounts as i had a phone go flying off a bike once (not this one though). Headlight is nice but i wish (none currently) it came with a tail light. I added a battery powered one for cheap. The rack is strong and handy. I didn't install the fenders because they don't work with my bike storage system - they are sturdy metal and seem to be nice. removed the kick stand. The front fork will min/max out if you ride rough sidewalks etc. Remember this is a very inexpensive bike, other bikes of higher quality are 2k$ more in cost. 20 inch wheels offer a bit of a bumpy ride vs 26 inch wheels but I wanted a small bike. My frame seemed to have metal shavings under the paint so quality in production is iffy. It will arrive well packed but expect some scratches, it's a 60 lb package. My seat has a small tear but idk if I will keep the seat. The biggest deal next to no cruise control is that you can only pedal at 12ish MPH. the bike goes 18 mph at top speed so its impossible to pedal at full speed. It's the 20 inch wheel plus gearing. The bike needs a much larger chainring. Also I tried to remove the crank arms but the threads are totally stripped where you screw in the tool to remove the cranks, so I will need to use an angle grinder to get the cranks off - required to replace the chainring.

Slightly larger and with suspension.  Far better ride than I expected.  I’ve owned 9 Ancheer, DYU and Jetson folding bikes.  Yes it’s heavier and could use a bigger battery but it’s truly their best yet…!

Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2024Verified Purchase
only had this bike 6 months and now it will not power up battery is ok but will not power up it is dead. this is the 20 inch folding e-bike. when you turn the key to on and push red button to on it will not power up. wrote seller on amazon website and they want me to send them a video of what is going on with the bike. i do not have that ability to do that i am not capable of doing that. very disappointed in this bike. and the warranty that is provided. i would never buy from this company again because they do not care if you are satisfied with their bikes. please keep tis in mind before spending money or this bike. not happy with amazon selling these crappy bikes with virtually no warranty support buyer beware or you will be stuck with eventually a very expensive peddle bike.

Awesome Purchase and product.
Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2024Style: UrbanVerified Purchase
Awesome Purchase and product. I'm very happy with the E bike, my kid loves it. He rides every day until the battery drops to one bar while just playing with it around our neighborhood. We have taken it on two long (paved) trail rides, 1st one 8 miles Gulf Shore State Park and today another 9.5 miles on the Munson Heritage Bike Trail.  I will upload some photos and video in a day or so. Highly recommend this mini-E bike

Haven’t cleaned so much in such little tone
Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024Color: WhiteVerified Purchase
I’ve always cleaned manually with brushes and rags. But a YouTuber mentioned something like this and I thought heck let me try it. I love this set. The charge lasts forever. I used several heads for various purposes including blue for washing my hardwood floors, white fluffy for mirrors, hard bristles for shower, etc. The blue cleans windows in seconds. I cleaned 3 bathrooms in no time and still have 85% charge. The heads were difficult to remove and change at first but basically you just wiggle them back and forth and pull with force. If you are elderly or have weak hands this may be a bit of a struggle for you. But three of the attachments Velcro to a single base so you can definitely uses those.I am buying replacements heads now bec I know I’m keeping this for a while. Highly recommend.

Reduced my workload…😍
Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2023Verified Purchase
Usually, I clean the shower tiles by hand. It's difficult for me to become older. After seeing this, I tried it. Whoa. Our shower tile appears to be brand-new! After 12 years in this house, I've cleaned it frequently, but no matter how much I washed, the grout always seemed a bit dirty (like a light yellow tint). I never imagined that the grout could be restored to its original brilliant white color. Furthermore, the tile also gleams. (I cleaned the tile with Dawn and the grout with a mixture of Dawn and Clorox cleaning gel.) It used to take a lot of effort and time to manually clean the tile. Like no other, this bad boy makes things easy and completes the task at hand. I'm excited to use it to clean new things that I find! It's rechargeable, which I adore, and it's really strong. I just started using it last week, so I'll check back in a few months to see whether it's still functioning.

It scrubs, but it's still a workout!
Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
I used it to do a deep cleaning of an average-sized bathroom. While it is helpful to have a battery operated scrubber, you do still have to do the manual work of getting the not-so-light scrubber in the right areas and it starts to tire your arms. I had to bend over the whole time, so wasn't that great on the back either. However, I rationalized it as the nature of the cleaning I was doing, and I was trying to be very meticulous about cleaning every bit of the floor. The bigger disappointment was that the battery didn't last long enough and I had to recharge it to finish the last bit of the bathroom. I'm guessing for a more general clean, it wouldn't have been a problem, but if you are planning on doing some deep cleaning, keep that in mind!

            I’ve had enso rings in the past and they were great and so is this one. The new designs are really nice. I work in construction and I don’t have to worry about my really ring but I still have something that looks good.

Bridge of nose
Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024Color: BlueVerified Purchase
As others have said. The space for your nose isn’t great. But if you move strap upward a little bit at the back of your head, it changes where it touches your nose. So that’s not a huge problem. Also a couple people have said it sounds like an MRI lol I had just had an MRI a week before I got this and that is not the case. It makes subtle noises, but nothing grinding, and hammering. I have dry eye issues, and it’s actually been very soothing. The tighter, the strap, the more intense the massage.

I don't know the size of the motor, but it's a strong one.Heat is also strong.Inside felt is soft and easy to wear.Light weight and not an issue for wearing for long periods of time.For the not so good.Pulse function is useless.Bluetooth is a nice feature but it's not loud enough. The stock ""ocean sound"" is kind of annoying.The only major issue is that it sits right on the top of the bridge of your nose. Uncomfortable unless you position it just right.Overall, it helps me with my headaches and I can't complain too much.

Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021Color: BlueVerified Purchase
My husband suffers from migrains quite often. Originally I ordered this for him to try, I thought after a long day at work, he works 2nd shift, and after a hot shower he could wear this to wind down and relax to fall asleep. I actually had a tooth pulled a couple days ago and my head was pounding so bad. As soon as I got home I saw this massager on my nightstand I decided to give it a try and I am so happy I did. Between the vibrations and the heat it truly did relieve some of my discomfort. I just realized you can actually connect your phone through bluetooth and you can play music while you wear it. It is cordless so just make sure you charge it through the micro usb prior to use. When it arrived I charged it over night and we have used it quite a few times and it still has a full battery. The elastic that goes around your head is adjustable so it can definitely fit a range of different sized heads. The part that rests on your skin feels like a micro suede or something similar, it is very soft and feels really nice. My husband has noticed since I got him in the routine of using this as often as we can he does suffer from less migrains. It is a little costly but I believe it is definitely worth the cost. I hope we have it for a long time because it is very handy.

Great eye massage kit!

I haven't had an eye massager before to compare my experience with, but surely, it was very interesting and surprisingly effective.I would recommend it to try in the morning when getting up or after work.It provides the warm and gentle eye massage that would soothe sore eyes in the morning or after long hours of computing/ screen viewing.If you pair via Bluetooth, you can also play any preferred tunes during the massage session.You would need to press the power button for about 3 seconds to start your session and toggle between different mode each time of pushing the button.It does make some operation mechanical noise, but it is manageable and not annoying IMO. (You can always listen in your favorite tunes to bypass the noise)It has been 2 months of use and I experienced no issues yet. Recommend to anyone-

Great warranty- just not for me
Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2023Color: GrayVerified Purchase
So first off let me say that out of the eye massagers this one seemed to have a solid warranty which I feel matter when u buy techy stuff. This is why I picked this one. The temple massage pressure points felt great- I did not like the vibe tarot message on my forehead it made me feel a bit nauseous. I got this for migraines. With that said I am both light n sound sensitive when I have one. This machine is a bit loud and that wasn’t something I loved. It honestly reminds me of the sounds you hear when you get an MRI which didn’t create a relaxing feel for me personality. So if you aren’t sound sensitive this is probs my a great device it just didn’t work for me and my personal needs. It’s pleasing to look at and a sharp design tho.

I originally bought the black frame grey lenses and ended up loving it so much I ordered a second pair with pink lenses. The grey has a tint that is very neutral that would be similar to window tint on a car. The pink lenses have a slight green tint which is expected with the lens color. Both pairs fold perfectly and are very pocketable. My only complaint is that I wish the case that comes with them was slimmer and didn’t leave room for the glasses to rattle around.

Beautiful Lenses but not as Functional as I thought...
Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2018Color: Gold - Pink MirrorLens Width: 58 MillimetersVerified Purchase
I have had these sunnies for almost 2 months now and I have mixed feelings. I REALLY like the color of the lens and frames. The pink is beautiful and I get tons of compliments! They are nicely compact which fit well in a small cross body bag for outings.The downside(s): the folding hinge right on the temple scratches the inside of the lens when I go to put them away. I have to wrap the lens with the cleaning cloth before I fold them to put them in their case. The other issue was that the nose pad popped off on one side after using them only 7-10 times and I still can't get it back on the pad arm correctly. Lastly, the hinges have becomes really loose over the short period of time that I have used them. When I want to take the off and set them down on my desk or counter, they fold up and it causes the lenses to hit the counter. I haven't scratched them ye, but this is a two handed job to set them down without them folding in and falling forward.If I could do over, I would probably have spent the additional money on RayBans.

These are very good sunglasses!  With the writing on the glasses they look like ray bans  at a quick glance at  a fraction of the cost .  They are polarized I used a test card to verify.  They come with a nice case and are easy to fold .  I use these on a hazy day or cloudy day or maybe late afternoon early evening when sun is going down.  I don’t use in very bright sun they are not designed for that in my opinion. I use mirror aviators or a darker shade of tint in bright sunlight conditions .

These polarized sunglasses are great. The quality is as good as more expensive brands like RayBans or Maui Jims, with the added benefit that they fold, and are very compact. They come with a black leather case and cleaning cloth, The size of the case is a little less than half the size of regular sunglasses. My husband loves them because they fit in his shirt pocket. I ordered the silver mirrored for him, and I am seriously considering ordering a pair for myself. We can’t review their durability because this is a recent purchase.

Almost perfect!
Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2019Color: Black - BlackLens Width: 58 MillimetersVerified Purchase
These sunglasses have been great so far. The polarized lenses and frame quality are great. I bought them for a trip to Cancun and they worked perfectly for what I wanted. For frame reference I wear a large in Costa Del Mar sunglasses. I purchased the aviators frames and they were a little tight on my face but in the heat they eventually stretched to fit my face better not causing any pain or headaches. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because right off the bat while folding them the arms scratched the inner part of the lens by the nose piece. This could have been user error and since then I've watched the video online how they recommend folding them but even after following their recommendation I still have to help the arms fold in or it will still scratch the lense. The actual scratches how ever don't interrupt field of view so I don't really care...Im the only one who knows they are there. Worth the buy if you want a pair of fair priced glasses while on the move that have exceptional lens quality for the price!

Absolutely worth the buy for anyone looking for a starter gaming headset.
Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2018Color: BlueVerified Purchase
I got this in a rush when I needed a new headset. In hindsight a bit more research would have had me getting something else. As a precursor to the review I feel that it is worth noting that I am very rough on audio peripherals. I don't know why, but they usually last me about 6 months regardless of the quality and price. This is why I choose to buy at a cheaper price point more frequently rather than high-end less frequently.Pros:Price for the quality is greatDecent speaker/mic soundGood quality cable that is at least 6' longSits comfortably on the headStereo/mic to separate stereo and mic connector includedIn-line mic mute switch and audio volume adjustmentCons:The USB is only a power source for the blue lights on the headset (it is a bit misleading in its uses, but if I had researched it a bit more I would have found this out before purchase)The in-line mute and volume knob would be better with a mic gain knob as wellIt tends to make my head a bit sweaty (I have long hair and live in South Texas, US. So it is hard to find headsets that don't do that, but still something to keep in mind)The headset only goes on one way (The traditional right and left side is enforced by the mic only being usable one way. I know I am in the minority, but I like the mic being on the right side of my head)So this is absolutely worth the money, but if you are looking for a high-end headset this is not it. I know my cons were a bit nit picky, and I don't want anyone to think that I regret this purchase. I knew I was getting a quick solution to needing a headset, and I honestly got more than I was looking for. The USB lighting, while completely useless, is a cool addition. The only reason it didn't make it into the pros section is because unless you want to look cool on stream it is wasted resources.So, yea. If you want a good quality headset for a good price this is great for you.

It’s like going to a salon… but at home? For less than 20 dollars!
Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2024Color: Ma DamnVerified Purchase
I have tried A LOT of press on nail brands, and glamnetic has given me the best results. They last a long time, and look like you went to the salon and got them professionally done. They are easy to put on but easier when you have help because the glue is so sticky, it gets on the skin and is hard to get off. When I put these on, I put glue on the nail and my nail bed and then press down for 20 seconds or so to make sure it’s really on there. For the most part, they stay on! Great way to save money and have great, long nails!

I have had these on for 2 weeks and have only had to re-glue 2 nails. I am very happy with them!I was an every 3 weeks girl going to the nail salon and getting dip but I got sick of sitting there and paying the money. These nails are cute, easy to put on, and durable. The black tip started to peel after about a 1.5 weeks but i really dont mind that — the prep work is key to getting these to stay on. buff the tops of your nails AND the inside of the fake nail, then wipe your nail with the alcohol wipe. this really helps it stay & picking a nail that properly fits you.10/10 recommend and will be buying more!

nails are okay, not the best
Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2024Color: CaviarVerified Purchase
These nails look great initially, but putting them on is a hassle. Using the glue is a mess and the glue stays on your nails for weeks and would not come off. They looked nice the first day of wearing them and then a couple days later, they start to fall off, chip, and then they are a pain to remove. If you want to use these for  special occasions, they are okay, but for longer use, I would not recommend.

My first Glamnetic set!
Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2024Color: Pure IntensionsVerified Purchase
I used to use primarily Kiss IMPRESS nails, until they started making them so thin that the nails often bent (especially with almond styles) and the adhesive would only last a few days (even with using glue, too).  I was dropping so much money and having to change my nails every 4-5 days.  I started buying Btartbox and eventually tried Glamnetic.  I love that these nails do not bend or break ever.  The color also does not chip off, like Kiss’s patterned nails do.  I use Btartbox’s adhesive pads, in addition to regular nail glue, and these babies stay on for over two weeks!  I have yet to have one fall off.  However, these also are not reusable for me.  I don’t trust just nail glue to keep nails on (I work a lot with my hands), so having to remove the nails with the adhesive pads usually ruins them.  HOWEVER, it’s still cheaper than going to the salon and I can also remove them myself.  I wish Glamnetic made more designs that weren’t semi-transparent.  I think it looks tacky when you can see a person’s nails through their fake ones.  Plus, there’s almost always an air bubble or two that shows when the nails are see-through.  I do wish the price point was a bit lower.  The prices are lower when you buy in stores, but the design and color options are small in comparison to Amazon.

Impressive strength
Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2024Color: CaviarVerified Purchase
The strength of these nails are very impressive. They are very sturdy. I have been wearing them for a week now and they have not cracked or bent. They are also a good length a little long for being labeled short but not excessive. The design is really pretty and I've received a lot of compliments. However, the design did not last long and almost immediately begin chipping.Some cons:The nail size options are definitely made for more dainty women. There are not a lot of nail sizes for us manhand ladies so I had to do some customization and that was annoying.As previously mentioned, the design started chipping almost immediately, so next time I would probably seal them with a gel top coat. Which again is annoying because if I wanted to do gel nails I wouldn't have bought press ons.I have no idea the quality of the glue. I use super glue and acrylic. However, most glue that comes with press on nails is not great so I wouldn't put a lot of faith into it.Overall I would purchase this brand again based on nail strength alone.

Less than impressed
Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2024Color: Cherry GlazeVerified Purchase
Absolutely beautiful color! And that is the best thing that I can say about these nails, unfortunately.The nails are thicker than the normal glue/press-on nails, so on appearance, you will be filled with confidence that these glue on nails will be different from all the others. Especially because they cost so much more than others!Also, this is definitely a user caused problem but something to be mindful of...I am not overly skilled at putting on fake nails, so I routinely will glue my nail and/or fingers together. With that in mind, I was disappointed that when I inevitably did just that, the nail lost its shine and then there was my fingerprint on the nail! I have never experienced that with other brands. I scraped the nail on something, as well, and the color was completely gone in that place.I really wanted to love them but I *really* did not.The nails lasted less than 7 days, overall. The first nail popped off on day 4 when opening a can of pop...which I totally ""get"" is not something any press/glue on nail is going to do successfully, but let's be real, if I can't live my life when I have these things on my nails, I am just setting myself up for disappointment. The next nail was loose the following day and I easily removed it without any force, so it was just waiting to go. I glued both of the nails back on the following morning, so we're at day 6 at this point for the other nails that haven't needed to be re-applied. That evening, when I went to get something out of my purse, the third nail flew off because I must have bumped it at just the right spot. Before I went to bed, I soaked my hands in warm water for over 10 minutes and the nails were loose, so I gently removed them, as per removal instructions...only to see how damaged they had made my natural nails. Part of it was glue but the actual nail was split in places and they feel very weak. I have an Essie nail repair polish, so after I buffed off the glue, I applied that polish. My nails will be recovering from this for a while.I have an office job and I work on a computer all day. I have 2 dogs, a cat, and a husband. I have a home that needs cleaned constantly. I cook 7 days a week, so lots of dishes to wash, but I do use rubber gloves. All that to say, I use my hands a lot but not in a rough, physical environment. Just normal, every day life.For the price, I would expect to get more than 6 days. I have heard others online say to throw out the glue it comes with and use some other glue, so maybe try that? Otherwise, temper your expectations that these are good for 1 special event and not much more.

These are extremely well constructed. They installed well and the waterproof construction is spot on - no problems anticipated. It's tie in for mobile use is good as the remote is the slim type either easily lost or damaged. There are a myriad of controls as well so it really does allow you to adjust it to the season for a year round install. But the colors just never strike right. There is something about them that is not true and for that reason we may not leave it up. We have other LED on the property and have not had an issue getting a true green or red, but we did here. At lower settings its less pronounced but with effects and at a higher brightness it's just off.

I am working in placing permanent lights on my house so I don't have to put them up every year for the holidays. The lights will be used as decor and also (when needed) can be used for security purposes. This set of lights is a secondary one that will go along the eaves at the end of the house above the garage. They are easy to work with and install and the app control gives you many options in controlling them.I'd recommend these to anyone.

The only way I'll do Christmas lights from now on.
Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
I really like these lights... a lot.  They're bright, they look great on my house, and they're the only way I'll do Christmas lights, going forward.  I love that they're designed to stay up permanently, so I only have to mess with a ladder and risk a fall once... not twice every year :).Once they're up, they blend in aren't noticeable at all (when off), so I have no issues with leaving them up year-round.  Installation was easy, and I found that the double-sided tape made things easier than installing traditional christmas lights (since they stay in place while you're working with them).  I love the ability to change the colors, change the patterns/effects, and fine-tune the lights to my liking via the app... I'm able to change up the look of my house/lighting anytime that I feel like it.  Connecting them to the app was easy, and I also love that they're ""smart"" so I can set them up on a timer to come on and go off automaticall.They really thought of everything with these, I'll never go back to traditional Christmas lights.Highly Recommended - I really like them.

Avoid These Lights - They Have No Memory Function
Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2023Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
I had high expectations for these lights.  After installing them, which took some time and at heights I don't like very much, I set them to a cool color combination of red and green.  Next day, the lights came on and they were all red.  I reset them to the red and green again and turned the lights off.  When I turned them back on, they were all red again.  These have no memory function.  This is completely unacceptable for PERMANENT outdoor lights and especially at this price point.  You have to set the lights every single time they turn off.  I highly recommend avoiding these and looking for a set that will save whatever the last light setting was.

Easy install and setup
Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
The only downside I really had with this product is that you can't get the wires and everything in white. I really think if the wiring and all the equipment was white it would blend in even better as I would imagine most people don't have black eaves on their houses where they are mounting their lights.That being said the installation was easy and the 3M tape on the back of each light so far has held really well even with all the rain they have been exposed to since I installed them. It was good they come also with clear screw on brackets as there were quite a few I mounted that naturally well on the crack of the eave coverings or grated areas and couldn't stick as well.As for programming the lights it was easy to setup automation for automatic on and off based on time of day but I haven't been able to figure out how to program the light colors outside of the preset modes. For example their Christmas mode is the running light segments alternating red, blue, green, yellow, purple, etc and back around. I can't find a setting for just red and green or how to make my own programming for just two colors.

Bright and pretty smart lights
Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2023Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
I wanted to add some additional holiday lights to my house. I saw this and was impressed that it is able to integrate with my smart home system. Setting up the lights was about as difficult as any other strand of outdoor lights would be. Each light has its own adhesive backing. I did some research and discovered that this adhesive is very strong and gets stronger with time. While I want the lights to stay up year round, I wasn't sure I wanted to leave them up that permanently. The kit came with a screw in solution, however the screws were very small I didn't have confidence that they would be enough. I eventually decided to use a 3rd party cord fastener. The kit comes with five strands that can be connected via a three-prong waterproof plug. Each connector has a cap. I was able to use the cap to keep the end waterproof.After hanging them up, I was attempted to set up the lights using the Smart Life app. Unlike other Smart Life IOT devices, the lights were not detected automatically. I was able to set them up manually. Once set up, I was able to control them using the app or via voice commands. The app provides a lot of flexibility including setting up various scenes. My wife and I tried out the many included themes until we found one that we liked. The lights are bright and I like the colors. About the only thing I wish was different is that I wish I could control individual lights through some sort of interface. I really like these lights and look forward to using them year after year.

BEST hands-free leash! Great for traveling and dogs who pull
Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024Color: Black/BlackVerified Purchase
I absolutely love this hands free leash that even comes with a POUCH! It’s perfect for traveling with your dog. I take it with me when I take my dog on walks and even when we travel using the train or the plane. The pouch is very accessible and makes it easy to have treats on hand when needed. I also used to store my wallet and my dog’s treat when we traveled with made it easier to access my ID at airport security and have treats handy to make sure my dog has motivation to be on her best behavior. And don’t get me started on the two handles, one that’s closer to me and one closer to my dog. The one that’s closer to me is great when my dog pulls and takes the pressure away from my back. I also love how there is a handle closer to my dog so I can better “control” her pulling when in tight situations (such as the airport). Finally, I’m very happy with the versatility of this leash, allowing me to adjust it so I can wear it as a cross body or a belt.Great purchase for any dog parent especially the ones whose dogs like to dictate which direction we walk in and is a master at pulling.

Put it on like a fanny pack(which it kinda is)with a poop bag dispenser.

Heavy, short, not flexible
Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2023Color: Black/TealVerified Purchase
Of zero use for a 50-lb dog because it’s short, uncomfortable, heavy, and inflexible. Absolutely does not extend to any length beyond its shortest without a lot of pull. Leash can somehow pull me enough to hurt my back, especially due to the lack of flexibility. Does not trigger her training collar whatsoever. Only a large dog at high constant velocity could actually make this leash bungee. My dog just pulls hard enough to annoy me and then gets tangled on it. Also, the belt is not comfortable for a smallish waist. It completely has to double for my waist, which is annoying to adjust every time. And my dog is a pit bull mix. If you usually use an extendable leash, this will not take its place for most dogs. My dog’s neck is 18 inches. She can pull some weight. I can’t even use this for a back up. Everything is black, hard to see, hard to use, and heavy and stiff. Useless. Can’t get the fanny pack on right side up either and it zips halfway down so things will fall out.

So good I bought it twice!
Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024Verified Purchase
Works great and gives me piece of mind that my dog’s leash won’t be slipping out of my hand. Great for when I’m jogging. We also used the double ended leash to attach her harness to the car’s seat as a seatbelt. We wrap it around so it’s just long enough for her to lay down but not long enough to get tangled in. We used it so much. It’s been about four or five years. Then we brought it to the beach and the sand clogged it up and the clips got a bit harder to open. I decided to just order a new one because I had lost the fanny pack while moving. Best purchase ever!

Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024Size: 14 Count (Pack of 1)Pattern Name: RazorsVerified Purchase
Figured I'd try out some options. I dusted off my safety razor and ordered an Amazon basics razor.I'd love to use the old fashioned safety razor that is my grandfather's 50s Gillett razor. Cool factor is off the charts. But after getting some top rated blades for it, I used it once and gave up. You have to go over the area 6 or so times to get a close shave. And it will leave nicks every time.The Amazon razor I could not use. It pulls on the hair instead of cutting it. Out of curiosity, i took a dry swipe with the Amazon and it was unbearable. Felt like waxing. Then I did a dry swipe with an old Harry's blade that should probably be changed. It was silky smooth and cut right through the hair despite its condition.Curious, I took a magnifying glass to the Amazon and Harry's blades. Harry's blades are precisely spaced and look new to me. The Amazon blades looked worse even though they were new. The blades were not evenly spaced and just looked lower quality.Now I'm Harry's for life. I'm sold.

I recently purchased the ErgoPro Ergonomic Office Chair, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every aspect.Assembly was a breeze; I had the chair up and running in no time. What impressed me the most was the simplicity of it all. With just one tool provided in the package, I was able to put the chair together effortlessly. It was a relief to find that extra screws were included, just in case.Comfort is paramount when it comes to office chairs, and the ErgoPro delivers on that front. The design provides excellent lumbar support, and the seat cushion is plush yet supportive. Adjusting the chair to my preferred settings was a cinch, thanks to its intuitive controls. Whether it's altering the height, tilt, or armrest position, the ErgoPro makes customization a breeze.The materials used in the construction of this chair are top-notch. Sturdy, strong, and durable, I can tell this chair will stand the test of time. From the base to the upholstery, everything feels of high quality and built to last.One standout feature for me is the blade wheels. Not only do they look sleek, but they also glide effortlessly across various surfaces. The smooth rolling action was a significant factor in my decision to purchase this chair, and I'm delighted with how well they perform.In conclusion, the ErgoPro Ergonomic Office Chair offers exceptional value for the money. With easy assembly, superior comfort, durable materials, and smooth blade wheels, it's a wise investment for anyone in need of a reliable office chair.

Tell you what - this chair has been amazing so far. I bought it as an upgrade from my previous chair I had for almost 7 years. I was looking for a chair that had plenty of lower back support, comfortable seating and rollerblade wheels. Well, this chair checked all of the boxes and a few more. It looks amazing, was easy to assemble and the build quality is excellent. Also, the armrests are customizeable and the actual arms are made of metal (not plastic). I'll need to see how it holds up to daily use, but so far so good!

Perfect! Except for...
Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2021Color: BlackVerified Purchase
First of all, I'm 5'6"", 180lbs for reference. I use this chair fully compressed downward and it's just the right height. There's a good 4-6 inches of upward travel on the piston so I'm sure taller people will find this chair equally as comfortable.What I love about this chair: the form is such that when locked upright, it almost reminds you to maintain your posture. This has been great for my lower back and longevity throughout the day. The lumbar has just the right amount of give. Other reviews have mentioned a straight across bar that makes the chair uncomfortable... I have no idea what they're talking about. If it's the framework of the chair, I question just exactly how they're trying to sit in it. I'm comfy in this chair for hours on end. Another point is the mesh fabric. I've read some reviews that it's too rough... and it might be the case if you go through your work day completely naked, so fair enough. I, however, find it to have slightly grippy quality that's great for maintaining a good position in the chair. It's pretty solidly built, and looks great. There's three locking positions on the tilt. Straight up, perfect for productivity. Midway, which suits me great for kicking my feet up with my dog ony lap. And full back, a setting I've come to call ""nap time."" Also the other stuff everyone wants to know: Shipping was quick, it was packed with care, and I assembled in about 15 minutes after I had it all laid out. Directions are pretty straightforward.What I dont like: I said earlier the lumbar has just the right amount of give. This is a bit subjective and I would love it even more if it were lockable or otherwise adjustable rather than just spring loaded... a feature I found in a few other chairs in the same price point. The armrest pads have a lot of give in their detents. There's no wobble of the arm rests themselves, just the pads/platforms. They could stand to be tightened up a bit. Then the headrest. Yes, its super comfy, and you can adjust the height. However, its vertical rotation has no ratcheting action. Its just loose, so you will find yourself twisting it often to meet your head correctly. Also, I mentioned before that at it's lowest, its a perfect fit for me. Nevertheless, I feel it could go just a touch lower like most of my previous chairs so it could fit under my keyboard tray-equipped desk. For those reasons, she slipped to a 4-star review.Overall, if you're looking for a quality chair, this could very well be your guy. No regerts here with my purchase... and I did a LOT of research in the $250-$350 price point.

Very stylish and comfortable chair
Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2024Color: BlackVerified Purchase
First this is a super stylish office chair. The pattern on it is dope. Just about every part of this chair is adjustable. The arms lower and lift, moves forward and back. The head rest lowers and lifts as well. It feels so comfy right in the curve of my neck. The lumbar support adjusts and it is super comfy as is. The seat moves forward and back if needed. Then the whole chair lowers and lifts altogether. It’s high enough that I can work on my counter top table or low enough to work at the desk comfortably. I like the bouncy spring like action of the mesh chair. This chair is great for larger and taller people. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow. Definitely worth the price.

Cozy Nights In with the Sauna Blanket
Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
Having this infrared sauna blanket has made my evenings surprisingly more relaxing. It feels like a little escape without leaving the house. What I find quite handy is the touch screen controls. They're really easy to get the hang of, letting me adjust the heat from 113-176℉ without any hassle, depending on how chilly it is that evening or how much I feel like unwinding. The timer option is practical too, with settings from 30 to 60 minutes so I can just chill without keeping an eye on the clock. It's pretty spacious at 6 ft long, enough room to stretch out, yet it doesn't take up too much space when I store it away. The warmth is just lovely, not just for relaxation but it’s supposed to be good for detoxing too. It's also lightweight enough that moving it around isn't a big deal, which means I can change my relaxation spot whenever I want. For the price, it's been a wonderful way for me to add a bit of self-care into my routine, especially on those evenings when the kids have finally settled down and I have some time to myself.

Cozy Experience
Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
I got myself an infrared sauna blanket mainly because I've heard it's pretty good for your health, especially for someone like me who struggles to keep up with regular gym visits. The idea of detoxing and relaxing at home seemed appealing, I'm a gaming enthusiast, so being able to game while taking care of my health sounded perfect.It's convenient to use. The length of the blanket is just right, allowing me to take my hands out so I can sit on the couch and play games while sweating out toxins. The operation is straightforward with a small control screen where you can adjust the time and temperature. I'm quite satisfied with it because it meets my expectations, making me feel refreshed after each use. Cleaning it is a breeze too; just unzip, clean, and hang to dry. When not in use, it can be rolled up for storage without taking up much space, which is perfect for me.

My Sauna Blanket Experience
Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
I got myself this Sauna Blanket because of the high stress from work. After a long day, I always look for ways to relax without stepping out of my house. Using this sauna blanket is super convenient, especially after a busy day. All I need to do is sit on my bed, turn on the TV, and enjoy the sauna vibes. This is way more comfortable than going to a sauna facility. I've been to sauna rooms a few times before, but I always found the air there made it hard to breathe comfortably. With this sauna blanket, I don’t face that issue. The touch screen makes it easy to use, and it’s also easy to clean. After each session, I take a shower, and the feeling afterwards is amazing. It feels like all the toxins are flushed out, leaving my body feeling refreshed and clear.

I have taken 1 shower and I already know this product has changed my life. For the first time I feel like my hair is CLEAN. It was so easy to install, took only 30 seconds. I have very long, fine hair and a lot of it and I always struggle with grease and product build up. Now I'm wondering if I have just been struggling with hard water all my life. Hoping this product will reduce hair loss but I will have to come back and update in a few weeks for that.My skin feels less slimy and softer plus, I dried off really fast. Not sure if there is a reason that but I wouldn't be surprised if it was connected. Price did not bother me considering this life changing experience. This is my first filtering shower head so I cannot compare it to other products on the market.I was pleasantly surprised by the water pressure. I had spent an equal price on my previous shower head (not filtered) and the Jolie is better. It does come with a piece to reduce the flow for certain states but thank goodness it's not the state I live in. Box it came in was very well done and I appreciated the cute little wrench! Sending this link to all my friends and my mom. Cant wait for the hubby to try.

Wow I can feel the difference in my skin. This shower head is amazing. When I first got it I was skeptical that one shower head setting wasn’t going to be enough for me. However it seems to be truly perfect. The one thing I would say is that I do not think the filters last 3 months like they say. We bought the black shower head and it’s been 2 months and I can see the white water marks which I would think would be eliminated with the filter.

The water pressure is great. Very easy to instal, includes tools needed for instal which make it easy. I trust that it is doing a good job filtering, however, I haven’t noticed any difference in hair or skin like it was advertised.

Two Uses and my Hair and Skin is SO MUCH BETTED
Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2024Color: Brushed SteelVerified Purchase
Okay, the price really scared me on this one at first, not gonna lie. Do I think it needs to be this expensive… no. Is it gonna do the job it claims immediately and make your water soft, clean, and healthy…yes!!! I didn’t want to spend money on another product, but I live in an old apartment building and deal with 5-6 months of very cold, dry season, and I like a hot shower. I have always had amazing full healthy hair, and within 8 months of living at this place, my hair has become dry, limp and not able to absorb products. I was thinking my products were the problem, but once I figured out the water was chlorinated and full of old minerals, I realized I was spending money on products that weren’t gonna do their job due to the water. I’m two washes in and my hair and skin is on track to getting back to normal. If you’re tired of complaining to your friends and self about how your hair has deteriorated, this is a solution. My water pressure is even better too!

Mixer Review 2YRS In The Making + TIPS!!!!
Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2015Color: Ice BluePattern Name: MixerVerified Purchase
4.5 STARS. As always, I prefer to give credit where credit is due rather than short change a product, but just keep in mind there are a few drawbacks to this mixer.  But first the pros, this sucker is STURDY! Most of us have seen these mixers everywhere for what seems to be decades, but it was probably just me that didn't realize all kitchenmaid stand mixers aren't created equal.  While they may look alike, different models have different capacities, speeds and effectiveness in various applications.  I really wanted to wait to write this review until I had really explored this machine because it's such a big investment (in my opinion at least!).  Now that I have, the sturdiness of this product has definitely proven to be true.  We have a rather small kitchen and so it gets moved around quite a bit, this hasn't resulted in any sort of loosening or wiggling which is important when you have that dough hook running at top speed (some of the cheaper mixers act like poorly balanced washing machines).  The sturdiness, however, can be a double edged sword due to the heft.  If you have trouble lifting things or perhaps a bit of arthritis be sure to store this on a mobile kitchen cart or simply give it a permanent countertop space to avoid having to lift it from a bottom (or worse-top) cabinet which can be a task.  Next is function, I cannot tell you how nice it is to be able to toss something into this mixer and walk away to get the other ingredients without having to babysit a bowl! Especially when I'm working with something dense like honey or doughs. The attachments have all been easy to put on/take off and are sized well enough to store away easily.  There is room for improvement though, the rubber spatula sided mixer attachment is sold separately which is what can scrape down the sides of your bowl without you having to angle a separate spatula into the mixer, I would have been open to forgoing some of the other attachments in order to have this one right off the bat, but they are cheaper and easy to find at TJ Maxx, Marshalls, etc..  Also, the swing back mechanism for the top of the mixer via the hinge at the neck has no protection against it flipping up and down hard.  Think about the drawer add-ons you can install so they don't slam, that would be great for the head of this mixer, just to protect the hinge. Color-wise, the blue color of this mixer is absolutely dreamy! It's beautiful and a bit novel without being overly kitschy and is still easy to match to other kitchen products out there.  Overall, I really do love this piece of equipment and think it is a great investment for anyone who likes to cook or bake. This model and size is great for families and even sturdy enough to teach the little ones on. Half star loss for the lack of slow-down mechanism for the head and the lack of spatula on the mixer attachment leaving you to clean up the walls of the bowl pretty frequently, but apart from that this machine is fantastic.PROS: Built To Last, BEAUTIFUL color, Easy On/Off Attachments, Does Not Slow Down When Dealing With Thick/Difficult Foods (i.e. Honey, Doughs, etc.), Great Size, Good Investment Piece (I bought this two years ago and the price hasn't fallen).CONS: No Cushion For Mixer Head When Lifting up/Down To Prevent Hard Slam, Spatula Mixer Attachment Not Included Requiring You to Scrape Down The Bowl Pretty Often, Expensive (but again, it's not bad for an investment piece-I can't see this thing breaking any time soon or ever maybe)TIPS: TJ Maxx and Marshalls have attachment for these mixers on sale regularly for 60% off the selling price so if you have one nearby go and check for that spatula attachment or even a pasta maker or meat grinder I've seen them all there!, If you are working with dough (or especially if a young one is learning) watch out for it coiling up your dough hook and into the gears-it can happen quickly if you're not careful.  Last, I've found that a metal blemish extractor (bought and dedicated for mixer cleaning) is the best tool to get into the attachment holder and metal pieces in the head of the mixer in case they get dirty (or gunked up with aforementioned dough... ).  It is sturdier than a toothpick which runs the risk of breaking and getting caught in the gears.***Did you find my review helpful? I hope so!

It’s definitely an investment but we received ours as a gift for our wedding. If you’re someone who likes cooking and baking this is a must-have! Maybe not actually but it cuts the work time in half and is so convenient. I use mine to make baked goods but also for things like mashed potatoes… just trust me! It’s well made, beautiful, and convenient! The stainless bowl is easy to clean and so are the attachments it comes with. We also received the pasta maker attachment and it works just as well! Get it!

EXTREMELY SATISIFIED WITH THIS MIXER.
Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2012Color: Imperial GrayPattern Name: MixerVerified Purchase
I've been using KitchenAid products for years now and to be frank, have not been dissatisfied with one of them.  The 5 Quart Artisan 325 volt model being reviewed here is no exception. We have quite a few friends and relatives who use this same model and without exception all are delighted with this machine.  It is dependable, reliable, mixes well and we personally have had no problems with ours what-so-ever.  It does the job we pay it to do and does it well.  Our mixer goes through very frequent and heavy duty use.Now there are a couple of things to note here:First, this machine is quite heavy.  This puppy weighs 22 pounds without the attachment and full mixing bowl.  This is not an appliance you can easily move from place to place in the kitchen.  Along the same line, this is not a small machine my any means.  It does indeed need at least 1 square foot of working space.  It should also be noted that when the head is tilted back, it adds another approximate 3 inches to the height.  This is important if you have cabinets built in over your counter top you work at.  We are fortunate to have a built in specialty bake center in our kitchen which has been designed to accommodate appliances such as this.Second, I cannot emphasis enough the need to thoroughly read and reread the instructions that come with this mixer!  I read the majority of reviews on this mixer and I note that a goodly number of the negative reviews stem from the fact that the instructions had not been read.  Please refer to the number one review here by Kathleen.  She gives a wonderful procedure for adjusting the mixing tool using a dime as a measurement device while adjusting the mixing functions.  She is spot on and here method she shares works!  In addition, we have found that the service department at KitchenAid to be extremely helpful, not only for this product, but others also.Third, there seems to be a raging argument going on here as to whether or not this is an American made product.  This mixed has ""Made In America"" stamped all over it.  The assembly plant is located in Greenville, Ohio.  Now I have no doubt what so ever that many of the ""parts"" to this machine are indeed made in other countries, China being the primary source.  Folks who read my reviews will know that I am something of a fanatic (Actually, you could say I am sort of possessed) as to buying products made only in the U.S. when ever possible.  But on the same note, I am also rather pragmatic and a bit of a realist.  I would strongly suspect that right now, if everything in your home and care that had parts made in another country would suddenly vanish, you would end up without one electronic or motor driven device that worked and you home would be a pile of rubble.  I don't like this but have to accept the fact that that is just the way it is.Fifth, every now and then you will indeed run across a ""lemon"" with any manufactured product.  I note in the reviews here that this has obviously happened to some folks with this particular machine.  On the other hand the vast majority of reviewers here have had no problems (me included).  To be honest, that is one of several reasons I ordered this mixer from Amazon - if I should have happened to have received one of these ""lemons"" I feel very comfortable with Amazon's return policy.  I have used this policy before and have found it to be efficient and hassle free.Sixth, I note that the vast majority of negative reviews on this product date back several years. I note that the vast majority of newer reviews are all favorable.  Perhaps KitchenAid was having problems at one time in the past.  As far as the machine setting in our bake center as I write this, I have absolutely no complaints and am delighted.Seventh, I note that a number of the more negative reviews here reference machines that do not have the 325 Watt motor.  I am not sure of the reason for this but I hardly think that a mixer with a smaller motor should be compared to this machine.  Power makes a difference in this sort of appliance.Eighth,  I note that many have compared this product to that of Hobart.  Folks, I have no doubt what so ever that Hobart is probably a better machine.  On the other hand I do not have the inclination or need for a mixer that runs into thousands of dollars.  Granted, I am cheap, I admit that, but I simply cannot justify the cost of one of the high priced ""professional"" machines.Clean-up for this mixer is extremely easy.  As I am the chief cleaner-upper in our household, this is important to me.  The machine is quite simple to use - simple to the point that a small child could quite easily use it with minimal directions.  This is an extremely attractive appliance and if we did not have an enclosed bake center, we would not hesitate to have this one setting on our counter top.Bottom line is that we are completely happy with this product.  It does the job we paid for it to do.  Others quite well may have had bad experiences with it, but ours have been all positive.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks

Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2024Style: Cicaplast Hand CreamVerified Purchase
My hands are always dry, no matter what lotion I've tried.  Until I tried this wonderful hand cream, I never got lasting relief from any lotion or hand cream.  The La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Hand Cream absorbs quickly, leaving a velvety moisturized feeling and instant relief for my very dry hands.  It is unscented, which I like.  Best of all, its wonderful moisturizing effects last 24 hours or more, even with frequent hand washing and no additional applications of this hand cream.  I just use a small amount of this hand cream in the evening, and my hands feel great for at least a day or so.  I highly recommend this very effective product to anyone who has struggled to find a hand cream that actually works.

I started to get really dry skin on my hands knuckles and fingers this winter and my hands were starting to look really rough!. For weeks I tried so many different creams and nothing was helping until I came across this gem! This cream started to work almost instantly! Not only did it help repair my skin but it’s actually making my hands look younger!! I’m using this for life, I actually ordered a few more to keep in my car, purse, etc. I also love that it’s not greasy and absorbs quickly. Honestly, it’s the best hand cream out there and half the price of some other brands that aren’t even as effective!

My hands get very dry as soon as the weather gets cold. Gloves don’t help. I’ve tried so many hand creams which either don’t work well or actually make it worse.  La Roche-Posay is a company I’m familiar with so I thought I’d try their hand cream. So glad I did. This works so well and is fragrance free. It seemed a little thick and slightly greasy but not so. A little goes a long way. It absorbs into the skin quickly and is so soothing even through several hand washings. I’ll definitely buy this again.

A Breathtaking Blooming Beauty: The LEGO Bonsai Tree!
Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2023Verified Purchase
I recently treated myself to the LEGO Bonsai Tree set, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations! As an avid LEGO enthusiast and a lover of nature, this kit beautifully combines the best of both worlds, allowing me to build and display a stunning piece of art that adds a touch of serenity to my living space.First and foremost, the level of detail in this set is mind-blowing. The intricate branches, the delicate cherry blossom blooms, and the meticulously designed base - every aspect has been thoughtfully crafted to resemble a real bonsai tree. The use of different shades of green and pink bricks for the foliage adds a natural and lifelike feel to the tree, making it a truly captivating centerpiece.The building process itself was an absolute pleasure. LEGO's clear and well-illustrated instructions made assembling the bonsai tree a breeze. Additionally, the set comes with an alternate set of pink blossoms, allowing me to switch between a springtime bloom and a more subtle green leafy look. The versatility of the design is a fantastic feature that lets me tailor the tree to my mood and the changing seasons.Once completed, the LEGO Bonsai Tree became an eye-catching conversation starter in my home. Its presence is both calming and charming, and it brings a sense of tranquility to any room. Whether placed on a bookshelf, a coffee table, or even as a centerpiece for a dining table, it adds a touch of elegance and a splash of color to the surroundings.What I love most about this LEGO set is its ability to offer a meditative building experience. As I carefully assembled each piece, I found myself completely immersed in the process, and it provided a much-needed escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. It's not just a LEGO set; it's a therapeutic creative journey that brings joy and fulfillment.Lastly, I appreciate LEGO's commitment to sustainability. The set includes plant-based elements, which aligns perfectly with my values as an environmentally conscious individual. Kudos to LEGO for taking steps toward a greener future!In conclusion, the LEGO Bonsai Tree is a delightful masterpiece that brings nature and creativity together in a harmonious and rewarding way. Its aesthetic appeal, coupled with the joy of building, makes it an exceptional addition to any LEGO collection or a perfect gift for nature lovers and LEGO enthusiasts alike. I can't recommend this set enough - it's a definite must-have!

As expected, they work well.
Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2024Color: Black/WhiteVerified Purchase
Samsung SmartTag2 is easy to set up and use. The tags utilize low energy Bluetooth to connect to other Samsung Galaxy devices in the immediate area in order to update the location.I've been evaluating 4 SmartTag2s for over a week now by passing them out to willing family members and monitoring their ability to update their location in the wild. So far, they all have performed well. Tracking is not constant as it would be with GPS but whenever the tags are within pinging distance of a Galaxy device, they will update. The updated location is not necessarily the location of the tag itself but rather the Galaxy device that it was able to connect with which in theory should put you within a radius that would allow a local search using the SmartThings app. The SmartThings app integrates with Google Maps and allows navigation to the tags location if needed. While in motion the tags appear to update more frequently and sometimes send pings every 2 minutes or so but while stationary, they ping less often. There have been periods where a tag might not update for hours but I know that location has no Galaxy devices on site.  Setup is straight forward and there are no other fees or charges associated with using the tags. Can't really speak on battery life as I've owned them for a week. So far, I myself nor any members of my family have experienced any random tones or beeps from any of the tags.

A Smart Tracker Marvel with Minor Sound Caveats
Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I recently acquired the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2, and it has proven to be an exceptional addition to my tech arsenal. Here's a detailed breakdown of my experience:Ease of Setup: 5/5Setting up the SmartTag2 was a breeze. Within minutes, I had it seamlessly connected to my phone. The user-friendly setup process makes it an excellent choice for both tech-savvy users and beginners.Price: 5/5The pricing for this tracker is reasonable, especially considering the absence of monthly subscriptions that some other brands impose. It offers great value for those looking for an efficient tracking solution without breaking the bank.Smart Features: 5/5The SmartTag2's smart features are a game-changer. With three programmable buttons, I can easily locate my phone with a double tap. The other two buttons are customizable – I use one to control my smart lights, ensuring a well-lit home upon my arrival, and the other to send a quick message to my wife, notifying her that I'm on my way home.Sound: 3/5While the SmartTag2's sound feature is functional, it's not particularly loud. In crowded environments, it may pose challenges in locating the tracker. However, in more confined spaces like my home, it works decently when I misplace my keys.Reliability: 5/5So far, I've been extremely happy with the reliability of finding lost items using the SmartTag2. I use it on my keys, and I receive a notification when my phone gets too far from the tag. Remarkably, even when I go to get my mail from my mailbox, it regularly notifies my phone that the tag has left the area. Additionally, the tag can ring my phone when I misplace it.Overall Impression:The Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 has been a reliable and innovative companion. Its ease of setup, affordable pricing, and versatile smart features make it a top-notch choice for anyone seeking an efficient tracking solution without the hassle of monthly subscriptions.

Work well for finding keys...
Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2024Color: Black/WhiteVerified Purchase
I bought these to track items that I attach the tags to and for that purpose it works very well.This generation of SmartTags also have other features that use the button built into the tag. I have tried to use that feature to connect to my smartthings and control some lighting around the house. This feature does work but it is just not that reliable. Also using the long press to locate my phone is iffy. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't do anything.For the purpose I bought them for I would give it 5 stars but I am deducting one star because the other features are hit or miss.

it just works.
Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2024Color: BlackVerified Purchase
bought it not expecting much. it doesn't work very well if the tag is in constant movement, but when the tag stays in a place for a few minutes, it usually sends the location signal. works better in a heavily populated area, since it relies on other samsung phones to relay the signal.  my wife took it with her to work and I was able to track her location with good accuracy while she was on public transport. will be using it to track our vehicles in case they get stolen.  very good for tracking pets and elderly parents / grandparents who like to wander.  have not tested the battery duration yet since I've had it for less than 1 month.

Works ok so far.  Has annoying beep beeps
Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023Color: Black/WhiteVerified Purchase
I got these for the sole purpose of tracking stolen items(ATVs, Tractors, etc...).  They actually work fairly well.The one detractor I've found so far is they have an annoying/obnoxious BEEP sound that seems to happen any time the button is depressed(like if its on a keyring in your pocket), or when one is separated from your phone.  That beeping sound CANT be disabled in the software and from what I can gather Samsung has no intention of adding a mute option.  These wont be purchased again...Kind of defeats the purpose if you plan on burying these things in something that you want to track without the thieves knowing its there...The obnoxious beep is almost enough for me to want to switch to the even more annoying fruit product.  I absolutely despise anything that has some sort of beeping that cant be disabled.  What idiot thinks that's a good idea?  ""Lets just make a bunch of beeping and no way for the user to disable it without cutting it open, voiding the warranty, and breaking solder joints."".

***THIS IS NOT A DUPE!  This is the real bag! It’s sold by Zappos. Only writing this because I know some people may have doubts due to occasional sale. ***Real review:LISTEN! Get this stupid tote! I get it. The branding maybe a little too “in your face” but even if that’s not your thing, get this dumb bag. I decided to use it as my everyday/baby bag and yeah. I am literally in love with it. I definitely got influenced by some videos out there but was hesistant on it due to the fact that it SAYS it’s a tote bag, but goodness gracious. This bag is amazing and everything fits in it. And the fact is has a zipper is even better. I will say, I hate that the strap is so simple but you can switch it out (there’s plenty of options in the brand) and personalize it a little more. All that to say, if you’re hesitant but need a bag that is useful AND trendy, get it!

Not quite awesome-color faded within months
Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2023Verified Purchase
I bought this handbag for my daughter’s 17th birthday gift. We absolutely loved the bag!! Her birthday was March 15th and she’s been wearing the bag a lot. Literally 3 months later we’ve noticed that her bag’s “black” canvas fabric has faded drastically. It’s literally dark brown now with a black strap. I don’t understand how a $200 (plus) bag can depreciate in quality after only 3 months. Needless to say, I was worried and didn’t want my daughter to NOT love her bag anymore because of the “fading “ so of course I did what every mother would and searched and read every review imaginable for this tote. After reading a dozen reviews or so, I thankfully exhaled after reading that the canvas material has a natural fading effect that it happens to go through and there isn’t much to change it. I am happy to say that my daughter (I mean we)are still I love with the tote!! I have 2 more daughters to buy birthday gifts for and this Marc Jacobs’ tote may be considered for one of them and possibly a Christmas gift for the other…🥰

I have owned this ring for literally just a month and almost immediately you could see the finish begin to fade and wear.  It is now no longer gold color anywhere at all and even much of the silver color is worn away to whatever copperish color metal the ring is made from.  I really like the contour shape and scale of the ring. It may be ok for wearing a couple hours for an occasion or two. Unfortunately, the finish does not hold up to much at all.  My ring is beginning to look pretty unsightly at this point and I’ll soon need to discard it.  Whatever the ring is made of has not turned my finger green or caused a sensitivity reaction though.

Invigorating Hair Care Essential: Mielle Organics Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil Review
Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2024Verified Purchase
Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil is a revitalizing elixir that has quickly become a staple in my hair care routine. As someone who values natural ingredients and effective results, I've found this oil to be a game-changer for promoting healthy hair and scalp.First and foremost, let's talk about ingredients. This oil is enriched with a nourishing blend of natural oils, including rosemary, mint, and coconut, known for their rejuvenating and strengthening properties. These botanical extracts work synergistically to hydrate and nourish the scalp, stimulate hair growth, and fortify strands from root to tip. The lightweight formula absorbs quickly into the scalp and hair, leaving behind a refreshing and invigorating scent that awakens the senses.One of the standout features of the Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil is its versatility. Whether you have curly, coily, or straight hair, this oil is suitable for all hair types and textures. Whether used as a scalp treatment, pre-shampoo treatment, or leave-in conditioner, it delivers consistent results, leaving hair feeling softer, stronger, and more manageable with each use.In terms of performance, this oil excels at its primary task: promoting scalp health and hair growth. The combination of rosemary and mint oils helps to improve circulation to the scalp, stimulate hair follicles, and reduce scalp irritation and inflammation. With regular use, I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall health and appearance of my hair, including reduced shedding, increased shine, and enhanced manageability.Design-wise, the packaging of the Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil is both practical and aesthetically pleasing. The compact 2-ounce bottle is perfect for travel or on-the-go touch-ups, while the convenient dropper applicator ensures precise and mess-free dispensing. Additionally, the dark glass bottle helps to preserve the potency of the oil by protecting it from light and oxidation.While the Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil offers exceptional performance and value, there are a few minor considerations to keep in mind. Some users may find the minty scent to be quite strong, especially if they are sensitive to fragrances. However, I personally enjoy the refreshing aroma, which leaves my hair smelling clean and invigorated throughout the day.Overall, I highly recommend the Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil to anyone looking to promote scalp health and achieve stronger, more vibrant hair. With its nourishing ingredients, versatile application, and refreshing scent, this oil is sure to become a beloved addition to your hair care routine. Say hello to healthier, happier hair with Mielle Organics.

Love the smell
Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2024Verified Purchase
I got this because I had some thinning along my hair line and wanted my many ""baby hairs"" to stop sticking up all over the place and needed something to help them grow. It's only been a month in, but I can already tell it is working. What I do is every night when I am doing my nightly routine washing my face/brushing teeth I first wash my face/get all my makeup off, and once I have used my cleanser then washed off I use this. I use this before putting my toner and serums on. I apply it all along the hairline and since this bottle comes with a dropper, it makes it precise and helps it not go everywhere. After I apply a few drops all along my hairline on my forehead I gently rub it in with my fingertips and then take a brow brush or brow spool and brush it in and back like im going to put my hair in a ponytail. I let that sit for about 20 minutes then wash it off with water. This is particularly good on nights if you use or apply masks or skin treatments, because you have to let the mask sit for a certain amount of time so doing this with it helps take care of both at once. I have also started to use this on my eyebrows as well to help with over plucking so I can grow my eyebrows back in and its really actually working! I have been trying so long to try and get my sparse hairs to grow in and full and nothing has worked but this stuff. I take a few drops and put it on each brow and rub it in the brow line then take a brow spooling and brush it in. Wait about 15 to 20 minutes then wash out with water then your done. The key is consistency and this will work. The smell is like a cleaner version of like a  Vicks Vapor rub, but not super strong. I love using this stuff at night because it opens up my nasal passages before bed. This product comes in a glass jar with a glass dropper and rubber dropper head. This stuff really works! This stuff has done so good so far I can't wait to see what a few more months will do. Next I am going to start trying this stuff in my hair for split ends and I have full faith they are going to start looking fabulous 👌Update** I'm so mad at myself, because I wish I would've taken a before picture to put with progress photos to show how much this has had an effect on my hair growth! This is doing great for my hairline, but I noticed alot of the reviews on this was for baby hairs and for regular hair growth, so I wanted to put forth some info on if and how well this does for other areas such as eyebrows, and let me tell you, this stuff is absolutely AMAZING for that! The photos above are my eyebrows at about 3 to 3 and 1/2 weeks in using this product. I only had hair where the inside of the green boxes are, and honestly the picture doesn't do it justice, because this product helped fill in those areas too. All the outside of the green boxes is from using this product. I cant believe what I'm seeing grow, it's amazing :) The picture with my lashes is to show where I apply this along my lash line where the green line is. Those are my natural lashes with nothing on them and this stuff has made them full and longer. (I do not apply the dropper itself along the lash line, after applying to my eyebrows and hair line when rubbing the product in I use what is left on my finger and swipe gently along the lash line.) I will update again to post another photo of what it looks like once I get to the 2 and 1/2 to 3 month mark.

Invigorating Care: Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil Review
Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2024Verified Purchase
Embarking on a journey to fortify his hair, my husband has embraced Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil. Initial impressions are positive, with the oil demonstrating commendable performance. Its revitalizing blend leaves a refreshing sensation on the scalp, infusing each strand with invigorating nourishment.However, its slight stickiness post-application poses a minor inconvenience, remedied by pairing it with a hair serum for seamless distribution. Nonetheless, for nighttime rituals, direct application proves sufficient for scalp rejuvenation. As we tread further along this hair care odyssey, the ultimate test remains: its efficacy in combatting thinning hair. Time will unfold its true potential. For now, we traverse with optimism, buoyed by the promising start and the aromatic allure of this hair tonic.In summary, Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil emerges as a compelling contender in the battle against hair woes, promising revitalization and strength with each use.

Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I’ve been waiting to write a review on this product because I wanted to give it some time to see if I actually would get results, and after two months of using this product, I do! I use this product twice a week and leave it in my hair for 1-2 hours before washing it out. I section my hair and oil in between the sections and massage in a circular motion. I few drops goes a long way! I over it did it my first time and I looked like an oil slick. I also make sure to get my ends and once I’m done I put my hair in a clip and let it rest. Even my hair dresser notice a difference in my hair the last time I saw her. She noticed my hair looked healthier and a little fuller. I would recommend trying it out, but remember a little goes a long way.

Fun design, decent instructions, not great yarn
Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2024Color: Question BlockVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )Verified Purchase
We got the ""Question Block"" kit for obvious reasons.The design is cute and while I see other people saying they only got a QR code for their projects pointing to video, we got that plus a little ""tips"" pamphlet and a more detailed instruction booklet that includes a section of abbreviations as well as fairly detailed instructions with lots of photos for various steps.Despite these instructions and the videos and what seemed like a simple design, we were having a lot of trouble with this. Turns out, it was the yarn which frays pretty easily. Switching over to store bought yarn, this all worked out a lot better.It's a shame because basic yarn is pretty cheap and to have the yarn be kind of the point of failure in a kit that comes with everything and pretty good instructions is a shame.For the price of this kit which was almost twice as much as a couple of others we ordered after from a different seller after that came with better yarn (although less fun packaging) it's kind of a shame.Still, to get the pattern, the instructions and the basic tools (and know you've got all the tools you need) it's still workable. Just plan on picking up your own yellow and white yarn to make life easier.

The yarn is super cheap and is splitting making it hard. I’ve given up on it and will probably donate the kit!Also it comes with 2 hooks that are the same size (2.5) why would I need 2 the same size?You’re better off buying yarn at the local craft store and then buying a pattern off Etsy!Also missing the stuffing! So for $20 I bought a bag of cheap yarn, stitch holders and 2 hooks 👎🏼

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 These designs are super cute! The kit contains everything you’ll need to make 4 complete projects, and then some. It even includes stitch markers, yarn needle, 2 hooks (too small for the yarn IMHO), wire (for the stems), scissors and a glue stick (but no glue gun).The instruction booklets are well written, which surprised me. There is a beginner’s guide book which covers vocabulary and a how-to for each stitch needed to make these projects. The videos echo the booklets and are very thorough. If you can understand the slight accent, you’re golden.And that’s where my compliments end. The yarn is akin to synthetic embroidery yarn - splits and unravels SUPER easy and would be incredibly frustrating for a beginner. The Guide Page says it’s cotton yarn. I looked at the Amazon listing and it doesn’t mention the fiber content, so I can’t really complain. It is most definitely NOT cotton. Cotton, when burned, should turn to ash. This melted - rather quickly, too - watch me almost burn my fingers! It’s thinner than the worsted weight yarn I purchased for another amigurimi project.

            These designs are super cute! The kit contains everything you’ll need to make 4 complete projects, and then some. It even includes stitch markers, yarn needle, 2 hooks (too small for the yarn IMHO), wire (for the stems), scissors and a glue stick (but no glue gun).The instruction booklets are well written, which surprised me. There is a beginner’s guide book which covers vocabulary and a how-to for each stitch needed to make these projects. The videos echo the booklets and are very thorough. If you can understand the slight accent, you’re golden.And that’s where my compliments end. The yarn is akin to synthetic embroidery yarn - splits and unravels SUPER easy and would be incredibly frustrating for a beginner. The Guide Page says it’s cotton yarn. I looked at the Amazon listing and it doesn’t mention the fiber content, so I can’t really complain. It is most definitely NOT cotton. Cotton, when burned, should turn to ash. This melted - rather quickly, too - watch me almost burn my fingers! It’s thinner than the worsted weight yarn I purchased for another amigurimi project. I think the hooks provided are too small for the yarn. My stitches were so tight and tiny, I couldn’t see where I was supposed to insert my hook. I picked up my 3.5mm hook and started the project (I’ll try to upload a finished project picture/video, if I ever finish).As an advanced beginner/intermediate crocheter, I can do this project but it is not as easy as it should be.

NOT for Beginners
Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2023Color: 4 Plants FamilyVerified Purchase
I got this after seeing those ads for woobles beginner kits everywhere but thought the woobles were a bit pricey so thought this kit was a steal. I realize now I should have just gotten the woobles kit. The yarn in this kit splits so easily it took me forever to figure out how to hook it for even the basic stitch without it all unraveling and pulling apart, rendering it useless. I watched the videos a million times but could not figure out the magic loop stitch which is definitely not beginner friendly (in the woobles kit they have it prestarted for you and use special yarn that can't be split). I was starting to become convinced I must be a lot dumber than I thought until a friend who knows how to crochet confirmed these are more advanced patterns. If you know how to crochet this kit has some nice supplies for a good price and the end result looks like it would be cute but would not recommend for somebody who has never crocheted before.UPDATE : went to Michaels and bought some better quality yarn that is slightly thicker. Also looked up some different YouTube videos that were easier to follow than those included in the kit. SO much easier and I've figured out how to do several stitches. I think I'll be able to come back to doing this kit later after getting more basics down with the easier yarn.

I have to admit I was geeked out when my ice maker arrived. I spent several hours making ice for no reason and watching as the ice dropped and the mechanical scooper lifted the ice into the basket.I was impressed...from when you plugged the machine in and turned it on it only took 7-8 minutes to make a batch of ice. Although I was impressed I waited to review this until after I had a gathering to see how well it kept up with my guest's consumption.I turned the machine on about 3hrs before I had guests and the basket was full and the machine sat idle for a bit until the ice was starting to get consumed. I have to say the machine kept up very well...we never ran out of ice.The machine isn't silent but it isn't loud either. If you have people talking in the room you barely notice it running in the background. You will see reviews with folks whining that the ice melts while in the holding basket. The whiners aren't wrong but it doesn't matter because the machine will take the ice corpses and make more ice. Not only that the water in the reservoir will get colder and colder which will increasingly make the ice last longer.Bottom line...for the price, ease of operation and ease of cleaning this little gem is worth the money.Cheers!

Not “chewable” ice
Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024Verified Purchase
The machine is nice, it is easy to set up and starts making ice quick. It is not noisy, and you can hear the ice drop into the basket only if you are the same room as the machine. The instructions are easy to read and make set up very simple.However, this is not “ chewable “ ice as described and that is what I needed/wanted. Even on the small setting the cubes are rather big, bullet size. They come out a bit wet and easily stick together. The plastic scooper will easily break if you are trying to break up the clumps of ice. I would suggest a metal scooper to do this with.I am returning this though, as I needed a more if chewable ice … smaller ice. This did not fit my needs.

Works great!
Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased this because as a teacher who usually gets a summer school assignment in classrooms without a working projector (3 years in a row), I wanted something that was 1) portable, 2) works with either my phone or computer, 3) has sound, and 4) WORKS! This meets all of my requirements. Pretty user friendly for me to set up (& I’m seriously tech challenged when it comes to this kind of stuff!). There’s an app for my phone to connect. I also purchased an adapter cable. For as small as this is, the sound is pretty good, and the picture quality is sharp! For carting it to a whole classroom though, I also purchased some smaller speakers to plug in.Although my regular classroom has a mounted (& working!) projector, I wish I had gotten this sooner! It makes a huge difference to know that I can still have a projector, even if the random classroom assignment’s projector for summer school doesn’t work. (Summer school typically farms us out to the classroom reject rooms…true story….) I’ve also used this at home, like setting it up in the backyard with friends, and did not disappoint!To sum up: I am happy with this projector so far for the few months I’ve had it. The portability and great quality make this super convenient and useful to own…This purchase was worth the investment!

Great compact projector
Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2024Verified Purchase
This is an awesome little projector. Set up is quick and easy and with an adapter I already had, I could quickly hook it up to my iPhone and play a video. The phone did download the drivers to make it work but it streamed beautifully from the AppleTV app. This would be great for backyard movies with a small audience. For a larger audience you would need an external speaker because even at max volume it's not really that loud and honestly, you probably would prefer one. The sound lacks depth, squarely in the mid-range.Great value for the price. I have a larger, pricier projector that isn't this bright. I was able to use it indoors on an overcast day and see well enough for a picture with a lot of contrast. If you are watching something very dark, you might need a full or mostly dark room.Pros:Compact and easy to set upGood picture brightnessEasy to focusCons:Sound could have more depth, but this is to be expected for a small device and you can easily hook up an external speakerSound doesn't get very loud

I've had 'em all  -  This is BIG WIN!
Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023Size: 128GBStyle: Headset OnlyVerified Purchase
So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....- The clarity of the new ""pancake"" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive,  Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion.  I went back and played some older games,  finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge  Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away.  There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.The Mixed Reality / PassthroughAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture!  You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.How about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.The beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So,  now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set.  One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room  becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!Of course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which,  I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like ""who wants this?  I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual"". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart.  Now it's, ""oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!"". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.The comfortWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.Battery life ...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.PCVRLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!Overall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.

The Meta Quest 3 is a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible gaming experience. The graphics are crisp, the tracking is smooth, and the overall immersion is top-notch. The headset is comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, and the controllers are easy to use.However, my main gripe with the Meta Quest 3 is the battery life. At about 2 hours of playtime, it can be frustrating to have to stop and recharge the headset, especially when you're in the middle of a game. I wish the battery life was longer so I could enjoy uninterrupted gaming sessions. Overall, the Meta Quest 3 is a great device, but the battery life could definitely be improved.

Great fan and works plugged in!
Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2024Color: Dark GreenVerified Purchase
This fan isn’t quite as strong as some others i’ve used and is just a fan, no cooling (AC) effect. But this fan has a long battery life and even better-works while plugged in! I work in a hot kitchen so if the fan dies i just plug in to a battery pak, keep it in my pocket and as long as the battery pak has charge the fan will not turn off unless you want it to. This is huge for me-i overheat super easy and love in a desert. Hightly recommend! Also i have trashed 2 neck fans in the time i have had this one and it’s going strong. Stay cool ya’ll!

Great battery life
Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2023Color: Dark GreenVerified Purchase
This is my 3rd fan. I've always been pleased, but consistently have a problem with just a piece or 2 of my hair getting caught in the right side. I've had this just a few weeks and already it's not working on right side. I've blown air through it, looked to be sure I didn't have any hair caught that maybe I didn't feel. Nothing. So it's not working the way I need it to. If I mess with it it'll come on, but not as strong as the other side. Makes me sad. I guess I'll need to look for another brand next time.Very comfortable to wear, keeps neck and behind ears cool regardless of the air around you.I wear this at my job cashiering, naturally I'm right by the doors that automatically are opening and closing constantly. Living in Florida and the brutal summer we had I was able to work wearing this without issue. Battery is great. I turn it on low and run it from start to finish and can even keep it running while I make dinner. We are talking from 8am until it dies around 5-5:30pm. That's keeping it on low.I have bought a 2nd one as the 1st did start having a loud noise when for some reason fan blades on left side started sounding strange. I'm hearing that same sound in this 2nd pair. It's not terrible, but annoying to not just you, but those near. I carry it in a padded lunch box to prevent it from being banged when it's not on charger or in use.I have long curly hair and it does grab loose strands once in awhile, but not bad and it's only occurred a few times.I was training someone who is pregnant,with the heat generated from being in constant motion and those doors she was miserable, but I loaned her this. She was surprised at just how much such a small thing like this helped. A coworker bought the same one after I. Loaned it to her and we both love them.Other then the left fan motor i have zero complaints with this product. It's comfortable, great battery, doesn't heat too the touch of make neck sweaty,and doesn't fall off my neck as I work.

HELP FOR HOTFLASHES
Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2023Color: Dark GreenVerified Purchase
I recently started experiencing hot flashes (HF), 1-3 and hour and during the night. I've been desperate for any relief.  I saw this fan several days ago on Amazon and was skeptical on if it would work as advertised.  I just got this yesterday and I'm so glad I did!  It is helping tremendously on cooling me down. Last night I had it in my bed and when I'd wake up with a HF, I'd either put it around my neck or just hold it toward where I needed cooling the most. I used a ceiling fan and a standing fan next to my bed but found the constant airflow makes my joints and muscles ache so this is good for intermittent relief.  It came already charged so I can't comment on the duration but so far it's running well. I've only needed to use it on the lowest setting. The airflow is surprisingly cool and the sound is minimal but gets a little louder (but not bad) on med/high. I thought having it around my neck would be annoying esp. during a HF but it's comfortable and is not heavy on the neck at all.  I'm looking forward to using it while traveling.  The convenience of having my hands free as I walk around is a plus! I was recently on a plane and had to use the safety instructions as a fan, embarrassing! This has the look of headphones, so the person sitting next to me will not know I'm having a HF. I purchased the green and its the beautiful deep color as shown.  I highly recommend this fan and I usually do not write reviews but want to help those who may be suffering as I am w/HF's or those just trying to stay cool.

My Nikes came in w/out a box, wrapped in plastic, in a plastic bag... It surprised me that it didn't get any damage while traveling... Thankfully! These fit great (I'm usually a size 11, maybe 10.5... but after seeing some reviews all over, I decided to buy a 11.5 and it fit perfectly). These tennis are great for training, great stability while lifting weights (something I was missing by using running shoes). The color is even louder and better live than as seen in these pics. Take a chance!

I got this as a gift for my boyfriend's Christmas present and he loves it. It does take up a lot of counter space, but the ability to make low-fat, low-carb, protein treats has been great! It's very loud when it runs, so if you envision churning up a pint at 2 AM and don't want to wake up the house, think again. Also, it came with 2 pots and they need to pre-freeze for 24 hours so you do have to plan accordingly (or buy more pints). There are a lot of great recipes out on the internet for beginners.

Easy to use to make ice cream and other frozen desserts
Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2024Size: (2) 24 oz. PintsVerified Purchase
Purchased a Cremi after tasting chef son-in-law's mango sorbet.  Wow.  Have been really enjoying--homemade ice cream every night!  It does take a bit of experimentation to find bases you like the texture of, but once you do, easy and quick to prepare a couple of containers.  I generally use a blender to help prepare the mixtures.  At this point, banana and strawberry ice cream are biggest favorites, along with a mango, peach, etc. sorbet made from a frozen fruit mix.I will also note--since some reviewers prefer standard Cuisinar ice cream maker--that we have had one of those for a number of years, but it rarely gets used.  Freezing unit is way too big to keep in the freezer all the time, and the time to make ice cream is tedious.  I can easily store 2-4 Cremi containers in our freezes, then just a few minutes to have ice cream.  I also find the spun Cremi tends to have a better consistency for eating later (the traditional tends to get pretty hard).  So, I absolutely cannot agree with reviewers that prefer something like the Cuisinart!  We have made *vastly* more ice cream with the Cremi, in a month, than  we have made with the Cuisinart in years.Tip:  if your leftover Cremi is too stiff, try zapping the container in the microwave for 5-10secs instead of respinning it.  We have found that multiple respinnings can wreck the texture.  Respin only if the first spin leaves a powdery texture.

Finally I can have ice cream as I like it!
Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2022Size: (2) 16 oz. PintsVerified Purchase
This is now the third time in my life I've tried a home ice cream maker. Well, third time is the charm! This machine is AMAZING! The chocolate hazelnut gelato you see pictured above is made with skim milk and sweetened with allulose, making it low calorie while still completely delicious and creamy. How the machine gets skim milk so creamy I have no idea! It's even better if you use a little half and half. The pint I made tonight was 315 calories for the whole pint, and it has exactly what I want in it. I hate all other non-sugar sweeteners, and I prefer not to have tons of fat and sugar. Here are the advantages of the Creami over my discarded ice cream makers of the past:--it seems to be nearly fool proof. You won't always get a great result if you're just winging it, but you do generally end up with actual ice cream. In the other ice cream makers, if you got the proportions wrong, it would sometimes not really freeze or it would get icy.--It's so much easier to get the ice cream out and to clean! The ice cream maker I had with a compressor was such a pain--you had to get the ice cream out around the paddle, or dig the paddle out of the ice cream, and invariably you end up making a mess. The Creami pints are so much easier to deal with. Even the lid, which is a little more annoying, is pretty easy to clean once you know what to do. (Read the manual, even though you have to go online to get it--it's important to take out the rubber gasket and clean under it.)--It doesn't matter if you have leftovers that freeze hard as a rock. We never enjoyed eating ice cream from our other makers on the next day, because they always hardened so much in the freezer. (And you had to make so much we always had leftovers.) With the Creami, if the leftovers freeze hard, you can just process them again and have just as good an experience the next day.The only real downsides I can see are 1) you have to wait 24 hours for your pint to freeze before you can make it into ice cream, and 2) the horrendous noise the machine makes. It's seriously loud, and the sound changes in alarming ways as the blade makes its way down and back up. The first few times I ran it, I was afraid something was going to break or blow up or something. I am now starting to get used to it and know the weird noises are normal. Dealing with the racket is totally worth it!If you've tried an ice cream maker before and decided it wasn't worth the hassle, give this one a try. It's wonderful!

I am constantly buying new make-up products based on recommendations and things I see online and usually they turn out to be just all right or like many other products but I can say with this product I actually see and notice that my make up looks better! I apply it and it is the only product that gives me this natural sunkissed look. I have pale to fair skin and this color still looks very natural on me.

Quick color, not so great applicator
Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2024Color: Deep Maple EhSize: 1 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I love this product in general but not 💯. I originally bought a blush color when I was looking at some more expensive alternatives. I am no makeup expert and usually have 5 minutes or less to throw makeup on. Typically I use a very light foundation concealer stick , use the blush color on my cheekbones, and then am using this color as bronzer. It is similar to a lipstick texture without being too heavy on the skin. Sometimes when I first apply it feels a little tacky but then subsides. I do not use the little brush as I don’t feel like it blends to my liking. I use a flat kabuki and it blends great.  I do not have any issues with skin sensitivity.I am fairer skinned white pink undertones but, do tan in the summer. To me this color is a little more clay toned than I would like. I would like a little more brown tone than reddish. However, I am able to blend it and it look natural.I love that I can use this product with a touch of concealer and be on my way.

Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
When I got this my wife was pretty skeptical.  But it took only a single use of this device to make a fan of her.She likes to use cashew milk to make protein shakes.  If you have been to a grocery store lately you know you need to take out an equity loan to buy the stuff.  But with this device a handful of cashews and a few hours' time and you've got rich, creamy cashew milk! She was incredulous.  How can something so simple make a healthy, tasty, creamy milk with NO chemical or flavor additives?  Well, it just does.It couldn't be simpler.  There is no complicated mixing, or constant watching required.  It does the heavy lifting literally while you sleep.  I can tell you that her skepticism dissolved immediately.If you like nut milk this thing could save you many trips to the store, and a good deal of money.  And then you know exactly what you are drinking - no long list of ingredients to read and interpret.

Makes making nut milks a breeze
Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
There isn't much to making nut milks, but this makes it even easier. It's a quick and simple process.  Add nuts, add water, turn it on, and 15 minutes later, you have nut milk. I did it without soaking the nuts. Some nuts should be strained, like almonds, unless you don't mind the almond bits.  It comes with a small strainer and a nut bag. I used the bag and then added a little rum extract because I wanted to see how it would taste in the almond milk (it was great).Today, I made soy milk. It takes a bit longer than nut milk but not long. I didn’t soak the soy beans but the soy milk is nice and I only strained it with the small strainer that came with it, not the nut bag. It’s warm and creamy. Delicious.I like that this makes about 32 oz of nut, soy or oat milk and the overall design of the machine is quite nice. The only thing I don't like much is the cover .... it feels lightweight and cheap.

Easy enough to use, but made terrible oat milk
Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
We got this to make homemade oat milk. We were hoping this would make the process easier so we didn't need to keep buying it from the store and wasting containers. We used the oat milk setting and the recommended recipe, but it was terrible.We first tried it and it tasted like leftover oat water - there weren't nearly enough oats to make it taste like oat milk. So we tried again, this time adding twice the oats and some honey to help sweeten it. The second time it came out slimy - YUCK! It takes the machine approximately 6 minutes to make the oat milk. It also heats it slightly. I think it ended up taking too long and heating it up only made it worse.Next time, I'll use ice-cold water and just blend it for 30-45 seconds as I usually do. This was not a good investment for me.NOTE: As an Amazon Vine reviewer, I receive this product without paying for it directly; however, I have to claim the full value of this product on my taxes as this counts as a taxable gift and I must pay taxes for the taxable value of this item.

Get for Large Size Nut Milks
Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
If you have a large family or just like making larger portion nut milks this is a great option. The machine itself holds 32oz of liquid with programmable auto start feature. It's pretty straightforward to use and makes a variety nut milks, oat, juice and shakes. It also has a rice paste and boil water mode which is interesting. Note the only issue with this unit is you do have to manually start the ""cooking"" mode separately from the grinding mode. So if you finish grinding your soy beans you need to push the start again for it to begin the cooking mode to heat up. But the machine is fairly quick at about 10 minutes. The clean up is pretty easy with the cleaning mode too. Overall a good small appliance for those oat/nut milk lovers looking to make there own.

I will say though, that the automation is the bonus. You can dump your stuff in there and leave it to its own devices, drain it out, then let it be. Just wish it was faster.

Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
I have been wanting one of these for a long time so was very excited to get this.  So far I have only tried almonds, but it is easy, add about a quarter cup of almonds, fill up to max w fresh water and turn on for 8 minute cycle (automatically set).  The milk was good, I added a little vanilla after.  It is still a little gritty but that is fine w me, it comes w a strainer if you want it finer.  I also have tried the cleaning cycle which took 8 minutes, seems like a long time to clean so the second time I just rinsed out.  I will clean occasionally but think rinsing thoroughly should be ok too.  The milk lasted for several days in the refrigerator.  I will try soy milk and oat milk for sure, will update if any issues but so far very satisfied.

Perfect cookies at warp speed if you follow the directions and do what they say
Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2016Style: Cookie PressVerified Purchase
I bought this press on sale through the warehouse deals.  Supposedly just damaged packaging but the package looked fine.  When I went to make a batch I noticed I couldn't get the top off, so I loaded it from the bottom and made a bunch of adorable cookies that tasted great.  The unit cranked out those cookies in warp speed and they cooked up perfectly.  When I was done I figured I would soak the press in warm water and finally get it unscrewed for cleaning as some dough got trapped between the chambers...no luck.  I guess that is why it was returned but now I have a press with cookie dough all stuck on it to return...yuk!I chatted with Amazon, told them the situation and they credited me for the cost of the press and I am ordering another...no need to send it back.  This is why I shop here..so hassle free.Manufacturing defect aside, this was the most effortless press I have ever used!  I found after I primed the unit and scraped off the dough as instructed I still had to do a double press to get the first cookie out, which was now double the size of all the rest.  No problem, I just scooped it up and put it back in the bowl for the next batch.  Nothing was wasted.  The rest of the cookies came out perfect with one press and if I had enough cookie sheets I could have knocked out the entire dough batch in about ten minutes...EVEN with reload time!  I used a teaspoon to press out any air pockets...made sure my pan was ungreased and cold (made sure the pan cooled before I loaded on another batch) rotated the pan in the oven halfway through as suggested in the recipe and every cookie came out picture perfect in warp speed.  I loved how easy it was to change disks between batches so I was able to check out several of the designs and they all came out adorable.  The cookies are petite but I like that...some others complained they were too small...I find the small size adds to their charm.  I made the lemon poppy seed variation of the butter cookie included with the unit...I'm a lemon freak so next time I will double the amount of lemon extract, but it still made for a tender, flavorful cookie with a hint of lemon.  I purchased the autumn disk set but have not used it yet.  Wanted the spring set but they are unavailable at the moment.My only regret is that I will have to wait for the new press to arrive to make more cookies...Update:  The new press works great and I since I couldn't find a good lemon cookie recipe for this press I created one that I am thrilled with.  If you're looking for a mild lemon flavor...move on, this is NOT the cookie for you.Lemon Poppy Sunflower Cookies2 Sticks cold butter cut into teaspoon slices3 ounces softened cream cheese1 cup sugar1 egg yolkI teaspoon lemon oil (I got this at King Arthur Flour) if you use extract, double it and add more as desiredI heaping teaspoon of european lemon zest (King Arthur again) fresh zest of one lemon would be fine1 teaspoon lemon powder (King Arthur) have no idea what to sub here maybe double the zest2 1/2 Cups King Arthur All Purpose Flour (the only flour I use)1/4 teaspoon of salt (if your using salted butter you can skip this)Poppy seedsLemon sugar (again King Arthur, but I was disappointed how minimal the taste was...perfect lemon yellow color however so I used it...a nice lemon yellow sanding sugar would work just fine)Makes 8 dozen cookiesPreheat oven to 350 degreesCream butter and cream cheese and sugar  (I used my Kitchenaid mixer and it took a lot longer than you would think)  Look for the mixture to change color to a light yellow almost white with no lumps of butter showing, it should be light and fluffy...took me about 10 minutes on medium speed)Add egg yolk, lemon oil, lemon zest, lemon powder mix until well combine and then taste to see if it's lemony enough for you and adjust as needed (I added more lemon powder as a first instinct).Combine flour and salt and slowly add to butter mixture while mixing...here's where a lot of people go wrong, don't be afraid to mix this, you won't get a tough cookie but if it's not light enough it won't go through the press.Load the dough with a teaspoon into the press fitted with the sunflower disc, pushing the dough down with the teaspoon to push out any air pockets, if any dough starts coming out of the press just pop it back in the bowl for the next batch.  Press cookies out on a COLD UNGREASED COOKIE SHEET.  Don't try to use parchment, foil or silpat, it just won't work.  I've never had a cookie stick or break.  You may have to press twice to get the first cookie out, this will be bigger than the rest, I just scoop it up, put it back in the bowl and press another in it's place. Dust with lemon sugar or yellow sanding sugar and then sprinkle poppy seeds in the center.  I use a 1/8th teaspoon for this and tried several different ways, one depressing the center with the measuring spoon and pouring some poppy seeds in...but in the end I just sprinkled some around the center (there is a peak in the very center) I liked the way this looked the best.Baking: my oven is true to temp and at first I baked for 12 minutes, rotating the pan after 6 minutes.  The end result was a cookie that was golden just around the edges and somewhat pale.  The texture was delicate with a nice crumb.  Next I tried at 14 minutes rotating after 7 minutes.  Now the end result had the golden color encroaching up the petals a bit and I just loved this look!  Much more reminiscent of a real sunflower.  The texture was now crispy and I preferred it by far.Now these cookies are amazing just as is, but I'm planning on melting some lemon wafers (King Arthur) and dipping the bottoms in it for a cookie that will hit it out of the park.  Also thought about sandwiching two cookies between some of the melted lemon wafers but that may be just too much cookie.  I'll update with the results.Hope you enjoy this recipe!UPDATE: dipping the bottoms in the melted lemon wafers was just too much of a hassle so I put a dollop of about 1/8th-1/4 teaspoon of the melted lemon wafers on the flat side of a cookie and sandwiched it with another.  The small size of the cookie was perfect for this and I just loved the result.  I melted about a half cup of wafers in the microwave for 2-30 second burst on high and it was enough to sandwich about 40 cookies (80 cookies sandwiched).  I left the rest as is.  This cookie is a winner IMHO.ANOTHER UPDATE: Duh! I lined a sheet with parchment paper, put a dollop of melted lemon wafer on the paper and centered a cookie on it and pressed gently.  Worked like a charm.  You could also put the dollop directly on the back of the cookie and then place on the sheet...I posted some photos.  Here you don't want any brown color so I baked for 12 minutes rotating after 6.

            I bought this press on sale through the warehouse deals.  Supposedly just damaged packaging but the package looked fine.  When I went to make a batch I noticed I couldn't get the top off, so I loaded it from the bottom and made a bunch of adorable cookies that tasted great.  The unit cranked out those cookies in warp speed and they cooked up perfectly.  When I was done I figured I would soak the press in warm water and finally get it unscrewed for cleaning as some dough got trapped between the chambers...no luck.  I guess that is why it was returned but now I have a press with cookie dough all stuck on it to return...yuk!I chatted with Amazon, told them the situation and they credited me for the cost of the press and I am ordering another...no need to send it back.  This is why I shop here..so hassle free.Manufacturing defect aside, this was the most effortless press I have ever used!  I found after I primed the unit and scraped off the dough as instructed I still had to do a double press to get the first cookie out, which was now double the size of all the rest.  No problem, I just scooped it up and put it back in the bowl for the next batch.  Nothing was wasted.  The rest of the cookies came out perfect with one press and if I had enough cookie sheets I could have knocked out the entire dough batch in about ten minutes...EVEN with reload time!  I used a teaspoon to press out any air pockets...made sure my pan was ungreased and cold (made sure the pan cooled before I loaded on another batch) rotated the pan in the oven halfway through as suggested in the recipe and every cookie came out picture perfect in warp speed.  I loved how easy it was to change disks between batches so I was able to check out several of the designs and they all came out adorable.  The cookies are petite but I like that...some others complained they were too small...I find the small size adds to their charm.  I made the lemon poppy seed variation of the butter cookie included with the unit...I'm a lemon freak so next time I will double the amount of lemon extract, but it still made for a tender, flavorful cookie with a hint of lemon.  I purchased the autumn disk set but have not used it yet.

Great for Cookies - Won't Work for Making Churros
Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2021Style: Cookie PressVerified Purchase
If you want to make pretty cookie shapes in no time, this is the product you're looking for. I've been a longtime fan of OXO products, they're all terrific. So I had high expectations of this cookie press. It definitely delivers, as far as ease of use, and the end result you get when making cookies. That said, I do have one important question....Why doesn't OXO make a disc for churros?I came across a similar kitchen gadget that was used to make churros. I normally just a frosting piping tip in a plastic bag for shaping my churro dough before frying. The catch is that I can't make them very thick. And I can't automatically make the hollow churros that can be filled with sweet stuff after you fry them up. Instead of just ordering a churro press, I figured I'd try this cookie press out. So no matter what, I've at least got a really good cookie press. I tried experimenting with different discs, but it just wasn't going to work for churros. It does work great in that you can hold the press sideways, and just click out long shapes (then cut with a knife when it reaches the right size). But the dough doesn't come out as a single, solid piece. At least, not in a shape vaguely resembling that of a churro. That you can't make churros with these isn't a bad thing. OXO doesn't advertise the product as something you could make churros with. I just had hoped that I would be able to do it. I can't, so I just buckled and ordered myself a churro press.Overall, I'm happy with this cookie press. Works well, and you won't strain your hand much, like with some cheap cookie presses out there. So if you want a nice cookie press, add this one to your cart, and buy it today.

⭐⭐⭐⭐The OXO Good Grips 14-Piece Cookie Press Set has certainly made my baking adventures more enjoyable. The variety of discs and shapes included in the set offer a creative touch to my cookie presentations, and the sturdy construction of the press itself gives me confidence in its durability.The ergonomic design of the handles with the Good Grips feature lives up to its name, making it comfortable to use even during extended baking sessions. The clear barrel allows me to monitor the cookie dough level easily, preventing any unexpected interruptions in the middle of my baking.The set also comes with a handy storage case, which helps keep everything organized and easily accessible. While the press works well overall, I found that occasionally some dough gets stuck in the mechanism, requiring a bit of extra effort to clear. This is a minor inconvenience but worth mentioning.All in all, the OXO Good Grips 14-Piece Cookie Press Set is a reliable and versatile tool for any avid baker. Despite the minor issue with dough sticking, the variety of shapes and the ease of use make it a valuable addition to my kitchen arsenal.

Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2024Size: X-LargeColor: Wine redVerified Purchase
I was looking for lightweight pants to wear on an upcoming East Coast trip. These looked fun and outside my usual boring wheelhouse, so I decided to give them a try. Wow! They fit comfortably. They're made out of thin, lightweight material. They have cinches at the waist, at two points on each leg, and at the cuffs for a customized fit, but when left as is they're delightfully poofy and balloon-y. They remind me of a red ripstop nylon paratrooper jumpsuit I had when I was 18. I don't know what happened to that thing, but these make me happy the way that did. The red color is vibrant without being gaudy, making these a pair of pants pleasingly unlike everything else I own and that I'll want to wear all the time. If you know me, you know I rarely ever write Amazon reviews, so something really has to make an impact for me to decide to write about it. I love these. They're just well-made and comfortable and good. Everybody needs that.

Wow!  I wasn't sure I would like this when I bought it but when I received and tried it on it actually fit me well, looked super cool and felt very light and comfortable.  By the way, the swishing sound that the pants make is not as bad as some reviewers said.  I bought the blue in X-Small which I wear when pants are meant to be baggy which is the style of these cargo pants.  Love all the pockets and the cinching at the bottom as well as at the knees.  Very nice touch!  Great for hiking and will probably keep you cool in hot weather and warm in cool weather.  Attention Manufacturer:  Please make these pants in a cropped/capri and bermuda style shorts and you'll have a super winner and sell them out!  I'm buying other colors now.  Thanks!

I usually wear a medium in pants. Medium of these were too big. Really long and waist loose. They do have strings to tighten  them, so if you like the oversized look then stick to your size. But if you like a more fitted look like I do, then size down. Great pants though, lightweight and comfy.

Opinion from a former iPhone user
Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2022Size: 256 GBStyle: Phone OnlyColor: LemongrassVerified Purchase
Before into the Pixel 7, I have been using an iPhone12 mini for 2 years. And a Samsung Note 9 before that. Why I chose the iPhone12 mini? Because I wanted a real compact phone. And Why I bought the Pixel 7 now? Well, 1. I want better battery life. 2. I want bigger screen for games and for navigation. 3. IOS just bored me.So, I got the Pixel 7 lemongrass 256g for 599$ and have been using it for a week now. And here are my opinions.In short words, if you have been using Android and want an upgrade now, I really recommend Pixel 7, mainly because it gives you good software experience and decent camera at a very fair price.Exterior & comfort:The color lemon grass is special and I like it. The visor camera bump looks unique and kinda cool in my opinion. The rounded edge makes the phone comfortable to hold. HOWEVER, there are some cons. 1. The bump and the glass back make it awkward to place on any flat surface. 2. The bump is a huge dust collector. 3. Although the edge of the flat screen has a bit of curve, the transition to the metal frame is not good, which means the touch of the edge areas feels a bit cheap, definitely not comparable to Note 9. Overall, I think the look is unique but comes with some sacrifices, and the build quality is fairly good for the price.Operating System:This is the first time I use the so called ""pure"" Android. Compared to Samsung's OneUI, the OS on Pixel 7 feels more like Apple's iOS actually. It doesn't have as many customization functions as OneUI and is simpler to use. Kinda like iOS, but in a different style, well, the kinda nerdy Google style. If you like it you like it. Some special Google AI features are cool, but should not be the only reason for anyone to buy this phone in my opinion. I haven't experienced many bugs. Actually, only one when switching between bluetooth audio devices that really bothers me a bit. Overall, I like the system, and I think it is good for anyone but people who have only used iPhone before.Camera:Pixel has always been famous for its camera capabilities. I must say it is true on Pixel 7. It takes very decent photos no matter the light conditions, and the shoot experience is simple and natural. Is it as good or better as flagship phones like iPhone 14 pro? I don't know, maybe not. But as someone who uses a dedicated camera for street photography, I think the camera on Pixel 7 is more than capable to take nice looking daily photos and capture those little moments into good memories. When it comes to video, it is also good, especially considering the price, but iPhone is better. And I mean iPhone 12 mini. So overall, the camera is very good.Battery life:Not much to say here since I don't bother to do any ""tests"" and have no numbers. But based on my feeling, it is good, but not as good as I expected considering the battery capacity. It will last you a full day (8 hours) or more if you use it lightly. But it is no way a two-day or 1.5 day battery life.Gaming:Gaming is trash. At least for pubg mobile. It is probably due to software issue (not optimized for Tensor chip) rather than lack of raw performance. But if you play a lot of 3D mobile games, avoid this one.Conclusion:Decent phone for the price. Actually, even for the normal price ($100 more than what I spent), it is still more than decent. If you don't want to spend that much on a phone (which is a terribly stupid trend in my opinion), this is the phone for you. Don't look at iPhone SE, that thing is a joke.

No bloatware, nice camera, but battery life is short
Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2024Size: 128 GBStyle: Phone OnlyColor: ObsidianVerified Purchase
I've had this Google Pixel 7 phone now for about 8 months, after having used Samsung phones for years. The #1 best thing if you switch from Samsung is the absence of all that bloatware, those apps you never use and can't uninstall either. This phone saves so much memory by just not having those apps, and it makes it easier to sort through the apps you do have and find the one you need quickly and efficiently. Huge relief, and that's probably the #1 reason I wouldn't go back to Samsung. Photography is my hobby and for the first time this year, I did not use my SLR camera at all. I feel bad but the camera on this phone was versatile enough for my purposes! Picture quality is excellent. The magic eraser feature in editing is quite a game changer. The fact that the phone saves photos directly to your Google drive is also nice though sharing pics to social media from there isn't that straightforward. I do it all the time but I haven't figured out how to post multiple pics without them appearing in backward order. The biggest negative for the Google Pixel 7 phone is that I need to charge it just about every day. Keep in mind that I don't use it for gaming or listening to music or watching videos. I literally just use it to text, call, google stuff, occasionally for social media, and maps if I'm driving which isn't every day. Even so, I have to charge it approximately every 30 hours. This is the one thing they need to change on this phone. I have a 2022 model and it looks like I'll be getting updates until 2026 which gives them enough time to work on that! The other thing is that fingerprint recognition rarely works. When it does seem to work, I think it's actually the facial recognition thing that comes on at the same time that's opening the phone. Facial recognition works great fortunately. Oh, and just for kicks: the feature I like best that the phone comes with is ""Now Playing"" that identifies what song is currently playing. I put it on my home screen so that I don't have to switch on my phone to activate it. Just a light touch and it tells me what the mystery song I'm hearing in a cafe or on the radio is. My 20-yr-old nephew who is an iPhone user was actually envious of this feature! It's not an app -- it's just a feature that appears in Settings>Sound. To summarize: do I like this phone and would I recommend it? A resounding yes. Should battery life be improved? Also a resounding yes.

Absolutely Worth It!
Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2023Color: BlackVerified Purchase
The quality is superb - everything from the material, to the stuffing, the stitching, the zipper, etc.! It is easy to assemble and super soft and comfy, yet supportive enough to really provide that extra comfort. An added bonus is the customer service these guys provide is far better than any other! They really care about their product & customers. I think my 6lb. Chihuahua is enjoying it the most as he feels like a King in this super comfy bed! It may seem like a lot of money, but for the quality of the product, customer service & ability to throw the cover in the wash, I think it’s well worth it!

So comfy!!! The original is definitely worth it
Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024Color: PinkVerified Purchase
Just got my SECOND Plufl Human Dog bed because the first one was such a big hit in my house that I needed to get two just to keep everyone happy. I wanted to share some of my favorite things about the Plufl and why I think it is worth the price, especially compared to some of the cheaper items available. A few of my friends have bought knockoffs so I have been able to compare with theirs and after experiencing mine, most of them regret their purchase.The base: Most of the cheaper version use a piece of foam that is so flimsy and cheap that I can basically feel the floor. The Plufl mattress almost is as supportive as my bed which is great for when multiple people are using it and doesn’t make me feel achy.Fur: The Plufl fur is the SOFTEST thing ever. Literally. It is so soft haha. I could lay it in at all day and never overheat or feel stuffy like a lot of faux furs out there.Border: The border of the Plufl is by far my favorite part. It is so big and soft that I literally feel like I am in a cocoon when I am sleeping. A lot of other ones the bolster is pretty flimsy or just made with scrap foam while the Plufl is literally HUGE pillows which I am in love with.

Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
It was a little difficult to get it all to fit, you have to assemble the bed yourself. So if you need to wash the cover you will have to reassemble it as well. But it was totally worth it as the memory foam/gel gives you the support  you need while also it is comfortable and soft you won't want to get out of it.

Can't Beat the Original
Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I saw the Plufl on Shark Tank and knew I had to have it for my apartment. However, after seeing the price tag, I went with one of the cheaper alternates thinking it wouldn't make much of a difference. The knockoff I bought was basically just a big dog bed: super uncomfortable and scratchy. I eventually caved in and bought the real Plufl. To my delight, the difference between the knockoff and real deal was astonishing.The product is as comfy as advertised and easy to assemble/disassemble for weekly washing. The memory foam padding isn't something to cheap out on – the neck support has made all the difference when lounging in the Plufl. It's bigger than I'd anticipated, so I felt like I was getting more bang for my buck when I saw the whole thing assembled.Customer service was also terrific. The Plufl account was quick to respond to my questions about delivery and assembly. As a conscious consumer, it also helps to know I'm supporting an American business.5 stars all around for the Plufl.

I wanted one of these since they first came out and I finally talked myself into it and I'm so happy I did!  We have a 17 pound Chug named Daisy who is the absolute love of our lives.  She's a huge cuddler and loves everything soft.  So what could be better than a large doggy bed that mommy or daddy and Daisy can lay in and cuddle in front of the TV downstairs?  This is it!!  It's so soft and warm and cuddly.  My husband laughed at me when it was delivered and laughed even harder once I put it together and he saw the size of it.  Who's laughing now???? He's in it more than the dog!

I got this for my grandmother, who loves to craft and DIY and put together little projects, but who has horrible, horrible arthritis, for Christmas. I figured it would be a risk, but knew she would love the finished product, and planned on going to help her with it. However, before I had the chance to go and see her, she had the whole thing practically finished! The pieces varied in size, but were all round and sturdy enough that they were easy enough for her to put together, even with her arthritic fingers and knuckles, and she said she liked the way they snapped into place. Also, the pattern was dispersed well across the pieces so it was tricky in a way that remained fun without being too difficult. The finished product is beautiful and sturdy enough to hold a few fake flowers.

My daughter loves assembling things.  She owns many lego and lego like structures.  I saw the lego and other brands of flowers and thought that would be different.  Then I had a brainstorm, instead of buying a regular old flower vase, I found this vase puzzle.  They go perfectly together.  Lego puzzle flowers and a puzzle vase.  The vase is beautiful.  It barely looks like a puzzle and the maker claims that would hold water just like a glass vase and although we had no use to put water in, the vase is so tight once constructed that I would believe it would hod water.  A terrific product.  A great gift.

This was a gift--took them only about an hour to put together
Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2023Size: TranslucentColor: Flowers and BirdsVerified Purchase
The only complaint I have about the vase is that I wish it were just a TAD bigger. The dimensions are given in the listing, but seeing the vase in person makes you realize that is quite small--barely the height of a 500 ml of bottled water. However, it does come with the black stand and an insert so that the vase can actually be used with real flowers.. The vase also does not require any glue or tools--just patience and a knack for 3-D puzzles. Despite some reviews indicating that the curved puzzle can be challenging, it only has 160 pieces and the person I gave it to (my adult daughter) managed to put the thing together in about an hour. She found it fairly easy because the pieces are grouped in numbered bags, and you are supposed to assemble the pieces in number order.  She was able to move it around without it falling apart. When put together, the vase is actually quite pretty and would make an interesting display piece with or without flowers. I bought the translucent ""Birds and Flowers"" design, which at the time of this review, is apparently no longer available, and being the holidays, the other designs seem to be limited as well. The price has also gone up nearly double--which I know would have made me choose another product. If Amazon does get some more stock in, and the price goes back down, I think these would be really cute things to collect.

This is a beautiful vase
Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2024Size: TranslucentColor: Magpies on Plum TreeVerified Purchase
I purchased this as a gift for my 14-year-old daughter to go with her Lego flower set. She had no problems assembling the vase. She said the set comes in three bags so assembly was easy. It is beautiful and she loves it. I took off one star on sturdiness as she wasn't comfortable holding it from the top as the tube from the center would come out. I assume this is for live plants to be watered. If held from the bottom there is no issues. I highly recommend it as a gift, the quality was great and a fun activity.

71,Saie Dew Blush - Lightweight Liquid Blush with a Blendable + Buildable Cream Finish - Dewy Cheek Tint with Doe Foot Wand Makeup Applicator - Neutral Pink Blush - Sweetie (.40 oz),4.6,259 ratings,300+ bought in past month,"  Dew Blush is a vegan, liquid blush for cheeks that gives a natural flush of just-pinched color with a creamy, radiant finish. It comes with a chubby doe-foot applicator and lightweight formula that lets you create a natural cheek tint (or build up this dewy blush for a deeper wash of color).    Blush, but better. Never streaky or patchy, this hydrating, blendable pink blush melts right into skin for a seamless, lit-from-within glowy flush, and comes in nine beautiful shades.    Licorice root extract is known to naturally brighten the skin, giving you a youthful and more radiant complexion while Elderberry extract fights free-radical and environmental damage. Evening Primrose extract helps moisturize and soothe dry and irritated skin.    Use the chubby doe foot wand to dab one to two dots onto desired areas as a blush tint or stain. For deeper color add more as desired. Blend liquid blush out with fingertips (or The Big Brush) onto apples of cheeks, cheekbones, or anywhere else you want a flush of color.    No parabens, phthalates, sulfates, talc, mineral oil, GMOs, synthetic fragrance, or BHA. Cruelty-free, vegan face makeup.

You have to have a good brush because if your brush is low quality the blush will be patchy so get an expensive makeup brush or get a beauty blender.  If you thinks it’s too pigmented don’t worry because the pigment goes down a lot so you won’t look like a clown!!

A Creative Twist on Coloring
Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023Verified Purchase
I recently had the pleasure of trying out The Reverse Coloring Book™, and I must say it's a game-changer in the world of coloring books! As a coloring enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for something innovative and different, and this book truly exceeded my expectations.The concept of having the colors already on the pages while leaving the lines for you to draw is both refreshing and exciting. It's like a reverse canvas where the vibrant hues serve as your inspiration, encouraging you to let your imagination run wild.The book's size is just right, providing ample space for intricate detailing without feeling overwhelming.One of the standout features for me is the diverse range of designs. It's a great way to unwind after a long day or to spark your creativity during moments of inspiration.It's a fantastic way to disconnect from screens and engage in a mindful, artistic activity. It offers a delightful escape into a world of colors and lines, making it an excellent addition to any artist's collection. Highly recommended!

Interesting concept; would prefer fewer flowers
Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2023Verified Purchase
I came across this reverse coloring book in Amazon and thought it looked interesting, so I ordered it.  It’s unique that instead of coloring inside the outlines, you outline around the existing colors.  The pages are one-sided, decent thickness, and perforated for easy pull-out.  My daughter and I did a couple each.  Overall, we liked it.  However, most of the pictures look like flowers.  I would prefer more free form colors where you can truly use your imagination to create unique pictures, like in 2 of the “attached” pictures.  Overall, it’s a fun twist to the typical coloring book.

Gave 6 of these as holiday gifts; everyone loves them
Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023Verified Purchase
I’ve been intrigued by these in bookstores and decided to order them for my kids for Christmas. Accidentally somehow ordered 6 instead of 2 (oops) but decided to put them in more of our gifts—to my mom, a niece, an artistic uncle… everyone loves them. Even my 10yo, who doesn’t draw or paint as much as his little sister, has been picking it up on his own almost every other day and filling up the pages with some pretty amazing imaginative drawings! I’ve been doodling in one myself, and though I personally hate ordinary coloring books, the concept of this one is strangely calming and satisfying, like finding faces and animals in clouds. Each of us sees different things, and the sense that you’re just tracing what you already sees there feels easy, even when you’re actually doing more creative work than you think you are. Some of the sequels to this book have more amorphous shapes—this one has a lot of pages that are hard NOT to see as flowers—and I’d like to check those out in the future.

Ok. So I’m super creative, I love to draw and color, but I feel like when it comes to coming up with my own idea to draw a picture or create something from my mind, I can’t do it. I’m more of a, look at a picture and recreate it, kind of person. So I was really expecting to have to regift this as I didn’t think I’d be able to draw something out of nothing. Happy surprise when I found that I could!! It’s great for any type of artist, beginner OR advanced! There are plenty of pages that you can see what the picture is supposed to be and kind of just follow the paint splotches to draw it. There are other pages where you can let your creativity flow and come up with any idea. I have totally been telling all of my friends about this book - it’s a must!

I'm new to starting seeds and wasn't sure what to expect.  This certainly works better than my first attempt with a different starter kit just sitting in a bay window.  After that kit melted in the sun, I decided to go with this one with the grow lights.  I sat it in the basement with a heat mat and the grow lights.  So far I've had 2/3 of the seeds I planted sprout. They are just taking longer to germinate than the seed pack said it would. I have a lot more control over temperature and humidity with this set up and it is getting the job done.  Just don't expect results like the photoshopped seedlings shown in the description.

These trays are easy to set up and use. They are the perfect size for us, and the seeds are growing well in them. We have several of these set up in a window on wire shelves. The light bars that you put in them work great, as we are in an area that has many cloudy days in the spring, so these are extremely helpful for our seedlings. We are very happy with these, and will purchase more as needed.

I have a watch collection of about 12 watches. I was looking for a dress watch and was eyeing a Cartier Tank. I had never worn a tank-style watch and wasn't sure the shape was for me. So instead of spending a few thousand bucks to find out if I liked the style, I went the route of the trusty Seiko. I could not be more pleased with this watch. The size is great and the dial is uncluttered and easy to read. There are no lumens...it's a dress watch after all. The tiny crown is delicate and elegant against the thin case and it has beautiful proportions. The band took a minute to break in and honestly, it felt subpar before it was comfortable. This may be due in part to the fact that my daily watch is a 40mm diver with a stainless steel bracelet so I am used to more heft.I bought this as a dress watch but I like it so much and have gotten so many compliments on it that I find myself dressing it down instead. It will be my light summer watch for all occasions I have a feeling. So far as the Cartier goes, I can wait for now because this watch is just that good.

This watch is an obvious nod to the Cartier classic tank watch, but it stands apart with the Arabic numbers and Champagne face which pairs well with the gold case and eel skin(?) strap. It is surprisingly wearable as an everyday watch. Wears well on my 7"" wrist. The price is low because of the quartz movement, but who cares. Quartz is great as a reliable and accurate set-it-and-forget-it everyday watch or that dress watch you seldom wear and want to be able to throw it on without worrying about winding and setting it. Buy it. You'll get a lot of wear out of it.

I love this mat. It definitely takes some getting used to but once you do you’ll want it every night. I use it before I go to bed and just relax and let my mind go blank for a while. Highly recommend.

I was surprised
Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023Verified Purchase
I wasn’t sure what to expect but after getting used to the mat and pillow I found it very relaxing to lay on it and had a really great meditation. I bought the set by going to the store to save some money. After cervical spine surgery, I have struggled with some occipital neuralgia so I figured I had nothing to loose. I appreciate that it’s helped with that and I’ve even dozed off while using!

A Mind-Body Experience
Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2023Verified Purchase
I'm a girl who loves massages. All I want for any birthday is a massage. My sister told me I should try this thing called a Shakti mat instead. I was skeptical. It looked like a gimmick, and it looked like it would hurt.But I figured, hey, why not try it? I'm so glad I did. Along with relaxing the muscles in my back, I feel a calm come over my body after about five minutes of using it. It makes me feel like I feel after an hour of meditation. I don't know why lying on plastic spikes would do that, but it does every time.So I'll conclude by saying that the Shakti mat is great for easing physical pain as well as mental/emotional stress. It's a whole mind-body experience that I'm better off for having discovered.

Purchased in Sept 2022 and it's dead in March 2023 with only moderate use by 1 person. READ ON!
Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2023Color: StoneStyle: With Concentrator & Styling BrushVerified Purchase
When I first purchased this blow dryer in September of 2022, I hesitated. I waited. I debated spending well over $200 on a blow dryer - I've *never* spent that kind of money on a blow dryer, not even on my salon-quality Babyliss dryer (which I was replacing). However, I LOVE Shark's vacuums and have been a loyal customer for 20 +/- years, so based on my experience with the brand, the purchaser reviews, and the promises from Shark about their advanced technology + avoiding damage to my fine hair - I was finally convinced and bought it. YAY, yes? Not. So. Fast.It hasn't lived up to the hype. Not even close.First, this thing is H-E-A-V-Y. And when I say it's heavy, I mean it's the kind of heavy that you need to keep this thing on your nightstand or under your pillow as a weapon against intruders. Be prepared for arm fatigue for the first six weeks of use. Your arms and hands will legit get tired as you're drying and styling your hair. My momma didn't raise a wimp, so I sucked it up and told myself that I was doing it for my locks. My dominant hand and arm are now a bit more toned as a result (bonus, I guess?). The second thing is that the controls for adjusting the strength, heat, and cold air blast just aren't located in intuitive places or operated by more intuitive controls, so even after several months of use, I found myself still having to interrupt my drying and styling to make changes that you'd think you'd be able to do on the fly after a little bit of use. NOPE. Thirdly, I purchased the option that included the concentrated nozzle and the drying/styling brush. I have fine hair that's on the straighter side, so this seemed like the appropriate option since I won't be using a diffuser. However, the tools suffer the same design flaws as the dryer itself - nothing is intuitive to use as far as your hands are concerned, so I'm constantly interrupting my drying and styling to just try to get the #$&+ tools to work for me. Switch sides of your hair? Okay - stop drying your hair, fiddle with the styling brush to change the direction of it, and then you have to rotate the brush around to find the right position and angle for that part of your head - and you have to do that every single time you move to a new section. Every single time.  Like you, I value you my sanity, so I finally just ditched the attachment tools all together because seriously friends, life is far too short for all of that hassle. It's a battle that we time-pressed users shouldn't have to engage in when you're one handed (because you're literally holding a two-ton brick of a hair dryer with one hand while simultaneously attempting to maneuver the controls and attachments with the other), and it was resulting in wasted time that we don't have. You'd think a company like Shark would have engineered all of this to be the kind of user-friendly tool that we've come to expect from the brand. But they haven't.Lastly, and here comes the worst and most insulting part: After owning this dryer for just six months and only using it a few times a week, it's suddenly started to shut off mid-blow dry + style entirely on its own. Now, you may be asking yourself why this would happen, as I did I (though I did it with some expletives because I only blow dry and style when I have somewhere to be). I can't be certain, but it seems like the unit is overheating. My filter is clean, though TBF, there's no great way to clean it. The unit doesn't open up so you can remove a filter and clean it thoroughly like you can with every other blow dryer I've ever owned. No, with this piece of modern engineering technology, you're supposed to only use something like a soft-bristled toothbrush to attempt to clean the filter from the outside, and FWIW, mine's never seemed dirty. Regardless, I've been doing that faithfully all along since I'm so used to doing it anyway, so the only thing that I can attribute it's premature demise to is that there's some kind of hardware component failure in the guts of the beast.This does have some kind of limited two year warranty through Shark, but it will have to be sent in to be serviced, and it looks like there's a charge of around $30 for this, of which I'm entirely salty about. An appliance this costly should have a manufacturer that stands behind it fully for at least a year. Add to this that it's also created the need for me to buy ANOTHER hair dryer, because my Shark HyperAIR doesn't work, and I still need a way to dry my hair for however long it's going to take to get this one shipped to them, fixed, and returned back to me. Yes, I'm cussing again.Unfortunately for Shark, this brought about a revelation, and since I love you all so much, and let's face it, you've read my review novella so you should be compensated for that effort: I discovered a hidden gem that's right here on this site and it will save you your hard earned dollars, some swears, some unnecessary workouts, and the need for a third arm when blow drying that hopefully none of you have. It's called the Remington D3190 that is also an Ionic-Ceramic Tourmaline blow dryer. It's lightweight, user friendly, fits nicely in your hand, has a THREE YEAR limited warranty, and is under...get this...twenty dollars as I'm typing my review. It actually dries my hair faster than the HyperAIR, which I think is because without all of the messing around and wasted time with controls and attachments, it's just a more efficient tool to use. Even if the price goes up to double what it costs at the time of me leaving this review, you'll still be money ahead, with nicely styled hair, and have far less exasperation in your life. You're welcome.Now, you're probably wondering what I'm going to do with my fancy (not so fancy) Shark HyperAIR after I get it back from Shark, and even if you weren't, I'm going to tell you: I'm going to get it fixed and see if I can't sell it on Marketplace or some other site. I cannot recommend it as an appliance after my absolutely horrendous user experience, and I hope to spare some of you from the same fate. It hasn't done anything to improve the quality of my hair experience in six months, though it has given me some fits. SAVE YOURSELVES. Save your sanity. Save your dollars. (Unless you're into really expensive paperweights. Then, meh, this might be for you?

The Shark Hair Blow Dryer has been a game-changer in my haircare routine. Its powerful airflow and multiple heat settings cut down drying time significantly while leaving my hair looking sleek and shiny. The ergonomic design and lightweight feel make it easy to handle, ensuring a comfortable and efficient styling experience – a must-have tool for anyone looking to achieve salon-quality results at home. The only downfall is that it is heavier than other hair dryers I have used in the oast, but that does not deter my love for it.

This is an investment for sure, but it’s a great hair dryer. Watch for sales. It’s super powerful and the 2 attachments are nice for straight hair.  It’s quite loud, like a small jet engine. But dries my hair quick.I only wish that the cool air button was a switch. I try to do the last bit if my hair on cool and it is cumbersome to have to hold the button the whole time.

I am also able to use them to pull down over my eyes to help walk out the eyes, which is a nice additional feature. I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone in a hospital or facing other noisy sleep environments.Moreover, the sound quality of these headphones is impressive.

So good I bought a second pair
Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2024Color: Purple&PurpleVerified Purchase
These are actually my second pair. I originally bought these a few years ago and loved them] until I lost them. I searched everywhere, but to no avail. When I finally decided to break down and buy another pair, I, of course, got the same ones, color and all.The band is super soft and comfortable to wear. It's tight enough to stay on my head, but loose enough so it's not squeezing me and causimg a headache. It's lightweight and made from moisture wicking fabric to help keep you cool. The headphones themselves are thin and relatively unobtrusive. You can move them around in their pockets to some extent so they're in the best spot for your head/ears.The controls aren't the easiest to use, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I'm not sure how they could've done them differently. You just have to get used to the fact that they're on the forehead, so they're backwards from normal.The sound quality is also decent. They aren't noise canceling, so you will still be able to hear ambient noise around you, and they aren't going to sound the same as high end headphones. However, they're pretty good for the price.Bluetooth is easy to set up, and the battery life is outstanding! I normally start the night off wearing these, line up some programs or videos to listen to, and then sometime later will wake up briefly to take them off. In my half asleep delirious state, I pretty much never manage to actually turn them off at that time. (Which usually throws me off the next morning when I'm drinking my coffee and catching up on news and FB, but there's no sound on the videos because I'm still paired with the headphones. 😂) Still, the battery can go several days before I have to charge them again.The Bluetooth range is also pretty impressive. It seems to have no problems staying connected even when I walk around the entire upstsirs, with the headphones somewhere in the mound of blankets and pillows where I threw them the night before.Overall, these are great headphones for their purpose. Of course, once I bought new ones, I found my original pair. So, now I have a pair in my travel bag and a pair for the house.

Good Wireless Sleep Headphones That Block Out Snoring - Wish Battery Lasted a Little Longer
Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2024Color: GreyVerified Purchase
I purchased these headphones in hopes of being able to find a way to block my husband's loud snoring noises. It worked perfectly for that purpose, but I was slightly disappointed to find out that the battery only lasts between 6-7 hours before it needs a new charge. Because I usually go to bed around 10pm, the battery generally seems to run out somewhere between 4-5am.As far as comfort goes, I have no complaints at all. The fabric of the headband is soft and breathable and the build in wireless speakers were thin enough that they did not bother me at all (even when sleeping on my side). I also found the bluetooth connection process to be pretty straight forward and I have had no issue pairing the headphones to several different devices. Lastly, I thought that the volume levels and the quality of the sound were both relatively good, especially considering the price that these headphones are being sold for.So, overall, I would say that these headbands are a good purchase, but I do wish the battery lasted slightly longer than they do. With that said, I am planning on purchasing two more for my teenage sons who were also impressed when I let them try them out!

We purchased this a couple of months ago (with our own money, no communication with or compensation from the company) as our old 43"" 720p flatscreen was starting to give out and have problems with the picture.  We wanted to downsize a bit given the space in our living room, and didn't want to spend a lot of money for a TV with a ton of features that we weren't going to use.  We did our research and settled on this 32"" Vizio as it had integrated Chromecasting (which we use every day) and a sharper picture than our old set without taking up a lot of room.After using it for a while now, we've got a pretty good idea of the ins and outs of this TV and how it works for our viewing habits.  Some pros and cons:PROS:Sharp screen/picture quality - granted, it's not 4K/8K/etc., but it's quite a step up from the 720p screen we were used to.  Even though it's much smaller size-wise, shows and movies are noticeably better.  It does take some adjusting through the settings to find your ideal viewing settings; there are a few different settings for different use cases like gaming, and turning off the motion setting improved things for us as well, but make sure you play around with them to find what looks best to your eyes.Size and weight - it's featherweight compared to our old TV, very easy to mount and adjust and get where you want it without a lot of strain or stress.Inputs - you've got two HDMIs (one with ARC for using a soundbar), a USB port for powering something like a Roku, an antenna input and some various audio ins/outs.  Unless you're looking for a plethora of input/outputs, this will do the job for the average person out there.  Especially given the price, it would make a great secondary TV for a kids' playroom or similar location where you want to have one available but don't want to sink a lot of money into extraneous features.Built-in Chromecasting - this is a great included feature, and frees up one of the HDMI inputs that we were using on our old set for a 2nd Gen Chromecast.  We ran into a problem with this initially that I'll talk about below, but it seems to have smoothed itself out somehow.The Vizio TV app - we have Android phones and I really like the Vizio app for controlling the TV (switching inputs, scrolling through Netflix/Hulu, etc.).  We have a cable box that can also scroll through inputs but not other settings, but for cord cutters or people who don't want to bother with a few different remotes the app connects quickly and reliably to allow you to control things.WatchFree - I just started scrolling through the included free movies and shows last night, and there's a good selection to watch.  Granted, if you're using other streaming services then you might either run into duplicates or option overload, but it's nice that Vizio gives you some extra choices for viewing when you purchase their TVs with this feature.Streaming apps - we use our phones and Chromecasting to watch Netflix/Hulu/etc., but you have a bunch of apps that you can load onto the TV itself and use in place of your phone if you so choose.  Better to have more options in this respect than fewer, I figure.CONS:The speakers - they're not great, our old TV was more powerful but we've gotten used to them at this point.  We thought about getting a cheap soundbar but decided against it.  Just know that for the price, you're not getting an audio powerhouse.  You can link a soundbar up multiple ways (look at the user manual online for instructions) if you require sharper sound.  It can get plenty loud, it's just that the quality overall isn't fantastic.  We don't watch a lot of stuff where we'd need super-high-def sound, so it works fine for us.  They're down-firing rather than forward-firing, which may have something to do with it.Chromecasting - I haven't had any problems at all, but my wife's phone wouldn't connect reliably for a while.  We plugged in our old Chromecast for her to connect to, and now she hasn't had any problems with either the built-in or external Chromecast.  I'm not sure what did the trick, but I'm not going to question a miracle.  She found online that other have had problems with reliable built-in Chromecasting, but given our experience YMMV.  I made sure that the TV connected to our WiFi with a static address to isolate that variable, but the only thing that seemed to work was the solution above.The picture settings - there are a few different default settings for things like gaming, motion enhancement, etc.  It can be a bit to go through in order to find your perfect setting(s), but if it's not looking great at first just try playing around with those settings.  I thought I was going to have to return it because the picture was a little dark around the edges and the motion enhancement was driving me nuts, but luckily I decided to play around with things and voila - I haven't messed around with the picture settings since the first week we got it.  It'd just be nice to have it start with a more common 'default' setting rather than one that's supposed to give you a great picture but in reality is just full of supposed enhancements in color, motion, contrast, etc.All in all, I think it's a great TV for the price.  It's got enough extras to cover the bases for most people and use cases if you're looking for a TV at this size and price range, without a bunch of stuff you'll never use.  It sets up quickly in terms of getting it out of the box, upright, and plugged in in order to use without having to go through a phonebook-sized manual (anyone remember phonebooks?) to figure it out.  The phone app is also very helpful and easy to set up, and I'd recommend this TV to others looking for the same thing we were.

Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024Size: 40 inchStyle: 1080pPattern: Smart TVVerified Purchase
Didn’t want a ginormous TV, no space for it.  Searched for long time at Best Buy, Costco and Amazon for a 40” TV that would fit on my etagere shelf.  Not all TV measurements are the same, you have to consider height with the stand.  This Vizio 40” with the stand fit perfectly into my shelf space width wise, about 2” to spare in width and height, and 2” was just enough to allow for angle adjustments.  My other existing and prior TV’s are all Vizio and I am quite happy with the Sony brand. I am using a Roku device and everything works great!  Very happy with it so far.  I’ll update my review later if there’s any problem.  I also purchased the extended warranty just in case. In my decision process, other criteria that I factored in is that Amazon would deliver to my doorstep, therefore I would not have to drive anywhere, look for or wait for assistance, or ask for help at home to carry or drag it in from my SUV.  That was a big plus!  I only wish I had bought it sooner.

Who can resist upgrading at this low price? This is a great value on a beautiful smart TV. My wife and I are in our 70's. We had difficulty reading captions on or old 24"" TV. Problem solved! I completed the install with a little help from our caregivers. We purchased a mounting kit with an extension arm for our bedroom. This enables us to fold the TV against the wall when not in use, and easily extend the set for viewing. I plugged in our Amazon Fire Stick with no problems. The numerous streaming services included with this TV will expand our viewing options. We plugged in a new DVD player and our DVD library has been revived with a 40"" picture. We are thoroughly delighted! Although... We have several remote-controlled accent lamps in the bedroom. The remotes for the lamps interfere with the TV remote. Ho hum. We are still exploring lighting solutions. Meanwhile... Pink Floyd rocks in 40"" splendor!

I have not worn a watch in 13 years but a ""smart"" watch has interested me so I thought I would try one.  I decided to purchase this one which seemed to have a lot of features, especially for the price.  I am very impressed!  I use this watch for it's obvious abilities....date, time, etc.  The additional features though are a lot of fun and very useful.  It monitors health and sleep.  I use the ""find my phone"" often because I set my phone down in forgotten locations and need to find it.  This watch tracks my steps and distance.  When I am hiking it does the tracking automatically.  The phone feature works surprisingly well. I am especially impressed since I have difficulty with my hearing.  It has good volume and it is very clear and easy to understand.  I am able to view emails, notifications and messages and prioritize them from the watch.  It syncs with Alexa and my music apps easily.  I am very happy with this purchase and recommend this watch!

My First Smart Watch, I Love It!
Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2024Color: BlackVerified Purchase
First off, this is the most comfortable watch I have owned in the last 40 year's.I never had a smart watch before and this one, though relatively simple to operate, it has lots of features I didn't know I was interested in.  I am old and my heart rate is important to me, as well as my blood oxygen level. It is nice to have them handy if I feel ""weird"" for some reason.  The remote camera access for my phone camera has come in handy for setting up a shot and triggering it from my watch. Helps the picture because I have a tendency to not hold still when clicking a shot.  I like the phone alerts sent to my watch as well. I don't usually carry my phone around with me and have missed many timely messages. This watch is helping me be more responsive when it is important.  The phone has more features and I am sure I will get to know them better as time goes on.

Great Affordable Watch
Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2024Verified Purchase
This is my first experience with a smart watch for myself, but my wife has had one for years.  Since I wasn’t sure if I’d use it I wasn’t willing to spend hundreds of dollars for one of the big name brand watches, like my wife has, and I’m happily surprised just how capable this one is.  While my wife’s watches have all cost about 10 times what this one did, the only feature I can find that this one is missing is the ability to type out a response to a text from the watch.  This watch does a great job of giving you quick access to your messages and notifications, letting you answer or make a call, control media playing on your phone, control home automation devices through Alexa, and monitor your health with a surprisingly full suite of capabilities.

Good For The Price
Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
I have been searching for an affordable fitness tracker watch. When I came across this one I figured I'd give it a try. It looks good on my wrist and had no issues connecting to my phone but there are a couple things to note.First of all, once it is connected, if you go out of range of it your phone will continuously try to connect to it. Also phone calls were problematic because it keeps overriding the mode I choose to talk on to switch it back to the watch. For instance, if I want to talk through the phone, the phone/app keeps switching it back to talking through the watch.Another thing is that it is really uncomfortable on my wrist.As far as recording metrics goes, it works fine. There is some setup between the app and the watch. Some of the setup I had to figure out on my own too.Overall, its just an ok fitness tracker. But for the price, it might be worth it if you're looking for something to start with.

The best mini fire pit ever!
Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2023Size: MesaColor: BoneVerified Purchase
My wife bought the mini fire pit for me for Christmas last year.  I thought it would be worthless, but I was dead wrong!  It was the best gift I ever had!  Thank to my sweet lady for this wonderful gift.  I lives in the city where there is no fireplace allowed and a big heavy fine.  So, this is perfect.  It's sat on my picnic table, easy fired it up, and watch the flame soar high and dance away in the air.  Wow!  No smoke at all!  And I even can feel the warmth came from it.  Beautiful!  We had a Fourth of July back yard party and my oldest son know I have one so he grabbed it and set it up.  My whole family love it, they keep added more woods to it and still enjoyed it for hours!  I never thought my whole family hooked to the mini fire pit that quick!  Two months ago, I bought Mesa XL so I can give my first mesa to my grandson for his apartment with smallest back yard.  He and his girlfriend loved it!  She said it was the best fire pit she ever enjoyed it every time my grandson lit it up.  He said it fit perfectly in his back yard and always bring it in once it was completely cooled.  They don't want any of his next door neighbors take it and use it.  Even their landlord loved it too!  They are very protective about their mini fire pit.  I thought it was odd but hey!  We all love Mesa and Mesa XL!  One time last spring, I took it with me to my brother country home and set it up on the low end table.  Once I got it going, my brother freaked out!  He said it like a blow torch in there.  I laughed so hard.  He never thought the flame would shoot high and dance away.  He find it interesting.  He asked me, did they make a big one too?  I told him yes!

Neat little fire pit

Small but will work good for RV camping for a small little fire !! Easy to clean out and don’t take up much space. We carry some small blocks of wood from home .. Works fine for just a small fire !!

Nice Compact Fireplace
Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2024Size: Mesa XLColor: Stainless SteelVerified Purchase
This compact fireplace is perfect for tabletop or patio use. It burns wood pellets and one loading of pellets lasts about 45 minutes. It provides a fair amount of heat and there is no smoke and very little ash when it has completed burning.

Mesa XL
Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2024Size: Mesa XLColor: GunmetalVerified Purchase
Glad I got the XL, can't imagine how small the regular is. Shipped thru FedEx directly from solo stove so there was no tracking but arrived 3 days later, prime member. Ships only in product solo stove box so don't leave out for porch pirates.Has the pellet adapter built into it, no way to remove it. No idea how to clean ash out besides turning it upside down. Overall construction seems sturdy and well made, no seams split or holes frayed.I got the heat deflector also, the ring that comes with the mesa XL has to be removed for the heat deflector to sit securely.I see no drain holes so I do not recommend leaving this out in the rain.Photo of it reverse stacked is to only to show radius of deflector is about 1.5 inches bigger than Mesa so it won't take up any more table top space.Overall happy with it upon unboxing. Will be great on the patio table or to bring to outdoor social events, personally would like it bigger but then you would lose the table use and may as well get a full size bonfire.

Great little intimate tabletop fire pit.  Super on a little table on my deck.  No heat whatsoever goes down to the tabletop, and it comes with a stand.  The stand doesn’t even get hot.  Great flame, easy to use, nice heat.  A little wood-hungry, but you just need (a lot of) small blocks and a firestarter. Super purchase.

Great looking bootie,  runs a bit small returning & ordered a half size larger.
Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023Size: 8.5Color: Camel Brown, BlackVerified Purchase
These are so cute, once they finally did arrive. I wanted to wear these on my Christmas vacation, but shipping was greatly delayed. Fortunately the snow and rain did not materialize as forecasted. Just picked up at the poat office on my return home and they are really, really cute. I love them.  And they make my feet look so small. I wear an 8.5 and they are exactly that with only a tiny bit of room to the tip of my toes. But after trying them on for a little while I could tell they were already hurting my toes even with thin socks on. Tried some arch support inserts to see if they would help, but am returning the 8.5 pair for a size 9. I hope they won't be too big, I think they will be okay with a regular or thicker sock which may be needed for warmth as they are not quite as padded inside as I thought they might be.  They do have some padding, just not as thick as I thought Sorel boots may usually be. I have never tried or owned any Sorel boots before. If they fit I believe they will be comfortable and very functional.  I may order another pair, or maybe even two in another color(s) since I do live way up North in snow country and they are so good looking.

Cute but not the same quality or sizing as earlier pair
Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2024Size: 8.5Color: Camel Brown, BlackVerified Purchase
I bought this boot (different color pattern) last year and loved them. Thought I'd get a second back-up pair in a different color/pattern. Bought the same size in this color pattern and they did not fit the same as my previous pair. Also does not appear to be the same quality. These were about 1/2 size smaller. The boot itself is really cute and I LOVE my older pair which are surprisingly warm, lightweight, and very comfy right out of the box. Thought I'd buy a second pair (before they got discontinued) but apparently the quality varies with the sizing so I am sticking with my one older pair for now.

Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2024Size: 6Color: Camel Brown, BlackVerified Purchase
I really want to give this a 5 star since it it cute and it is waterproof (why i really bought it). I used it on my trip to London and it really kept my feet dry. However, it is not as comfortable as I thought it would be. Since the toes part of the shoes is made of rubber, that part tends to get cold. The other part are super warm though. Also, the part where you put the laces have rouch stitching and it scratches my feet so I had to wear thicker socks which made it feel very thight around my ankles. Also, it may appear as though it has good arch support, but it doesn't. I used it only for shorter walks and not for longer walks cause it really made my feet hurt.

amazing I loved it and got faster times on it very quickly.
Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2022Verified Purchase
its amazing how much better a good cube can make you! this is a amazing cube especially for the price. 30 d0llars may seem a bit hefty for a Rubik's cube but when you get it you see where the money went. it is fast maneuverable any easy to handle.durability is quite good but be careful not to drop it. I dropped it on hardwood and it damaged it slightly but not to big of a deal. but the one thing I will say is this is not a beginner cube because of the price this is for people who can solve the cube and want a better one or have a cube collection and want a good 3x3 for the collection. I did some tests and here are the results for me.( I'm reviewing this product about 4 months after purchase ) before the gan I averaged about 35 to 40 seconds with a few 29 second personal bests. when I got this I dropped to around 35 seconds only no 40 second solves. after about 2 months I was consistently getting under 35 seconds to 25 seconds setting my personal best at 25 seconds. 4 months later with a lot of practice mind you I am now always under 30 seconds and have a personal best of 19 seconds. this cube has done wonders for me and improved my cubing hobby. highly recommend. however most of that skill increase was via practice and learning new algorithms the cube did help me quite a bit. my only complaint is that in order to keep the cube functional and healthy a large amount of lube and lots of cleaning. I use a tooth brush to clean it and a rag and I use speed cube shop martian lube and weight 6.i can say with confidence that this is the best cube I own. and I hope my review helped you to decide if you want this cube. happy cubing!!  :)

Finish is nice and overall nice construction. I would have no problem paying for this cube again. This is the best cube for the price IMO.Cons- The 365M is a very good cube, but it leaves something to be desired. I find myself overshooting with it quite a bit and once you get moving fast just doesn't move the way you want it to.

My 9yo daughter is now trying to learn and has been frustrated trying to learn on the old clunky Rubik's so I bought another GAN so I can teach her at the same time.  Very smooth turns and is very quick.  Mine shows zero signs of wear and has been dropped a few times with no issues.  I would definitely suggest this 3x3 to anyone who doesnt know where to begin when looking for a first speed cube.

Very cute. My sisters kids loved them (or were very polite and good actors) but they were not random in my case.I bought two and they had the exact same five toys in each. Out of a supposed twenty options in the picture in the description thats pretty a pretty big coincidence.At least I don't have to worry about them fighting over a favorite. So if you’re buying two maybe buy from different stores as the stock wasn't very shuffled in this instance.But they’re soft and cute so great gift it buying one.

After reading reviews, I was terrified I was going to receive a dupe product instead of an official Stanley tumbler. I not only have sought after a quality large tumbler to help my water intake regularly, but the name Stanley has personal meaning to me as well, though I won't delve into how here. The tumbler I received is 100% genuine. I checked the screws in the handle, handle location, and the small inner logo at the bottom of the inside. Thrilled, I went ahead and decorated it (Cream 2.0 Color) with accessories I purchased separately to go with it. I seriously couldn't be happier. It's so beautiful and stands out so well in a way my old tumbler did not. It keeps my water COLD with ice. Due to standing out, I'm less likely to forget to drink water as I typically do, because I'll be constantly finding myself admiring the aesthetics, which will remind me. (I'm ADHD and this is a thing for me.)The straw is wider open than other straws I'm used to but I actually love that, for uninterrupted liquid flow as well as practical use cases. I did purchase some other straws to try out with it, but loved the original straw so much that I've decided to just stick with that for now. The handle has such a smooth, silky feel to it, with a wonderful grip that makes holding it oh so comfortable. I already had been using a 40 oz tumbler prior to this, for several months, so I'm used to the heft with and without liquid/ice/etc inside. I don't plan on using it for heated beverages, just water/water flavorings, so I can't speak to the efficacy of its warmth mechanism(s). The lid screws on perfectly tightly and the straw to open middle part requires a good bit of force to turn, meaning there won't be any accidental shifts to worry about just casually bumping into it or carrying it around. The construction overall is extremely sturdy.Even if it wasn't hyped, even if it suddenly became the world's worst/most hated cup of all time come tomorrow morning, this is a fantastic product I am already thoroughly enjoying and will continue to do so for as long as it will last me, hopefully years to come. Order one if you want to be temporarily considered 'cool' or whatever, sure, but definitely order one if you want a quality beverage companion at your side at all times that actually lives up to its reputation.

A great cup/tumbler for staying hyrdrated while sitting at a desk or running errands in the car
Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024Style: 40 ozColor: EucalyptusVerified Purchase
I think this is a great option for staying hydrated throughout the day if you work long hours at a desk and don't want to get up frequently to refill your cup with water or ice. It does keep the ice cold for a long time, as long as you put a lot of cubes in there to start with. I usually toss at least 8 or 9 cubes in, or around 1/3 of the cup.It is quite large and unweildy and leaks quite easily, so personally I wouldn't really carry it around anywhere outside the house, except for car errands. If you are driving and running errands, it fits well in a cup holder.The straw is easy to sip from, and so it can be quite soothing to sip some ice cold water while working and focusing on something.The bottom of the cup is kind of loud when you put it on the table, so I got a silicone boot/coaster for it, and to protect that lead pellet from any sort of damage! lol If you have a wobbily surface, it will tip over and start leaking! It's a little top heavy by design.I've found it pretty easy to clean. It hasn't gotten dirty very easily. I only use it for water.While the product doesn't really blow my mind, it is aesthetically pleasing and gets the job done. It's a little pick me up or a shiny object to look at on your desk while you are working. It does come in handy for long work days.

Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2024Style: 40 ozColor: Rose QuartzVerified Purchase
I bought this quencher for my birthday since I dont have any thermal cups and it works so good. It keeps everything cold/hot for the whole day and I love the big handle and small bottom so it can fit into cup holders. The only thing I dont like is for the price you excpect to not pay for anything extra, but you still have to if you want it to not spill unless you're not that clumsy, unlike me. I would recemend paying for spill proof acessories that do mostly come with a straw stopper but you can buy a cute decorative one to go with your cup, and if you have school, get the silicone stopper thingys at the bottom so it wont fall if you put it on a slanted desk or anywhere. i bought that in a pink color so it goes with my stanley color and aesthetic and they are definetly game changers, but I hope they just atleast make the cups spill proof so all u need to buy is decrotive accesories and the bottom spill stoper. They could add just also add silicone stuff at the bottom but that just wont be as effective i feel like because no other cup brand has that. Overall worth the 45 plus tax if you want good quality plus aesthetically cute. ALSO make sure to take out every single part possible to get a thurough clean!

The tumbler keeps things hot, warm or cold very well.  I LOVE the ""straw"".  It is larger than usual straws provided with these types of mugs/cups/tumblers.  It still leaks a little when the straw is removed from the ""hole"" in the top.  Pretty colors.  I like it has a screw top and I can position it appropriately to have the straw be on the side that I want it.  A little more expensive than I usually pay, but it is worth it.

Keeps drinks cold for a long time. Still ice the next day.
Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2024Style: 20 ozColor: Black GlowVerified Purchase
This is a really good tumbler. It keeps my ice water cold for at least a day, if I just fill it and leave it.It's not too difficult to clean, but it feels like it might break easier than I would like to remove the top seal. The lid is also too tall to comfortably drink out of. Nit sure why they made the rim of the lid so tall, but it makes it hard to drink from without using the straw, which I prefer not to use. It's also not as leak proof as others that have a real seal-able lid.

I love these lil patches so much! I often break out due to seasonal changes / coming in to contact with stuff that just irritates my skin and these patches work wonders. They’re easy to use and have lasted me for atleast 4 months. I’ve been able to cut the stars in half and place them in more angular places on my face such as above the lip or above the eyebrow.I highly recommend these! Just make sure to apply them when your skin is free of excess moisture because they will fall off easier in humidity / moisturized skin.

For starters, they do not work at all. They’re good for preventing acne picking, but they do nothing for the zit itself.  They sell XL ones that don’t have with the cute case, those ones work way better but even then just in covering your acne and staying in your skin. Unless you have like a tiny zit that nobody can see anyway, these will not cover the whole thing AND they fall off within two hours, especially if you’re prone to oily skin. Good for the case, but I get the XL ones and put them in here instead.

I love these boots. I bought them in a 9,5 even though I am normally a 10. The fit is superb, the colour goes with anything from black tights to jeans. The day they arrived I put them on and wore them for hours that is how comfortable they are. Note, as they are suded and thus prone to staining I would waterproof them first to minimise scuffing.These boots turn alot of heads, simple in design yet elegant on the leg. Well made, Highly recommended. I waited for the sales to be able to afford them. They are well worth thr price as they never date I will be able to wear them for many seasons.

This is my 2nd pair of Stewart Weitzman 50/50  boots! This time I got them in Black Suede at a huge blowout price! And they are of course authentic! Im good at sewing so I will also add a zipper all the way down on the inner side of the boots  so it doesn’t stress out the fabric on the back of the boots when you’re pulling them on . and it’s easier to get in and out of them with a zipper! ( I added a zipper to my first pair) happy with purchase.These boots also have a roomy toe box without looking too wide. In fact I have wide feet and these are medium width they are extra comfy can wear them all day. It’s probably because they are leather inside and out! Almost forgot to mention that the shipper did pack the box with extra care so my Stewart Weitzman box came in perfect condition.

They asked me to provide the style code stamped near the top of the inside shaft and about a day later confirmed my pair IS authentic, from their fall 2017 run. Great customer service. If you have doubts get them, jot down the code and contact the company directly.Last Saturday night I watched Atomic Blonde. A week and change later I am the PROUD owner of the 5050 she ROCKED in that fight scene. Whoa, wow and OMG. OK, OK. I read the reviews. I asked the questions I'm going to do my best to answer for you now. Let's do this:I received my boots in the purple box. I received the dust bag. My boots arrived today new and pristine, factory packed and properly stuffed with no creases in the leather. I checked the soles: Made in Spain. I had to peer down the shaft a bit to see the SW stamp but there it was, clean and crisp. I have the napa leather and it's like butter--soft but not TOO soft; it feels like it can stand up to daily street action. I can see how our heroine in Atomic Blonde kicked much arse in these and still looked fab.About me: 5'2. 110lbs. Lean build, no exceptional leg proportions. Size 9 shoe; I don't know why I have such big feet on such a small frame but that's just life and genetics. And 45, if you must know. If you've studied pics of this boot you know the shaft hits differently on different people. I learned manufacturers cut the length of the boot shaft in proportion to the shoe size, which they base on the height of the average woman who wears that size: so if you're a size 5 shoe, manufacturers cut the shaft to fit a height around 5 feet or so--hence if your shoe size is disproportionate to your height, you may find boot shafts hit you differently than advertised. I followed advice and sized .5 down to the 8.5B and it is PERFECT on me, even with a thick sock. The shaft is where things get interesting. On me, thanks to my big hoofs, this boot hits well above the knee, a couple inches or so--high enough that on me this is thigh high. No more feening for Lowlands for this chick! But this higher rise also means the stretch back hits much higher on my leg than designed--above the bend of my knee--so sitting and bending are not the most comfortable at present; this may resolve with some break in. I also felt a little rubbing/irritation around the front of my knee where the leather in front is sort of, I dunno--seamed or folded inside or whatever. And yes, there was a bit of bagging around the ankles but no big deal.The rounded toe shape works for me and is part of what makes these so wearable--no crowding, all badarse walkability for days. Footbed is super comfortable and the shoe does not rub or chafe my toes anywhere. People wear these with jeans; I tried them on bare legs. They are snug. I tried them over the jeans I was wearing today too, which are skinny but not SUPER skinny. Not a good look. These babies want your skinniest skinnies. Keep them tight to the ankles to minimize extra bagging at the ankles.You will look luxe. You will feel luxe. These rule. If you're into these, Prime them and see for yourself if it's love for you, too.

A special pair of boots
Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2014Verified Purchase
This style from Stuart Weitzman has been around for some time. I've always been interested in trying them and Amazon's sale put them in my price range. I was not disappointed. I've many pairs of boots and these are unique. The boot shaft hugs my leg like no other pair of boots. The elastic back is superior to any I've seen in cheaper knock-offs. The flat heel and roomy toe box make it great for all day wear. The only down side is that the height of the boot makes them difficult to wear under jeans. The top of the boot creates a ridge in your jeans just above your knee. They are too good to return so I'm going to have to find a really skinny pair of jeans to wear with them. Thank you Amazon

Ain't nothing like the real thing
Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2013Size: 7.5Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I feel kind of like a tool for buying $600 boots, and maybe I'm trying extra super hard to rationalize my purchase, but even so, I love these boots! I had my eye on the 5050 for a while. I know they're a celeb favorite, I only saw about a million images of Kate Moss and Olivia Palermo and Angelina Jolie wearing them. I only pulled the trigger after I saw a total stranger in Whole Foods wearing these boots (I almost chased her down to ask her how she liked her 5050s, but that would've been too weird). I tried the Vince Camuto and Franco Sarto knock-offs, thinking they'd scratch my itch for the 5050s, but they just don't compare in quality and fit--once I got these boots and tried them on I knew they were mine mine mine. I got the black suede. They fit so much better around the ankle and shaft for a sleeker fit, and the suede is so beautiful. They're surprisingly versatile boots, and look just as good worn casually with my Target clearance rack skirts as they do with my better skirts and dresses for work. I was a hesitant about being able to pull off the over-the-knee look, but I don't dress like Beyonce, so it's not an issue. I'm still in the honeymoon phase with the 5050s, and wear them at every opportunity, but I know I'll love 'em and wear 'em forever.

I was thinking about these boots for a couple of years. Read great reviews and finally bought the boots. I was very surprised that the boots are not that great. The quality is good but they do not look that flattering on my feet. I think they are a way too overpriced. I previously had very similar boots by Vince Camoto which were more comfortable and much less expensive. Big disappointment

Brought me a more positive outlook
Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2023Color: Blue with gold foilingVerified Purchase
Are you someone who does not have time to journal but wants to bring a more positive and grateful mindset everyday. Then this is for you. Try it!It really only takes 5 minutes. You can time it. It has two parts a morning section and night section. The morning has three entries and night has two entries to fill in. There are weekly challenges that show up on the pages that are fun but not too time consuming.For me I did it as the first thing in the morning BEFORE touching my phone. At night I was less strict and did it whenever it fit in my night schedule. My piece of advice is you can do it however you want as long as you do it everyday no matter if it’s a good day or a bad day.Personally it was a slow change, it was hard for me to come up with things to write but after two weeks I started to see my day differently. It was more positive and I felt more grateful for things. I noticed things in my day that should write down. Took time to enjoy them. There is a entry that says “what would make today great”. That for me was the hardest. I did not know what I could do that would make that day great.  But it brought me more in tune with myself for that day and what I needed. Sometimes I wrote things down in that section and did not do them, other times I made sure to do all the things. It taught me a deeper more authentic version of self care. Doing things you need to do to feel better, more centered, happy etc. For example instead of “ go to the gym” it’s” if I move my body today” or instead of “ I will clean the kitchen today” it’s “ I will spend x amount of time cleaning my space today. It’s a small commitment to yourself for that day. It made me more kind to myself. Not an chore or something to dread doing. But a small commitment to better yourself. I know I read somewhere that’s you should be 1% better everyday and I believe this helps you do that.Good luck!In terms of quality it great. The cover, the pages the color. All great. Just like it’s pictured. However mine did start to fall apart after a couple months. I think this would make a great gift to yourself or someone else.As with most things if you don’t take it seriously ot can’t make the commitment it won’t help you.

Great journal
Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2022Color: Sunshine YellowVerified Purchase
What I love about this journal is the beautiful sunshine yellow color of the journal as well as the soft material on the hard cover. Most of the pages in the journal are the same prompts with different quotes and some actionable items to take for some days. It does force you to start your day thinking positive if you use the book according to the instructions on the first pages. It has caused me too look into my like with more of an abundance mindset and focus on what I do have going for me as opposed to what I am unhappy with. That being said this particular journal is not a need you could write the same prompts in your normal journal and get the same effect.What I don't love is the binding... pages fell out as soon as I opened it!! Might be better as a spiral notebook. Should be constructed way better considering the price. Not sure that I will repurchase for this reason, when I can just follow the prompts in a blank note book.

Once upon a time, I was a prolific journaler. Writing has helped me process so much… and then things got bad enough that I stopped writing because of I wrote, I would have to face reality.

This couch is absolutely awesome and my kids LOVE it! The cushions are firm but the perfect thickness/ give for them to jump and crash onto them. The number of pieces and different shapes makes for lots of play options. Definitely give it a day or two to inflate after opening form the packaging, and to air out. A great option if you don’t want to spend as much for a Nugget!

Excellent neck support for travel
Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2024Color: BlackVerified Purchase
This neck support is perfect for maintaining good neck posture on planes, trains, or any other form of travel. The fabric is soft and the design works for any neck size. It does not mess hairstyles or clothing. It comes in its on travel bag but would easily fit in a handbag. For anyone with neck pain, this support would be wonderful for at-home use. I have used it in the late evenings when I tend to nod off. It protects my neck from falling over causing even more trauma and pain. With the consent of a doctor, I think this item would be useful in the later stages of neck surgery recovery. I highly recommend this neck support!

Easy to transport, comfort varies
Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2024Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I used this on my first international round trip last summer (mid-US to Germany and back). Our travel guide recommended these. This does help simulate side sleeping a little, which suits me.Pros: Its portability is amazing, and the support - if positioned just right on the neck - is fairly decent and beats any neck pillows I've tried on shorter trips. If one wants to change positions, they only need to rotate the trtl. Easy to wash.Cons: Comfort was a mixed bag. One could certainly do worse, but my neck quickly became stiff and somewhat restricted (I'm 5'8"", not sure if this matters). I was also in economy, which could've colored my experience. I did manage to sleep a little. A milder issue was the velcro had a tendency to stick to some articles of clothing and items.

the neck pillow to get, if you hate neck pillows
Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024Color: Black/GreyVerified Purchase
I recently had a 9 hour flight that began at midnight and was concerned that my current U-shaped neck pillow wouldn’t cut it. I absolutely hate using those on flights; they are always too bulky to fit in a personal item properly, they get warm really fast, and I never found the fit to be particularly great (never really liked memory foam pillows or mattresses in the first place.) This alleviated all of those issues. The pillow and travel pouch are light and small, easy enough to fit in a bag under the seat so it’s accessible when you need it. The pillow is a lot firmer than memory foam, but still padded enough to be comfortable.  And once you manage to get a good placement around your neck, you can put the full weight of your head over to one side. It’s very nice, I thought.  There’s a bit of a learning curve but once you get the placement right you will forget that it’s even around your neck.I had my fiancée try it for a little bit, but she still prefers the U-shaped ones. She likes softer feeling pillows, meanwhile with those I find myself sinking into the memory foam and getting warm quickly.TL;DR: If you are a fan of firm mattresses/pillows, hate memory foam, or just found that those other neck pillows never worked for you, I would give this one a shot!

Stopped Using the Trtl - I'm 5'9"", 150lbs - Used 10+ trips
Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2019Color: GreyVerified Purchase
I travel for work 10-12 weeks a year, about a quarter of which is international.  Five-star reviews are rare for me. I reserve that rating for near perfect items.  4 stars IMO, is damn good.I have used the Trtl on at least 10 trips / 20+ flights.Travel - 4 stars (Very Good)The Trtl fits extremely well in any travel bag I'd imagine.  I use a Timbuk2 Authority as my primary carry-on and the Trtl tucks in very nicely without taking up too much space.  This makes it easy to stow your bag under the seat on planes, pillow included.Support - 3 Stars (Good)Support is where I started to have issues with the Trtl.  This could be a result of my size and personal comfort preferences as well, so be advised.  I am 5'9"", 150lbs, and comfortably wear a 14.5 inch neck in dress shirts.  I found that I had to wrap the Trtl fairly tight around my neck in order for the support to be effective.  If I tried to loosen the wrap for more comfort, the brace would slide down my shoulder - which led me to have to try and ""shrug"" my shoulders to keep the brace pressed to my face.  In this situation, the Trtl is neither supportive or comfortable.  This may not be an issue for someone with broader shoulders or a thicker / more muscular build.  For me, finding the sweet spot between feeling like I was in ""traction"" and ""resting"" on a pillow was difficult.Comfort - 2 Stars (Disappointing)FIRST ISSUEThe struggles with support contribute to my rating for comfort.  In achieving the ""good"" support, the Trtl became uncomfortable for me.  Imagine pulling a turtle neck up high to the bottom of your ears and covering your chin.  If you have no problem with that for however many hours you want to rest on the pillow - this shouldn't bother you.  For me, this quickly led to me feeling hot / stuffy / and restricted.  The material breathes well enough, but airplanes are stuffy and poorly vented in my experiences, which made using the Trtl feel like sleeping in bed with the covers pulled up over your face.SECOND ISSUEUsing the Trtl while sitting tightly packed in economy wasn't fun.  I'm a small guy, and the act of having to extend and wrap the Trtl around my neck, velcro it properly, and adjust it made me brush up against my fellow passengers.  I found myself trying to couch over in my seat to put this on if I had people sitting next to me on a plane.  No one next to you, no problem.  Flying business or first class, no problem - though the pillows there are way better than the Trtl.  Don't forget your own pillow case.THIRD ISSUEI like to wear wireless earbuds (Jabra Elite 65t).  The Trtl interferes with the seating of the wireless earbud in my ear, either pressing it or tugging it out.  This can happen with traditional travel pillows as well, but with those designs, you can push the pillow in slightly different positions to avoid this.  I didn't have the same issue with over the ear headphones, but using them is not my preference.  If you use Apple earbuds, this could be an issue.Overall -  a good product, well built, and easy to travel with.  Ultimately wasn't a good fit for me and my specific use case, but your mileage may vary.  I hope this helps!

Absolutely love it. A long time ago saw an influencer I like talking ab it and I bought it right away. Took it on FOUR 14+ hours international flights. Give u more support than ur regular pillow. I also bought two for my parents they love it as well.One downside is, if you like big over the headphones, this pillow wrap would kinda get in the way and u have to move around the headphone and the pillow wrap for adjustment and it’s not the most comfortable feeling sometimes, so be aware.Another thing is, their new technology with the magic tap is great, avoiding most of the material from getting caught on, not with Kashmir tho so be careful; also the magic tap on mine kinda stop being sticky after I washed it once, still words but not as strong.

💖 5*’s❗️My 5th pair of UGG SLIPPERS - ALL RUN SMALL though!
Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2022Verified Purchase
I don’t wear any footwear that isn’t UGG! I’m normally a size 8 1/2 M in other brands, but a 9 in every pair of UGG’s I have, which includes not only the slippers (various styles), but the boots, and shoes. I’ve had 5 foot surgeries and ever since it’s been very hard for me to find a brand that I can actually walk in for more than 30 minutes before my foot hurts. I also have very bad arthritis in my hands and fingers, so I can’t wear shoes with laces that need to be tied. These are easy to slide into without having to bend down or hold the slippers in one hand and use the other one to push my foot in (contrary to what someone else wrote about this). The backs come about 1 1/2 “ above the bottom of my feet, and the inner lining is very plush and soft. The stitches around the top have a design and are trimmed in white (I think it gives them a little ‘extra’ classy, nice touch), and they’re straight, not sloppy looking. From the bottom of the soles to where the suede begins from around 3/4” in the front, and gradually increases to a high of 1 1/2” in the back. Then there is more stitching. This is the first time I bought this style and it’s a perfect fit (if you’re usually a ‘1/2’ size, go to the higher one, not down!), plus so comfortable and warm (I have poor circulation too in my legs and feet, so I’m always cold, esp  in the winter!) I’m not one to skimp on paying the cost of ANY product that’s good quality, made well, and will last me a long time! ***If you have any slip-on UGG  slippers and the linings wear out over time, you can buy new ones (don’t have to be UGG brand either - I’ve bought other brands to replace the originals and preferred the unknown ones, plus they’re a lot cheaper!). I can’t recommend these slippers highly enough for anyone, even if you don’t have any foot issues or problems - they are just great in every way! *** I bought this in the bright, lime green color and just got them a week ago, but from the description of THIS PAIR, it’s said they are MACHINE WASHABLE! That’s a definite plus for me, since I constantly wash the soles of my other ones by hand, being careful not to get the suede wet. (I also have a very bad case of OCD!)

The 6 was very snug and i felt like my toes were going to bust through the front, the 7’s were way to big. I ended up keeping the 6’s and decided to try break them in, I’m narrow footed. But now that it’s been a week I’m obsessed! I just got a chestnut pair in 6 as well.So if you’re narrow footed I’d suggest to size down, if you have a wide foot size up. Going down a size sucked for 2 days but I pushed through and now they fit perfect and are comfy, I have very very light heel lift but it’s not even noticeable. Like my heel stops it as soon as I start to go up walking. The 7’s were so big I was flopping around like a penguin. I uploaded a video of how much they’ll move with me pulling on them like I’d want to plop them off. They prob move less when I walk lolSo my personal size suggestions:*if you want tight fit and are half size, size down.*if you want loose fit and half size, size up.*if whole size and want tight fit, stick to normal size*if whole size and want loose fit, size up one size*if narrow footed and half size, size down*if normal footed and normal size, stick to size*if half size and wide footed, size up*if solid sized and wide footed, personally I’d size up cause they are narrow but will stretch some.

Love this color and by chance stumbled upon these a while ago when they were in stock and glad I impulsively bought them. They match everything and are truly the comfort you expect from Ugg. Also, I recently had knee surgery and my ankle and foot are swollen from it. These are all I wear and are still comfortable and easy to get on and off. I typically wear an 8 in Ugg boots but go up to a size 9 in these and the Tazz’s!

I was hesitant about the size, worried that “Small” would be too small to hold my necessary items and yet still be comfortable. To my surprise, this little bag is perfect. It holds my minimalist wallet, a coin purse, cell phone, medical information wallet, sunglasses,  lipstick, and inhaler. There’s even room left over for my small planner and pen. It is lightweight and a comfortable fit for my 5’1” frame. It also fits inside my larger tote bag for travel. The price is reasonable and  I plan to pick up a couple more in different colors. The bag is well made with a soft nylon fabric and the sturdy adjustable strap fits perfectly across the body or on shoulder. I am extremely happy with this little bag!

This bag is cute and fits a surprising amount of stuff, great size for an everyday errands bag. However, after about a month, the zipper pull ripped out of the slider tab. I can still open and close the bag but I need to pinch the slider and pull it across. The seam where the zipper attaches has also begun to fray (this started about two months into having the bag) and the threads are getting caught in the zipper. This week (after three months), some of the zipper teeth are coming out of alignment. The bag still works but I'm already looking for a replacement.

It's a performance bike instead of a cruiser
Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2014Style: Professional Gas Grill, Two-Burner, Stainless SteelPattern Name: Gas GrillVerified Purchase
Me: A foodie dad in the USA who loves to grill and has a couple decades of experience with serious grilling, smoking and outdoor roasting, up to and including whole hogs.  Also, I'm an engineering geek that notices things that many less technical people overlook.You: Somebody who wonders if a portable grill is worth owning.My review:  (This first review is being written after owning the grill for a week and using it several times.  I promise to post updates as regards durability or other emerging issues)I like this grill, and here's why.It's well built.  All stainless, quality fittings, includes a heavy gauge propane fitting (note: uses a standard 20lb propane tank, not a camp bottle).It zooms up to 600 degrees (F) in less than ten minutes, and cools to the point I can remove the grate with my bare hand within twenty minutes after I turn it off.  The built-in thermometer is accurate and agile (it reflected with perfect accuracy that it was 100F in the Carolinas the first day I set it up).  Initial setup required no tools and was no more difficult than unboxing, unfolding, and placing the burner covers and cooking grill in the right place.My first cook were some gigantic boneless chicken breasts I bought at Sams.  I thought they were big in the store, but when I removed them from the package for marinating, I double-checked to make sure they weren't turkey breasts... more than an inch thick at the wing-turn even after I broke them out for grilling.  I was able to cook them perfectly with the right amount of char by paying attention... even with vegetables on the grill beside them.Steaks were next, and I got a perfect medium rare NY strip in 8 min after preheat.Every working surface is stainless steel, even the burner shields and the bottom of the oven, which makes cleanup easy.  The legs fold up and the lid latches to the side, so that you can carry the grill like a suitcase and store it either horizontally or vertically (like you'd store a suitcase).When they say tabletop, they aren't kidding.  I stuck a thermometer on the table under the grill after it was preheated to see how much heat transferred.  The air temperature rated only 5 degrees above ambient, and I couldn't detect the difference with my fingers.  There is a sealed bottom design with a large capacity, removable (slides out to the side) drip tray (also stainless steel) which collects an estimated 2 quarts of drippings, so there's no reasonable way you could overflow onto your tabletop unless you're cooking 50+ cheap burgers at a go.  I'm confident that you could cook 4 steaks and 8 pieces of chicken inside on your dining room table without messing up anything if you disable the smoke detectors.What you need to know:1. The dome is very shallow.  You won't be able to cook a whole ham in here, although a pork shoulder just fits.2. The stainless steel is well engineered, but light gauge.  This is to enhance portability and (undoubtedly) reduce cost of manufacture.  This means that it heats up and cools down quickly, which is convenient if you're moving the grill around and cleaning it, but inconvenient if you want to heat up a grill and have it hold its temperature, which leads us to my next point...3.  The light gauge steel plus the shallow dome means that opening the grill top to turn or braise will cost you at least 50F, and often 100F.  It only takes 1 minute to regain heat again, but purists should take note.  This is why I call it a performance bike.4.  Because it cools quickly and all the surfaces are stainless steel, I was able to serve dinner, eat, and then remove the cooktop, burner covers, and drip tray and put them in the dishwasher along with the rest of the dishes.  This was my favorite feature of the grill... I've never had one that I could clean with a dishwasher, and using the same schedule I'd use to clean up the kitchen after dinner.  This one feature was worth almost as much as I paid for the grill.5. Indirect cooking was super easy due to the 2-burner configuration and the shallow dome.  You can turn on one side, sear your meat, and then move it to the other side of the grill to finish cooking.  When you close the lid with the shallow dome, this works better than it works on a Coleman kettle grill.Will post updates.

Great grill, but something you need to know when lighting it...
Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2024Style: Professional Gas Grill, Two-Burner, Stainless SteelPattern Name: Gas GrillVerified Purchase
First, the ""something you need to know"":  The ignition mechanism works very well, always on one click (in my experience).  However, when I first fired up the grill, I didn't understand the mechanism.  There's a little blow-torch that is electrically ignited, which lights the burner.  Pressing in on the knob is what sends gas to the little torch, which makes a ""whooshing"" noise.  Then when you let the knob back out, the ""whooshing"" stops, and you can't see any flame.  So you think, ""Oh no!  This fancy grill doesn't work!""  HOWEVER, the flame is there.  It's simply quiet and colorless.  You might see it at night, but not by day.  You will know your burner is lit, because heat will rise up.With that out of the way...Yeah, every piece of this grill is stainless steel!  That's why I bought it as the replacement to my  rusted-out, ubiquitous stainless-top patio grill.  I had taken the previous grill as far as it could go, even replacing the burners, flame tamers, and bottom pan with stainless parts.  However, the body of the grill was rusting to pieces.  Enough of rusty grills!I like that the grate is substantial and will hold some heat. I've only used it for grilling burgers so far, but it seems to work fine.The grill puts out substantial heat, and the heat distribution is surprisingly uniform.  I was able to fill the grill with hamburger patties and cook them in a fairly strong, cold breeze.  I don't know that my old grill would have gotten hot enough.  The thermometer at the top of the Cuisinart grill registered 400 degF, despite the cold wind and the grill being completely loaded.  The patties cooked quickly and evenly.Cleanup is easy.  You can literally set this grill in the yard and hose it out.We are keeping this grill on the top of a patio serving cart, so that we can roll it around on our deck.  The propane bottle fits in the shelf on the bottom. The only con is a minor one:  There's not a great way to secure the propane hose, without stuffing it among burner hardware and ignition wires.If I ever have problems with this grill, I'll come back and write about it.  This review was written March 24, 2024.

High quality construction with built-in thermostat and flame ignition
Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2023Style: Professional Gas Grill, Two-Burner, Stainless SteelPattern Name: Gas GrillVerified Purchase
I recently purchased this grill and have to say that it has exceeded all my expectations. Here are some of the reasons why I'm so pleased with my purchase:Portability: One of the standout features of this grill is its portability. It's compact, lightweight, locks closed and has foldable legs, making it incredibly easy to transport.Quick and Convenient: Firing up this grill straight out of the box is a breeze. With its piezo igniters built into the gas knobs, I can start cooking within minutes.Even Heat Distribution: The grill's burners provide an even heat distribution across the cooking surface, which means my food cooks consistently. Whether I'm grilling steaks, burgers, chicken, or vegetables, I can count on perfectly cooked meals every time.Adjustable Heat Control: The grill's adjustable heat control knobs give me the flexibility to cook a wide variety of dishes. From searing at high heat to slow-roasting at low temperatures, this grill can handle it all, and the easy-to-read thermometer built into the hood, makes setting the ideal heat easy peasyEasy to Clean: The grates are easy to remove and clean, and the drip tray catches any grease or food drippings, making cleanup a quick and painless process.Durable Construction: The build quality of this grill is impressive. It feels solid and well-made, ensuring that it will withstand regular use and last for years to come. Even the foldable legs feel solid as a rock.In conclusion, this grill is a top choice for anyone who loves grilling on the go. I highly recommend it to fellow outdoor cooking enthusiasts and believe it's a fantastic addition to any outdoor activity, from picnics to camping trips.

There are some purchases that last a lifetime and are well worth the higher investment.  This is certainly the top of the investment food chain when it comes to coolers.  I have a couple of others and they are almost too well made.  They are heavy and hard to move around, clunkie and made with a lot of material.  I suppose this is why they hold temperature so well.  The older coolers that I have are excellent and hold up well, but if when i look at those same brands, they are made vry different these days.  This is why I switched to this brand, and am happy to have done so.  Definately not the only option and certainly a premium investment but only you can decide if its the best choice for your uses.  All the best, enjoy the great outdoors.

I purchased the Yeti Thin Ice Refreezable Cooler Ice Pack when I purchased a Hopper Flip 8.  I work as a firefighter and thought this would be a great addition to my work vehicle.  The Hopper Flip 8 is the perfect size for a guy to pack his lunch, drinks, and snacks for the day.  I have other Yeti products and believe in the name being synonymous with quality and I don't mind paying for quality - when it's warranted.  The first day I used the Hopper Flip 8 and the Thin Ice Pack, my lunch was 'cool' and the ice pack was no longer ice.  The next day I used my new cooler, I used a much cheaper ice pack that we've had for years.  I'm not sure what brand because honestly, we just picked it up on a weekly supermarket trip.  Result?  It was still frozen inside my cooler when I got home at the end of my 12 hour shift.Overall, I give the Hopper 5 stars and the Thin Ice Pack 3.  For the value, the Thin Ice Pack simply isn't worth the money.

The Zojirushi Rice Cooker - My Kitchen's New MVP!
Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023Size: 5.5 cupsStyle: Rice CookerVerified Purchase
I can't believe I'm writing a review for a rice cooker, but the Zojirushi has truly earned its place as an essential kitchen appliance in my home.Let me start by saying that I'm not a professional chef; I'm just a regular person who enjoys good food. And this rice cooker has made my life so much easier.First off, it's incredibly easy to use. You simply measure your rice and water, press a button, and voila – perfectly cooked rice every single time. No more guesswork, no more burnt rice on the bottom of the pot, and no more hovering over the stove.But it's not just for rice! This magical machine has settings for different types of rice (white, brown, sushi, etc.), porridge, and even a cake setting! Yep, you read that right – you can bake a cake in this thing, and it turns out moist and delicious.The ""keep warm"" feature is a game-changer too. It keeps your rice at the perfect temperature for hours, so you can prepare the rest of your meal without worrying about your rice getting cold and clumpy.Cleaning is a breeze, too, thanks to the nonstick inner pot and detachable parts that are dishwasher-safe.Now, let's talk about the quality.

The last rice cooker you'll ever buy, probably
Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2023Size: 5.5 cupsStyle: Rice CookerVerified Purchase
Purchased in June 2016, used at least weekly since then (often 3-5 times a week)Before I say anything else, a note about cooking rice - RINSE YOUR RICE, PEOPLE. IT'S IN THE DIRECTIONS AND IT'S CRUCIAL FOR GOOD RICE.Fit & Finish:- Despite the shell being mostly plastic, this rice cooker feels a bit luxe and everything is nice and tight. The super shiny plastic is extremely easy to wipe down whenever it gets dirty.- The retractable power cord is an amazing feature, such a creature comfort. It works just like it did when we got it, albeit slightly slower now. I've never had a problem with getting it to go in the direction I needed.- The lid and hinge mech is solid and easy to use, just one big button to release. An interesting thing to note is the hinge only opens just beyond far enough for the rice pan to be insertable into the machine, so if it didn't pop up all the way and your hands are full, you'll need to use an elbow to nudge it the rest of the way open. My solution is to just pop it open and make sure it's fully open before I start doing anything else.- The handle is light and plastic but has not cracked at any point, not even the joints. This was something I was worried about since the unit feels like it could be an issue, but I kinda swing this thing around when moving it in/out of my pantry, and it's still totally solid.Product in use:- The user interface (buttons and screen) is intuitive, easy to use, and there are no seams between the buttons for any water ingress. The buttons on my unit haven't even started to wear down after 7 years.- As far as functions go, I only really ever use the White or Quick rice features - I don't eat brown rice at home, and haven't felt the need to use any of the other ones. I've also never used the timer feature as I am not the best planner. But this thing sure does make the most perfectly cooked rice every single time. It's honestly kind of rough having such high quality, easy to cook, white rice at home, and then go out to eat and the rice you're eating is just mushy and overcooked or gummy. This thing spoils you.--- A note about Quick Rice - I have found that the quicker cook time /can/ lead to slightly tackier/gummier rice if you open the lid as soon as the cycle ends. I would give it a few extra minutes to steam out before opening and the rice will be almost as perfect as the regular cycle.- Volume of rice cooked - I don't think I have ever maxed this thing out, but I have gotten close. What is MORE impressive, is that I can cook 1 single 'cup'** (**OF THE CUP THEY GIVE YOU TO MEASURE THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE LINES IN THE RICE PAN, WHICH IS ACTUALLY 3/4 CUP) of rice and it comes out just as perfect as if I cooked rice for 6 people. This amount of rice has never been short of enough for one meal for two adults. On quick rice, this amount cooks in like...15 minutes? And on White it'll start at 50, but will actually skip a few and be done in 25min or so.Summary:I thought for sure that $130 (at my time of purchase) was a bit overkill for a rice cooker, but I will 1000% buy another one of these whenever my current unit dies, if that ever happens. I thought 7 years was a good run (< $20/year for perfect rice at home?!) so any more time after this is just a big bonus.10/10, and 10/10 with rice.
