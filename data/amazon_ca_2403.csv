A New Favorite in Game Night: Hasbro's Wordle The Party Game
Reviewed in Canada on February 20, 2024Verified Purchase
As a lover of word games and a connoisseur of party entertainment, my anticipation was high when I heard about Hasbro's adaptation of the wildly popular New York Times Wordle game into a board game format. ""Wordle The Party Game"" promised to bring the addictive challenge of the online sensation right to our tabletops, and it has delivered magnificently. This game has quickly ascended to the top of my list for group activities, merging the joy of word puzzles with the dynamic fun of playing with friends and family.From the first game night we introduced it, ""Wordle The Party Game"" became an instant hit among my circle. Designed for 2-4 players and suitable for ages 14 and up, it has proven to be a versatile game that appeals to a wide range of players, from casual word enthusiasts to more competitive puzzle solvers. The game beautifully captures the essence of the digital version's daily challenge, encouraging players to deduce the secret word with as few guesses as possible, but adds a communal twist that elevates the experience.The gameplay is intuitive yet stimulating, requiring each player to guess a five-letter word within six tries, using deduction to narrow down the possibilities. What makes the board game version stand out is the way it transforms a solitary guessing game into an interactive competition. Players take turns being the ""Wordle Host,"" setting the word for others to guess, which adds a delightful element of strategy and anticipation to the mix.The quality and design of the game components are top-notch, as expected from Hasbro. The board, tiles, and playing pieces are durable and well-crafted, ensuring that the game can withstand the excitement of countless game nights. Additionally, the game setup and rules are straightforward, making it easy for new players to jump right in and for veterans of the digital Wordle to feel right at home.One of the aspects I appreciate most about ""Wordle The Party Game"" is its educational value, subtly woven into the fun. It's a brilliant way to expand vocabulary, sharpen spelling skills, and enhance critical thinking, all within the context of a highly engaging game. Moreover, the social interaction it fosters, from the shared triumphs of guessing a word correctly to the collective groans of a miss, brings a heartwarming sense of connection and camaraderie to our gatherings.In conclusion, ""Wordle The Party Game"" by Hasbro has been a fantastic addition to my collection of party games. It strikes a perfect balance between challenging and entertaining, making it a suitable choice for a wide array of occasions, from casual family nights to more spirited gatherings with friends. If you're a fan of word games or looking for a fresh way to spice up your game nights, I highly recommend giving this game a try. It's not just a game; it's a celebration of words, wit, and the joy of discovery shared with those you enjoy spending time with.

Guessing the word and having the host check everyone's words with the little privacy wall so no one can see your guesses was very fun.The privacy walls were adorable and the markers were decent quality.  Make sure to wipe with a damp cloth when you're done.Could have included more boards for more players.  Overall, great 20-30 minute game.To make more boards, you can photocopy 2 at a time, cut them in half, and then put them in a paper protector (also cut in half).

Great game if you are a fan of the online version. The markers that come with the game are almost impossible to erase. Save yourself the headache and start with brand new dry erase markers. Would be 5 stars but have to incur an extra cost to have erasable markers.

 I am an admittedly terrible cook when it comes to traditional means of using a stove and I imagine that my cooking is a slight step up from eating canned dog food, but the Instant Pot has entirely changed this.This thing is friendly for cooking dummies like myself.  There are tons of delicious recipes online that are easy to follow and once everything is in the pot, you simply start a timer and that's it. Once the timer is done, open the valve to release the steam and once the steam has released, dinner is served. There is literally nothing to screw up during the cooking process; it's simple and ingenious.The Instant Pot works by using pressure from steam to significantly shorten cooking times meaning more time for you to do other fun things like hanging out with your significant other, or watching TV, or both!  We've made 'fall off the bone' ribs in about 45 mins (including creating the sauté and taking into account warming up and steam release) that were comparable in taste to ribs that had been slow cooked for 4 hrs. We've also used it to make homemade soups as it takes much less time for the flavour in the ingredients in the soup to trickle into the soup vs traditional boiling over a stove. Chicken in ten minutes? You bet. Perfectly cooked hard boiled eggs in under 5 minutes and delicious cheesecake in under an hour (including steam release) were all no problem for even a simpleton like myself to make, and best of all, everything actually tastes great too!!  I've included pictures of a few of the things we've made using the Instant Pot.  Yes, all of the food pictures in this review were made using the Instant Pot!When it comes to cooking, there aren't too many things out there that are game changers, but an air fryer, a sous vide and an Instant Pot are, and if you happen to have all three, congratulations for having the trifecta of cooking greatness in your kitchen!PROS* So easy to use that even guys that literally can't cook (me) can look like a rock star. Once everything is in the pot, you set the timer and go. Once it's done, open the valve to release the steam and dinner is served. There literally is nothing to screw up and best of all, the food is delicious!* The Instant Pot significantly shortens cooking time of most things, freeing up your valuable time to do other fun things! :P* There are literally tons and tons of delicious recipes online. Guaranteed you will discover there are things that you can make in the Instant Pot that you never knew could be made in an Instant Pot.* Goodbye slow cooker. That was so the 70's.* Easy to clean. The pot is stainless steel and the lid can be removed and fully submerged. The seal on the lid comes off and replacement seals for the lid can be purchased when it eventually wears out.CONS* Too many models just make for mass confusion.  Have a look at my TIPS section for some help.* Expensive, so wait for a sale if you can as they do on sale, especially for big events like Boxing Day, Black Friday, etc.TIPS* Don't get too caught up with the ""x-in-1"" features. They just add a preset cooking time for a type of food to the Instant Pot and up the ""in-1"" number. You can just manually input the cooking time yourself.* The most important thing is determining the size of the Instant Pot that you need. For our family of 4, we went for the 8 quart esp. since the wife likes to make home made soups.* The Lux model does not have low pressure cooking while Duo models have both high and low pressure. Low pressure cooking is typically used to make delicate foods like yogurt, eggs and veggies. If you don't think you'll make yogurt, eggs or veggies in the Instant Pot, just get the Lux model which skips the low pressure. Pro tip: Cooking rice uses high pressure.* Take the Instant Pot outdoors to release the steam when doing a quick release or it will quickly smell up the house of whatever you're making. Use a glove or mitt to be safe.* When making a lot of food, esp. soups, mind the max line. If you want less chance to have a mess on the bottom of the lid, go an inch under the max line.* Be careful when releasing the steam.  I've included a video of what a fast release of the steam looks like.  You don't want your bare hand anywhere close to that hot steam.  Read the instruction manual!!!  Seriously, read it.

As an occasional and budding home cook, the 6-quart Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker has been a complete game-changer in my kitchen! This versatile kitchen appliance has become my go-to for whipping up delicious meals with minimal effort and maximum flavor.First and foremost, the 7-in-1 functionality is mind-blowing. It's like having a team of kitchen gadgets in one sleek and compact device. From pressure cooking to slow cooking, rice cooking, steaming, sautéing, yogurt making, and warming, this Instant Pot does it all!The pressure cooking feature is the real star of the show. It significantly reduces cooking times, making it a lifesaver on busy weeknights. Whether I'm preparing tender stews, fall-off-the-bone ribs, or flavor-packed soups, the Instant Pot never fails to deliver perfectly cooked meals in a fraction of the time.The slow cooker function is equally impressive. It lets me set it and forget it, making it incredibly convenient for days when I'm occupied with other tasks. The result? Melt-in-your-mouth pulled pork, rich and hearty chili, or tender pot roasts that are sure to impress.Rice cooking has never been easier. The Instant Pot consistently produces fluffy and perfectly cooked rice, taking away the guesswork and hassle from traditional stovetop methods.I was initially skeptical about the yogurt-making feature, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Homemade yogurt is not only healthier but also more cost-effective, and the Instant Pot handles the process like a pro.The sauté function is perfect for browning meats and sautéing onions and garlic before pressure cooking. It's a fantastic all-in-one tool that reduces the number of pots and pans I need to wash.The 6-quart capacity is ideal for feeding a family or having leftovers for the next day. The stainless steel inner pot is easy to clean, and the exterior stays cool to the touch during cooking, ensuring safety and convenience.The user-friendly control panel with pre-set cooking options and a delay start feature makes meal planning a breeze. Additionally, the included accessories like the steam rack, serving spoon, and measuring cup are thoughtful additions that add to the overall value.In summary, the 6-quart Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker is an absolute must-have for any kitchen.

Disappointing Experience
Reviewed in Canada on January 14, 2024Verified Purchase
I had high hopes for the Hismile v34 Colour Corrector, especially with the buzz around its teeth whitening capabilities. However, my experience fell short of expectations.Despite following the application instructions carefully, I noticed no significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. The product claims to correct yellow tones and enhance brightness, but I did not observe these results even after consistent use.Given the lack of effectiveness, I decided to return the product. The return process was straightforward, which I appreciate. Nonetheless, it was disheartening to invest time and expectations into a product that did not deliver the promised results.While the concept of the Hismile v34 Colour Corrector is innovative, and the product may work for others, it unfortunately did not work for me. This experience highlights the variability in results with cosmetic products and the importance of managing expectations.

Reviewed in Canada on January 17, 2024Verified Purchase
This product works well. It does brighten and remove yellowing however you need to use it everyday to keep up the results.  I was using my regular toothpaste  and then brushing again with the Hismile. It got to be a bit of a pain in the ass. Then I combined the two but it got messy and the results weren't  as good. If only they made it with flouride that would be great. I will use when I know of an upcoming event I need to attend or special occasion etc. Since it is so expensive.

Reviewed in Canada on January 10, 2024Verified Purchase
Long story short, this product made it difficult for me to breathe after using it. My whole mouth and throat got dry and swallowing became a laboured process. I used it in the evening so sleeping was not easy. Took a while to realize what caused it.When first used, I immediately noticed that the flavour is not there, tasted like a bad chemical was in my mouth. Tried for a week before realizing it wasn’t doing much to whiten my teeth either; not noticeably.Definitely consider other products before this one. Despite all the great reviews and claims, there could be awful side effects.

Reviewed in Canada on January 24, 2024Size: 64GBColour: BlueVerified Purchase
I ordered it and it came the next day. Good deal. However, the charging block came completely fried. The charger that came is a 20-watt Otter Box one, but no matter what I do, it doesn't work. I ran the old sniff test, and I can 100% conclude it arrived fried, as it gave off that distinctive smell. Too bad... I wanted to get a replacement for the charger, but that would mean I have to send it all back..??? I expect a representative sees this and understand my sadness. Please send me a new one; if so, I will definitely increase my rating.  Everything else is great, though: brand-new cable and a great phone.

Bought this expecting a new screen and battery like apple would give you. To be fair it would be ok for your kids.  The screen placed beside my oem iphone 12 shows quite a difference. Lack of brilliance. Next the battery was in worse shape than my current phone.  Glue had also extruded from the silent button.  A few minor scratches on the camera bezel.  I dealt with these resellers before with my daughter’s iphone, the quality just isn’t there. Unfortunately I just have to pay for new one to get it the way I want it. Hope this helps.

I recently started using this face cleansing oil and I must say, it has completely transformed my skincare routine. This product provides a deep and thorough cleanse, leaving my skin feeling refreshed, nourished, and incredibly clean.First and foremost, the texture of this face cleansing oil is luxurious. It has a lightweight and silky-smooth consistency that glides effortlessly across the skin. The oil effectively removes makeup, dirt, and impurities without stripping away the skin's natural moisture.One of the standout features of this cleansing oil is its ability to dissolve even the most stubborn makeup. It effortlessly melts away waterproof mascara, long-lasting foundation, and heavy eye makeup, making the cleansing process quick and easy. I no longer have to struggle with multiple products or harsh rubbing to remove my makeup.Furthermore, this face cleansing oil is incredibly gentle on the skin. It does not cause any irritation or dryness, making it suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. The formula is free from harsh chemicals and fragrances, ensuring a soothing and comfortable cleansing experience.Additionally, this cleansing oil leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and hydrated. It effectively removes impurities and unclogs pores, resulting in a clearer complexion. Even after rinsing off the oil, my skin feels moisturized and supple, without any greasy residue.Moreover, the fragrance of this cleansing oil is subtle and pleasant. It adds a touch of relaxation to my skincare routine without being overpowering or irritating. The scent is light and refreshing, enhancing the overall experience of using this product.Another great feature of this face cleansing oil is its versatility. It can be used as a standalone cleanser or as part of a double cleansing routine. The oil effortlessly emulsifies upon contact with water, turning into a milky consistency that rinses away easily, leaving no residue behind.Overall, I highly recommend this face cleansing oil. It provides a luxurious and effective cleansing experience, removing makeup and impurities while leaving the skin feeling nourished and refreshed.

Great oil cleanser if used correctly
Reviewed in Canada on April 10, 2024Verified Purchase
I love this oil cleanser for double cleansing. Wouldn’t use alone as it would clog my pores, but it’s perfect to use before a water based cleanser. I used it wrong at first and didn’t see much improvement with my skin, but as soon as I started using it correctly, I started seeing an improvement with my blackheads, sebaceous filaments and pores. My tip, use on dry skin, using smaller round motions all over and focusing on problem areas for 1-2 minutes, then emulsify with a bit of water. Rinse and then cleanse using a water based cleaner for a minute making sure your completely clean your face to get rid of any left over oil cleanser and rince thoroughly. You’ll see results so quickly!

Went from perfect skin to horrible acne rashes
Reviewed in Canada on February 27, 2024Verified Purchase
I was really looking forward to trying this after seeing so many TikTok’s preaching about its pore cleaning abilities and having that glass skin look. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and my skin has broken out in countless blackheads and pimple rashes all over my face. I’m actually in shock of how poorly my skin is reacting to this product. Could be the perfume in it or just that it’s an oil cleanser but wow is it a disappointment. I always double cleanse and second cleanse with a gel to cut the oil but it doesn’t seem to matter with this one. I really don’t recommend it if you have oily or acne prone skin. I’ll be switching back to medical grade skincare to try and correct the damage.

Sizing off - uncomfortable
Reviewed in Canada on September 1, 2022Size: Small (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
Sizing is off on this product. I bought this brace hoping to assist with my ankle fracture recovery. Unfortunately it’s too tight - specifically the bottom tongue portion, which wraps around your foot. There’s no stretch in that area, therefore when walking it jams into the top of my foot, making it really uncomfortable. If I go up one size, it’ll be loose elsewhere. Emailed the company directly about a possible return but I still have not heard a response back from them. Wasted money on something that is not useable. Learned my lesson that I need to physically go in-store to try on, to ensure comfort before buying another one.

For people who are sensitive to dyes and artificial colouring additives, be aware that these gel caps contain them. I had to dump the iron content of each pill into a clear vegetable capsule in order to take them as I react to the artificial colouring used in these blue and green capsules. Once I did that, the product was very effective almost immediately and I had more energy within days of starting to take them. Unfortunately, it’s time consuming to have to switch out the capsules, so I have gone back to Ferapro, which Amazon now has back in stock, thankfully.

So, I had to get a 6qt as it was around $95 but its too big for one person, be great for a family though. I rate this 5 star for the actual product, but 1 star for inflating prices.

This is my second IP. I had a 5 quart but wanted one smaller as well.I use it regularly and love its easy and quick cooking. I no longer slow cook after discovering pressure cooking. ( quicker, more flavourful, higher level of nutrients retained and easier for time management.Proteins are fall off the bones tender even the cheapest cuts which have more flavour and cost lessCooking dried beans is fast, waaay cheaper than canned and tastier.The build quality is very high. I also have a cosori 2 quart which I love for its hinged lid but it’s build quality is inferior to the IP and at time of writing this review is considerably more expensiveOverall I LOVE my IPI took one star off because I get frustrated with one design issue. The lid isn’t hinged and it also doesn’t line up when open with the slots to hold it open. As the lids are heavy ( reflects build quality ) and everything is hot after cooking an easy pivot of the lid into holding slots rather than rotating to try and line them up would be an very much liked improvement

I loved the Instant Pot I purchased for myself so much that I purchased a second one as a Christmas gift for my best friend.Easy to use. Makes the most fantastic soups - with melt in your mouth meat and flavourful sauce/gravy.The saute function works remarkably well (browning the meat before starting the soup function makes it so much more flavourful, and you don't have to use a second pan to do so) - works as well as a frying pan would.Also very easy to use the pressure cooker or slow cooker function on their own without using one of the pre-set functions.

""This thing was hyped up online, but after using it for almost a month, I haven't seen any results. However, I've experienced quite a few side effects. It causes dilation of blood vessels in your head, leading to a throbbing headache, and this throbbing sensation lasts for a long time, after taking the medication every day, after exercising, and after sweating on the head. If I were to rate the pain on a scale of 1-10, I'd say this throbbing pain could reach level 2-3 not negligible, not unbearable, but its prolonged presence still significantly affects one's mood and emotions. I've also heard that this thing can indeed cause low blood pressure, so friends with low blood pressure, please use it with caution. I'll continue using it for six months, and if there are no results, I'll reconsider my rating.""

I bought these to replace the original joycons on my OLED Switch. My L button wasn't working and I didn't realize it until I was trying to 'go online' to trade Pokemon with my brother and the button required was not working.I was a little annoyed I couldn't find the same pair of white Joycons to replace the original set I had, and of the colour options available, the Neon Pink/Neon Green seemed like the most fun. I have to say, I really love the colours. The OCD in me does sometimes wish I had two of the same colour, but honestly the pink and green really pop with the darkness of the black screen area. They're so vibrant.Oh and they work well too, I suppose that's somewhat important too.

Needed to replace the controllers on my daughter's Switch.  I'd previously tried the no-name brand, and while much lighter in weight, they worked - for a time.  Unfortunately, the knockoffs are cheaply made and not repairable with a kit - the little screws strip are cheap, softer metal and strip far too easily.  So, went back to the brand-name ones and they work great.  Expensive (overpriced), in my opinion.

Then, we reported to Amazon and dressed this issue and hope this company can fine out what was the issue, and we were told that they will investigate and we could order it next week. Moreover, we just re ordered it again two days ago, and received an item was still a defective product!  As a result, this company didn’t bother to fix the issues and still post them Amazon!

Reviewed in Canada on March 29, 2024Style: USB-C ConnectorVerified Purchase
I recently purchased the Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Generation with MagSafe Case, and they have truly been a game-changer for me. Not only do they provide exceptional sound quality and seamless connectivity, but they also come with a feature that saved me from a major headache.Unfortunately, I lost my AirPods Pro at my workplace, and someone took them. However, thanks to the Find My feature from Apple, I was able to locate them with ease. The ability to lock the AirPods remotely gave me peace of mind knowing that they couldn't be used by anyone else, and the pinpoint accuracy of the Find My app helped me track them down quickly.Aside from this incredible feature, the AirPods Pro themselves are outstanding. The sound quality is crisp and immersive, making every listening experience enjoyable. The active noise cancellation works like a charm, blocking out external noise and allowing me to focus on my music or podcasts without distractions.The MagSafe Case is another highlight of this product. Not only does it provide convenient wireless charging, but it also ensures that my AirPods Pro stay secure and protected when not in use. The sleek design of both the AirPods and the case adds a touch of elegance to my daily routine.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Generation with MagSafe Case. Not only do they deliver exceptional audio quality and convenience, but they also come with a lifesaving feature in the form of Find My. Five stars without a doubt!

New iPhone used and seriously impressed
Reviewed in Canada on November 25, 2023Style: USB-C ConnectorVerified Purchase
I was a Samsung android user for about 15 years and finally decided to make the switch to iPhone with the new 15 Pro lineup, as I love my  M1 MBP and I have been following Apple  products from afar since. Now that the 15 lineup is USB C, I decided to go all in on the Apple ecosystem.I am blown away by these airpods. Thankfully the second gens come with XS ear tips, because that's the only size that doesn't slowly push themselves out of my ear.But let me get to what I really love about these things:- the seamless transfer of connection between my M1 macbook pro and iPhone. It happens in about 1.5 seconds flat as soon as I begin playing audio/video on another device. And somehow it also knows when I don't need it to transfer?! I don't even know.-the charging speed of the pods themseld. I think I just popped them into the case for 10 mins, less than 15 for sure, and they jumped from 18% charge to 80% just like that.-transparency and noise cancellation. Remarkable and I use both depending on my environment. Haven't really found a use for Adaptive mode after a while, but that's ok. When you're walking on a busy street, noise cancellation is so soothing. Drowns out like 90-95% of the traffic sounds.-conversational awareness is great too, but I generally leave it off unless I'm in a grocery store or somewhere that I might need to interrupt the audio by speaking to someone for a few seconds. Only time I use it.- Con: they're super slippery! I have dropped the pods a couple of times because of this, especially when you get any skin oils on them, but no damage so far. I also just got a silicone cover for the charging case, in hopes that the pods don't just eject themselves when you drop the whole case on the floor. I think that fixed my concern in some quick tests from a 2 foot drop on carpet, because I've seen them eject from that height before.BONUS: These airpod pro 2s with USB C have a special feature that lightning cable pro 2s do not! Lossless audio, but this only applies to using them with the Vision Pro. I probably won't but the Vision Pro any time soon, but it's good to know that I will have that feature should I ever get them in the future.Buy these at full price or especially buy them when you see them 10-17% off. You will NOT be disappointed.

The best earbuds I’ve ever owned
Reviewed in Canada on March 16, 2024Style: USB-C ConnectorVerified Purchase
I was using Google Pixel Buds Pro with my iPhone 11 for less than a year, and I was satisfied, until they stopped holding a charge last week. I was pretty upset when they stopped working because I use earbuds most of the day while I’m working, and even at home. This week I was reading reviews on several top quality earbuds and I was almost sold on Bose because I have always enjoyed the sound quality of Bose products, in my opinion they are one of the highest quality speakers in the industry. Bose and Apple AirPod Pro 2nd generation are nearly identical in quality and performance from the dozens of reviews that I read. The only reason I chose Apple is because I am an iPhone user, and the functions and features of these earbuds work seamlessly with iPhones. Where as, the Bose earbuds require an additional app to control the features on an iPhone, such as spacial audio, noise cancellation, transparency mode, etc. I also really like that the earbuds themselves, as well as the charging case are able to be tracked or located with Apple’s native FindMy app, this is huge, no more loosing my earbuds when I fall asleep while they are in use. Overall, I am very happy with this product, and I look forward to seeing how well the noise canceling system works on the shooting range, my shooting partner swears by his Airpod Pro 1st generation, so I can’t wait to see how 2nd generation compares.

Reviewed in Canada on November 15, 2016Edition: NESVerified Purchase
Great little console to relive your childhood memories.  Like everyone else before me stated the controller cord is annoyingly short but I will get an extension when they are back in stock. As for the games, there are many classics on board that helped to define the gaming industry as a whole and it is definately a solid lineup. I own an original NES with many of the games that come in this but the convenience factor of not having to switch cartridges, blow in them, or replace 72-pin connectors is a huge help.  So not pay these scalper prices and patiently wait for more stock.On a side note even the best interface is highly polished. If you leave the system on the main menu and walk away for a minute it starts to demo clips from all of the installed titles in a cool way. The 4 save states for the games is a huge help as well and has a lock feature so it's harder to overwrite a save.  Definately worth the price and I wish everyone luck in the restocks.

A great product that should be purchased at $79.99, rather than the reseller prices. Wait for them to come back into stock.
Reviewed in Canada on November 26, 2016Edition: NESVerified PurchaseNintendo Entertainment System NES Classic Edition
Quick Look: Excellent system that comes with 30 games. Great value at $79.99 CDN. Worth a look for anyone who likes retro gaming, or wants to experience these old games for the first time.When the NES Classic was announced, I was very excited. I actually still have my original NES with many games, but there were quite a few on here that I do not own outside of the Mario games, and thus I was very pleased with the selection. Plus it is nice to have backups just in case the originals stop working at some point.The system itself is small and can be held in the palm of your hand. This is a great advantage for storage or transport, but unfortunately the cable length for the controller is rather short.As far as how the system works, the dashboard that displays the games is fantastic and very easy to use. Each game has several suspend points (otherwise known as save slots), so you can have multiple saves. This is especially useful if you have more than one player in the household, and it allows everyone to maintain their saved game.As mentioned before, the selection of games is wonderful. It has several that are hard to get original cartridges of these days, and so it fills a nice gap in that regard. I was overjoyed to own Mega Man 2 again (a game I lost as a child and never found again), and have spent extensive time playing through Final Fantasy. The emulation of the games themselves is essentially flawless.Overall, if you are a gaming fan, this is a must buy. However, don't buy it at the inflated prices of the resellers. Wait for it to come back into stock.Pros:Great game selectionDashboard is very easy to useSave points/save states/suspend pointsHDMI hook up makes it easy to game with newer televisionsPerfect emulationDifferent display modes for more retro looksCons:The HDMI cable is shortThe controller cable is shortAll things considered, this is a must buy for any gamer, and especially those who are Nintendo fans.

Good but not great
Reviewed in Canada on May 14, 2017Edition: NESVerified Purchase
Before I get into the review of the product, I would like to point out that out of all of the online retailers, Amazon handled the very limited restock of the NES Classic the best. They restricted it to Prime members and it was a limit of 1 per customer for a specific period of time before you could re-order. The restock was also staggered and more units were released bit by bit on the same day instead of all at once. This gave many different people a chance to grab one. Many other online retailers released all of the stock at once and this led to many people not being fast enough to compete with the dedicated bots or canceled orders after purchase was confirmed which led to many disappointed Nintendo fans. I believe Amazon deserves some praise for enforcing restrictions for the re-stock.Now on to the NES Classic:There are 30 games built into this plug and play console by Nintendo and there is no way to expand the game count officially. Some people criticized Nintendo for this but I think 30 games was a good choice and an expansion would have made no sense since Nintendo claimed that this product would only have a limited release window. However, you did receive Nintendo's best first party titles for the console such as Mario, Zelda, Metroid and Kirby but you also got some well-regarded third party titles such as Mega Man 2, Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania, and Final Fantasy. Overall, the selection is just okay. Personally, some of the weaker titles such as: Castlevania 2, Balloon Fight, Galaga, Ice Climber, Mario Bros and Super C should have been removed and been replaced with: River City Ransom, Dragon Warrior 4, Contra, Bionic Commando, Duck Tales, and Gun Nac. Also, the Donkey Kong games should have been bundled as the Donkey Kong Classics game to save a slot.The build of the product is good for the most part. The console itself is solid with a working power and reset buttons. The controller is fantastic and has an excellent directional pad and very responsive buttons. The only problem with the build is that the cord for the controller is too short. If you are playing on a TV, you will need to either buy an extender for the controller or a USB or HDMI extender for the console if you want the console close to you so you can change games or use suspend points on the fly. I was disappointed that it only came with one controller. Nintendo could have saved on packaging if they just bundled an extra controller in and raised the price by $10. The Nintendo Classic was meant to be played with friends and many of the third party controllers available for the NES Classic cannot compare to the one Nintendo made.All the games are emulated on this console and if you do not enable Game Mode on your TV, you will encounter input lag which will make it very annoying to play games that require high precision such as the Super Mario Bros series. While the emulation is much better than what we saw on the Virtual Console for these games, it is by no means perfect. There are sound issues with Mega Man 2 that are very noticeable but the biggest issue is that anti-epilepsy protection in the emulator which makes one of the games, Punch-Out, too slow and therefore unbeatable. This has been tested extensively and the final boss cannot be beaten in that game. The menu interface that the emulator runs is great - it is aesthetically pleasing showcasing the game art and basic information for each game and the music is catchy. There are also different video options you can enable. Personally, I think you get the best experience with the 4:3 default setting.Pros:-Aesthetically pleasing (both the box and console)-The best first party titles are built-in-Easy to set up-Suspend points for tough games-Responsive controllerCons:-Emulation accuracy is the biggest con making one game unbeatable-Input lag if your TV does not have Game Mode-Third party titles could have been better-Controller length is too short (2 feet) but this can be remedied at a low cost-Second controller must be purchased separately (authentic Nintendo Classic controllers were rarer than the console itself)Overall, the Nintendo Classic is definitely worth the MSRP of 79.99 CAD but since it has been discontinued, it is next to impossible to find it for that price. Realistically, if you want to buy it from a re-seller, it is not worth more than $120.00 CAD. Out of the box, the accuracy issue with the emulator itself is very hard to overlook and the game selection for the third parties definitely needed to be better if you intend to play this console. If you are a collector and only collecting it for the aesthetics, then it might be worth more to you since it is an officially licensed Nintendo product and it looks very nice.

Disappointing
Reviewed in Canada on September 4, 2023Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Bought this for my son and he loved playing with it, but after one day we noticed it only shot 3 feet and then the spring came out and didn’t shoot at all.I ended up taking it apart, detangling the string from the inner spool and reassembled and it’s now working again. (Took me about 45 min) However, to have to disassemble a toy after one day is not ideal, especially after paying $66 for it. I don’t recommend buying.

It's a cool gadget, and worked well at first. But after only hours of playing with it, the string won't launch to full length and is stuck. Considering the price, I would expect better. And the glove is too small for an 8 year old boy. Will be returning it.

The battery lasts alot longer than I expected it to and I haven't had any issues running any of the games. It comes preloaded with all kinds of games but you also have the option to add more games via a computer. (Lots of tutorials online on how to do that for the miyoo mini). Highly recommend if you're looking for a starter retro gaming device!

The seller was great and got a replacement sent out and was received in under aweek. So buy a decent sd card and copy the files onto it or like one of the other reviews says go to joeys retro handhelds on youtube and follow his instructions for onion OS .  Having onion OS is 10x better and more reliable.  Im not very computer smart and i figured it out so im sure you can to!

With that in mind I'm happy with my purchase. This emulator is good quality all around, and plays everything I want to play really well.One thing to note, the provided screen protector is slightly smaller than the screen itself, but once installed it's obvious that it covers the actual screen, so long as you install the protector dead-center.I definitely recommend.

Excellent VR headset. I highly recommend for beginners.
Reviewed in Canada on March 17, 2024Style: Meta Quest 2 128GBVerified Purchase
It's a very affordable VR set that offers hours of fun if you have a few VR games to go along with it. I recommend getting a link cable and connecting it to your PC if you have a strong enough PC that can run VR games, like on Steam VR. The headset's games aren't bad, but they don't really come close to games like Skyrim VR with mods, Subnautica or Alien: Isolation. You can do many things with this headset, from visiting people in the Meta Verse to Netflix to training your cardio with apps and games available in the integrated app store.It's very intuitive and the tutorial game that comes with the headset covers pretty much anything you need to know. If you never used a VR headset, don't worry about it. It's more organic than a regular PC or console game. You get to learn how it works almost naturally.It seems quite durable. If you respect your self-imposed VR zone, you shouldn't hit anything with it. Be mindful of obstacles, pets and people in your environment. Personally I recommend having an outside noise as some kind of safety device ( ex: a fan ) to help you relocate yourself in the real world while you have the headset on, otherwise you may end up somewhere without even noticing it.Once again, you could potentially connect to your computer with a link cable and gain access to your desktop - yep, no need for a real keyboard or mouse - to fully use the potential of your Quest 2. It has an integrated mic that is very good.You may get VR sickness as I did when I first began using it ( it was my first VR experience ) but over time you will get used to it and the more you use it the longer you'll be able to play. You just need to stop when you feel dizzy, don't push yourself. Take a break every hour, especially when playing physically demanding games.Many movies on Youtube VR aren't very good quality but are still fun to watch - some may be a bit pixelised due to their weaker resolution. However you have a decent amount of free movies available within the Meta library itself which are very high quality and very entertaining and relaxing ( swimming with dolphins, traveling through space, and more ).The main question is: what will you invest in it? Because I think a lot of people will buy a VR headset and once the novelty runs off, they'll stop using it. So you need to think if you plan on gaming a lot with this thing to be worth it. You will need to buy at least a couple of games at some point to feel like you have something to do with this headset because the little free games won't be enough after a few days of playing.The only issue I have is the battery that won't last long - personally I'm always plugged in when I used it because otherwise the battery drains quite fast.

Best Christmas gift ever
Reviewed in Canada on January 4, 2024Style: Meta Quest 2 128GBVerified Purchase
Got this for my 10 yo daughter and 12 yo son for Christmas this year. They absolutely love it.  Was able to follow some you tube videos to put it in developer mode, load SideQuest app and get them access to many more free games. So much to chose from both in the Meta store and SideQuest app market. Their favorite games as of right now are Gorilla Tag and Job Simulator. Setup was more steps than I'd like but it guides you well. The environment is very fun. GUI is easy to use. Audio is very good. Visuals are very very nice and exciting. After finally getting a VR headset I definitely understand why they say VR is the future in visual entertainment. Everything from gaming to watching movies to actually doing work like design and architecture. I'm definitely a fan and so are my kids. They can hardly put it down.

First dive into VR
Reviewed in Canada on January 23, 2024Style: Meta Quest 2 128GBVerified Purchase
First I must say that the VR experience is amazing! This was my first dive into VR and it was mind blowing. It was visually incredible and made me totally car sick at the same time!I first tried the basic intro guides and tutorials and got the hang of it and decided to try the rollercoaster and I literally nearly barfed. It was so immersive that my brain couldn't figure out why my eyes were moving and my body wasn't.  I put it down for a few days and considered sending it back but I tried it again and played a bunch of free trial games and eventually got my 'VR legs"" and have been loving it ever since!As an ex-drummer in a band who had to give it up due to a back injury, games like Drum Quest, Ragnarok and Paradiddle got me right back on the throne and actually gave me a good work out that it helped with my back recovery. I then went into some boxing games and the exercise capabilities of VR were really realized!I love this and do not regret my purchase for one second (other than the motion sickness that has not returned after using it for a few weeks).

My go-to for my daily chronic pain & MIGRAINES
Reviewed in Canada on May 10, 2023Verified Purchase
I have been using Salonpas topical pain reliever patches for a few years now, and they have truly been a game-changer for me. As someone who battles both fibromyalgia and chronic migraines, finding effective pain relief has often felt like an endless quest. However, these patches have exceeded my expectations in more ways than one. Plus they are so affordable!First and foremost, Salonpas patches have become my faithful companion in managing the relentless pain of fibromyalgia. The discreet patches adhere securely to my skin, allowing me to experience targeted relief exactly where I need it most. I also like that I can immediately put on any of my braces on top of the patch, unlike topical creams. (see picture) Unlike other topical creams I've tried in the past, these patches provide lasting comfort that extends for hours. This longevity is especially crucial when dealing with fibromyalgia, as the pain can persist throughout the day and night. With Salonpas patches, I can confidently say goodbye to the constant reapplication of creams that never seem to last for me.Furthermore, when it comes to tackling my chronic migraines, these patches have proven to be a true godsend. The versatility of Salonpas patches allows me to apply them directly to the source of my pain, whether it's my forehead or the back of my neck. It may look funny, but it gets the job done! The soothing sensation that ensues is truly remarkable, as it eases the intensity of my migraines and provides a sense of relief that is often hard to come by. I appreciate how the patches effectively target the specific area, enabling me to carry on with my day without being held hostage by migraines. Depending upon where the migraine is I will sometimes cut the patches in half so they fit to the area better.Beyond the incredible pain relief they provide, I also admire the practicality and convenience of Salonpas patches. The packaging is compact and portable, making it easy for me to carry them in my purse or pocket, ensuring that relief is always within reach. The patches are quick and simple to apply, and their discrete nature allows me to wear them comfortably under clothing without drawing attention.Lastly, I must commend Salonpas for their commitment to quality. The patches are designed with a gentle adhesive that adheres firmly to the skin without causing any irritation or discomfort. This is particularly important for those with sensitive skin like myself, as I have experienced adverse reactions to other similar products in the past.

                My go-to for my daily chronic pain & MIGRAINES

            I have been using Salonpas topical pain reliever patches for a few years now, and they have truly been a game-changer for me. As someone who battles both fibromyalgia and chronic migraines, finding effective pain relief has often felt like an endless quest. However, these patches have exceeded my expectations in more ways than one. Plus they are so affordable!First and foremost, Salonpas patches have become my faithful companion in managing the relentless pain of fibromyalgia. The discreet patches adhere securely to my skin, allowing me to experience targeted relief exactly where I need it most. I also like that I can immediately put on any of my braces on top of the patch, unlike topical creams. (see picture) Unlike other topical creams I've tried in the past, these patches provide lasting comfort that extends for hours. This longevity is especially crucial when dealing with fibromyalgia, as the pain can persist throughout the day and night. With Salonpas patches, I can confidently say goodbye to the constant reapplication of creams that never seem to last for me.Furthermore, when it comes to tackling my chronic migraines, these patches have proven to be a true godsend. The versatility of Salonpas patches allows me to apply them directly to the source of my pain, whether it's my forehead or the back of my neck. It may look funny, but it gets the job done! The soothing sensation that ensues is truly remarkable, as it eases the intensity of my migraines and provides a sense of relief that is often hard to come by. I appreciate how the patches effectively target the specific area, enabling me to carry on with my day without being held hostage by migraines. Depending upon where the migraine is I will sometimes cut the patches in half so they fit to the area better.Beyond the incredible pain relief they provide, I also admire the practicality and convenience of Salonpas patches. The packaging is compact and portable, making it easy for me to carry them in my purse or pocket, ensuring that relief is always within reach. The patches are quick and simple to apply, and their discrete nature allows me to wear them comfortably under clothing without drawing attention.Lastly, I must commend Salonpas for their commitment to quality. The patches are designed with a gentle adhesive that adheres firmly to the skin without causing any irritation or discomfort. This is particularly important for those with sensitive skin like myself, as I have experienced adverse reactions to other similar products in the past. The fact that Salonpas patches are gentle, yet highly effective, sets them apart from the rest.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Salonpas topical pain reliever patches to anyone seeking relief from any sort of chronic pain, like fibromyalgia or chronic migraines or even injuries. These patches have become an essential part of my pain management routine, offering lasting comfort and targeted relief that surpasses traditional topical creams. With Salonpas patches, I no longer have to endure the relentless pain; instead, I can regain control of my life and embrace each day with renewed hope.

Reviewed in Canada on April 7, 2024Verified Purchase
This is an amazing product, just like I said. It comes in two packs, so it's easy for me to keep one at home and one at the office. It's very convenient to use and really helps relieve pain. It's strong enough to stay on even if I wash my elbow, and you can feel the heat for about 2 to 3 hours. It's very beneficial. I recommend it 1000%. It's a great product

PHENOMINAL !!
Reviewed in Canada on May 17, 2023Verified Purchase
I was somewhat skeptical when ordering these patches, but at the cheap cost - I thought what do I have to lose? My ex sister-in-law was visiting the whole family this spring from the UK. She is in her late 70's and has a few aches and pains. She showed me her daily pain/ache sticky patches from the UK. She said they worked but were expensive. Intrigued - I searched for similar here in Canada. Amazon link cropped up, and upon reading the reviews - went for it. I cannot praise these patches highly enough!  I would give them a 100 stars if I could!!  They stick well (too well on my poor achy neck muscles after working outside in the yard all day (I'm 79!) as they stuck to my short neck hair and talk about OUCH when pulling them off!  LOLI overdid the raking and really strained my Lats and stuck two either side of my lower back.  All I can say is WOW! They really really work. I've have now ordered the large size for that area as I tend to overdo things - thinking I am in my 30's. Anyway - get them! They are worth every cent! They smell great, they stick great, THEY WORK!

Minecraft swiftly arrived at our doorstep with free shipping, setting a positive tone from the get-go. For our 4 and 6-year-old dynamic duo, the game has become a haven of creativity and collaboration. Unlike many games today, Minecraft leans towards non-violence, making it a preferred choice for our little ones. They find joy in the Creative mode, where building houses, caves, farms, taming animals, and discovering resources become their daily adventures. It's impressive to witness our 6-year-old navigating menus independently and picking up on written words through this engaging and educational gaming experience. In a gaming landscape dominated by shooters, Minecraft stands out as a refreshing and enriching choice for kids.

Kid has been asking for this for a long time and I’ve been debating between the tablet version or the switch version.I have younger kids and I am not ready for them to play in multiplayer mode, so  without the Nintendo subscription, they cannot go online, so I don’t have to worry.But the negative thing is, I wish there is a tutorial to teach you how to use which controls with the game. They do have instructions, but I thought it would be easier if there was a guide through.Game is good overall, just I would actually prefer the tablet version over this.

Great looking set, from afar it looks like the real deal. I have hand-washed and rewashed them several times with no issues. The utensils are a little finickier in the wash - don't use a sponge with a scrubbing side or the silver becomes black. The only downside to this set is that the plates, while sturdy enough, are quite light... so if it's a windy day... WHOOOSH! You are left chasing down plates and utensils. All in all, good quality for the price!

Good quality and taste but much too sweet (stevia extract)
Reviewed in Canada on June 9, 2020Verified Purchase
I have purchased this brand before but the gummy version which I liked even although they were very sweet. It certainly beats trying to swallow huge capsules, which always sick in my throat and make me gag. The quality was excellent and I thought I was re-ordering the gummies but made a mistake and this arrived. I tried it over three days. Each time it stimulated appetite like other artificial sweeteners and was so unpalatably sweet I couldn't finish the drink.I'm diabetic and don't eat anything sweet at all, not even fruit, but also as a diabetic I need extra magnesium so the gummies were a trade-off. They were OK, soft and tasted delicious if overly sweet. The drink mix is another matter. I tried diluting it in twice the water and it helped a little - it's 2 tsp to a cup of water.The sweetener is stevia which is said to be natural and it is in its pure leaf form, but this is a lab extract and although it beats the other artificial sweeteners on the market, I find it overwhelming.It tastes like raspberry lemonade, refreshing and pleasant and it made the water slightly fizzy which was a nice touch. Most people will love this and the product is of excellent quality. My situation is in the definite minority so do give it a try.

Amazon Does it Again - Marginal Improvements in Sound, Touch Control and Better Clock Display
Reviewed in Canada on October 25, 2022Colour Name: CharcoalConfiguration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
The Echo Dot continues to be Amazon's most popular and affordable smart speaker  The New Gen 5 speaker looks identical  to the Gen 4 version however there are some key features inside that may be important to you and you should know about before purchasing.••• Design & Size •••This new Echo Dot Gen 5 speaker is the exactly the same size as the previous Gen 4 Speaker100mm x 100mm x 89mm.Both speakers share the same spherical design and are about the size of a softball.  (I’m not a big fan of the baseball shape but it looks like it’s here to stay for at least another generation).The new Gen 5 Speaker is noticeably heavier than the Gen 4 thanks to the new speaker and electronics inside328g - Gen 4340g - Gen 5Speaker:40.6 mm Full Range speaker in the Gen 4 Dot44.9 mm Full Range speaker in the Gen 5 DotThe Gen 5 Dot has a New High Excursion, Full Range Speaker inside, along with an Accelerometer and temperature sensor.••• Sound Quality •••Amazon claims the New Echo Dot Gen 5 has twice (2x) the bass and 50% less distortion.  I would agree that the new Gen 5 dot does have slightly more bass and marginally less distortion but the differences are subtle and certainly not jaw dropping.The Gen 5 Dot continues to compress heavy bass to enable the 44.9mm full range driver to handle the lower frequencies.  Compression increases the louder you turn the volume up and distortion is reduced slightly.  You still can't turn the volume up past 75% before the distortion is too much.The Echo Dot was intended to be a convenient, compact, inexpensive smart speaker … If you’re looking for better sound for music and streaming consider upgrading to the full size Echo Speaker or Echo Studio Gen 2.••• NEW FEATURES •••Temperature Sensor:Both models have a temperature sensor installed which can be used to trigger home automation devices and Alexa routines.  So for example you could turn a fan on when the temperature gets hotNew - Accelerometer:The Echo Dot now supports tap gestures thanks to a new accelerometer inside.  You can tap the top of the dot to pause and resume music, end a call or dismiss a timer or alarm.  Some users prefer tap gestures rather than voice commands.  Tapping is also better in the bedroom for example rather than using your voice to cancel the alarm and wake up your partner.New Processor:The Gen 5 Dot has a new AZ2 Neural Edge processor inside.  This makes the New Echo Dot faster and more responsive.  Many commands are processed locally on the device itself rather than in the cloud.  The new processor also provides more power for audio processing.Echo Dot with Clock:The echo dot with clock has a brand new 5x21 high density LED display which is both brighter and easier to read.  The Echo Dot Gen 5 with clock will display the time and date just like the Gen 4 but will also display the name of a song, artist, the weather, a calculator and more.The Echo Dot Gen 5 with clock is currently $20 more than the Echo Show 5.  The Echo Show 5 has a video screen which makes it an excellent alarm clock and more.  The Echo Show 5 sounds as good as the Echo Dot with Clock making the Show a better deal if you want an alarm clock Smart Speaker.No More 3.5MM Jack:The 3.5mm audio output jack has been removed from the New Echo Gen 5 Dot.  If you need a hardwired audio out jack you will want to get the Gen 4 Dot.  The New Gen 5 Dot only supports wireless bluetooth there is no hardwired output option.••• RECOMMENDATION •••The differences between the EchoDot  Gen 4 and Gen 5 from an audio perspective are minor and not worth paying a premium for.  Even with the new speaker larger speaker most users will not notice the difference and have a similar experience with either speaker.The Gen 4 Dot will quickly become a heavily discounted speaker so watch for it on Black Friday, Boxing Day, Prime Days and Deal of the Days while stock lasts.While the Gen 4 Dot will inevitably be cheaper there are some reasons you may with to purchase the Echo Gen 5 now.The display and features of the Gen 5 Dot with CLOCK are much better than the previous GEN 4 and well worth it.  I do not recommend buying the Gen 4 Dot with clock anymore … Get the Gen 5 Clock Dot or Echo Show 5 instead if you want a Smart Speaker Clock.Another reason to get the new Gen 5 Dot is for the Accelerometer which enables tap and touch controls.  These are very convenient and handy.If you’re just using the Echo Dot as a smart assistant and for background music then pick up the Gen 4 Dot when it's on sale.If you’re using your Echo devices for home automation or value the tap controls then the Gen 5 Dot is the one to get.

Totally Loving This Machine! Wow.  Just Like Gelato in Italy
Reviewed in Canada on October 6, 2022Style: BlackVerified Purchase
I recently went to Italy and part of the trip was to sample gelato at various places.  Funny thing is, everyone makes it differently--some no eggs, some lots of eggs, some small amounts of cream, others more cream.  I was keen to replicate what I had tasted in Italy and thought I would take a gamble on this machine.I already have an ice cream machine at home with the bowl that you freeze.  Had it for nearly 20 years.  Works fine for soft ice cream but requires to be turned while in the freezer for high sugar content ice creams.  Have used it for various ice creams, gelatos, and frozen desserts over the years with good and mixed results. It mostly turns out like soft serve.  This machine is totally different...You start by making a base, adding flavor, freezing it in two specially made canisters, then grinding it (best word I can think of) in this machine, then adding mix ins (nuts, chocolate chucks, candies, etc.).  Some people complain that you have to make stuff a day in advance.  Boo hoo, pony up and plan.  Actually, I found that freezing the canisters in a fridge freezer worked just fine after about 12 hours.So far I've used all the settings except smoothie (I'm not a smoothie guy that much and have a ninja blender for shakes anyway).  Still trying to figure out what a smoothie bowl is.  Last I checked I stopped eating baby food when I got teeth.So here is what I've made:1.  Nutella gelato using a semi custard base (meaning I used 1 egg yolk instead of three and used 1 tablespoon of corn starch to thicken it, used light cream to reduce the fat, and more milk)2.  Another flavor of gelato using a custard base (3 egg yolks, cream, milk).  Essentially this recipe was a frozen custard but called gelato (lots of different versions of gelato online)--so if you are frozen custard person, this machine might be for you--I hate paying store prices for frozen custard.3.  Salted caramel ice cream4.  Rum and raisin ice cream lite (used artificial flavoring and added the raisins as mix ins)5.  Strawberry sorbet (essentially strawberries packed in, no sugar added, ground in the machine)6.  Chocolate orange gelato7.  Maple, pecan ice cream8.  Chocolate malted milk ice cream.  We mixed this one then did a remix and it came out almost like a Wendy's frosty with a similar flavor.  I used malt syrup from the health food store.I have to say, the flavors and textures from this machine were EXACTLY like what I had in Italy for the gelatos (although the other settings aren't that much different).  I don't know how the genius designers came up with this thing but it is amazing!  I'm a skeptic and pessimist but I was shocked at this.Essentially this is how I understand it.  First, the contents get essentially ground then mixed.  This does the same job as a traditional ice cream machine (ice or frozen bowl, doesn't matter) as the intent of the continuous stirring of the bowl prevents large ice crystals from forming.  The grinding aspect of this machine (which is a bit quieter than a blender, but still a bit loud) does the same job but after the stuff is frozen.  You lock the canister inside another canister then lock those into place.  Hit the button and wait about 2 minutes.  Done.  Don't like the results, do it again on remix.Now, for all the flavors I tried, I did different things.  I got a couple off the internet for the machine (their website has some recipes), one or two from other sources, then made up the rest of my own.  I changed the ratios of milk, cream, eggs, sugar, and changed the thickeners on some to starch, egg yolks, full eggs, and guar gum to see how the machine would perform.  Seemed to work well.  Harder contents tend to make the machine sound a bit stressed but it was fine.  I also found that chopping the add-ins helped them mix them in.  The mixing went well with even distribution.  I also followed directions that said leave the canister out of the freezer for a few minutes or in the fridge for 20 minutes or so.  Doing so helped make a creamier product.  Not doing so, especially for lower fat ice cream, resulted in a crumbly texture that had to be remixed (one of the settings).  Then it came out like ice cream.Some people complain that the blades don't touch the bottom and sides of the canister.  No kidding, it would break the machine if they did.  Sounds like a first world problem.  Just mix it in with a spatula then remix if you have to.The size is about the size of a coffee machine.One thing I noticed, is that the products (less sorbets) come out heavier than commercial ice cream.  This is because there is no overwhip (air added).  I actually prefer the product from this machine over commercial ice creams because the product tastes richer, creamier, and thicker.I like the fact that the machine handles different densities of frozen product with reduced fat but keeps the flavor.  You can even make it healthy if you want with reduced cream and reduced eggs.  In fact, the sorbet was just fruit, no sugar, or other stuff.  Worked on the fruit like a Yo Nanas machine (which I also have).  But unlike that machine, you can't grind up big hunks of stuff like cookies in the Creami.I thought, ""well if this works to make gelato creamy, maybe it can do the same for hummus like my favorite shawarma place.""  Tried it with cooked chickpeas and other ingredients less garlic which I mixed in later (didn't want to flavor the canisters).  Tried it frozen too then melted it.  Didn't work so well for hummus.  The hummus was good, but not quite as creamy as my shawarma place that won't tell me how they do it.I thought that the 500ml canisters would be too small for 5 people.  Not the case, since the product is richer, smaller portions ensue.  I would like to get 4 more so I have a variety of canisters with various flavors but I'm not keen on spending $12 per canister.  That is the only disadvantage.I really love this machine and am glad I got it.

I was interested when it first debuted, but though it would be more hassle than it would be worth.  Boy was I wrong.  If you're like me and you ""stock up"" on strawberries in season and freeze them in vacuum sealed bags... you can have amazing strawberry ice cream with ""fresh"" strawberries any time you like.  Their strawberry recipe is really very tasty (who knew a little splash of lemon juice would be so important.)Be warned though, it is especially noisy.  Start it, and leave the room while it runs.  Other than that caveat it's been pretty great.  I've made the chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon bun as well as the strawberry and all are great.  The sorbet based on a single fruit is not as tasty as I had hoped, but I bet on a hot summer day it will still be a nice cool down.

I recently purchased the Ninja CREAMi and I absolutely love it! This product is so easy to use and makes the most delicious ice cream. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves to make their own frozen treats. However, there is one con (minus the star) that I have noticed. Although there are minimal parts to clean, the lid with the blade attachment is extremely difficult to clean thoroughly. I have to soak it with dish soap or else the cream that gets inside the lid gets pretty sticky and somewhat stinky. Also, our first machine broke within 2 weeks. But thankfully the replacement works well so far. Despite these minor drawbacks, I still think the Ninja CREAMi is a great investment for anyone who loves homemade ice cream.

I am a professional chef and I have been waiting for years for a company to make a home version of a pacojet that is cheaper. This is the product I have been waiting for. Very easy to use and produces very creamy ice cream and sorbets. A positive is that compared to the traditional home ice cream makers, the machine runs for around a minute thus you don't have the noise running in the background for long compared to the others which can be for an hour. The trade off is that you have to make your base the day before. Great value for what you are paying for, highly recommended.

If I switch hands, I sometimes go a page or two in the wrong direction. It’s a small annoyance.Also, I wished that kindle had more options for cases as I had to get a random one from Amazon.Now I would like Amazon to make one account for kindle and audible!

I got this from my hubby for our anniversary and I use it almost every day now. I've had it less than a month and I've already read 4 books, compared to reading maybe 1 in a year if I am lucky. I still have my paper books, because I love my collection, but if you have children, this is a must! My little one can't ruin books when she wants to climb all over me while I read. I can take it to the bath, beach (highly looking forward too).The battery life is pretty good, I've had to charge it once so far, and that's cause when it arrived it was at 40%, I haven't plugged it in since then and after a full charge it's been about a week and read 2 books, and the battery just reached 46%, which I'm impressed by.The only downside for me is not being able to ""move"" the books around in my own order, so it makes it a little tough to try and find the 1st book or the next etc. when you can't move it in that order, unless the cover tells you it's book 1, 2, etc.Other than that, I highly recommend this to any book lover, it helps me read books and determine if I want a paper copy amongst my collection. It's light weight, small and portable, has a light at the bottom to show it is charging, and you can customize the ""sleep"" screen to be the cover of the book you're currently reading, just overall a great product.

A game changer for book lovers!
Reviewed in Canada on July 31, 2023Style: Without Kindle UnlimitedDigital Storage Capacity: 8 GBColour: BlackVerified Purchase
I've been a die-hard book lover for as long as I can remember, but recently, I decided to give the Kindle Paperwhite 8GB a try to see what all the hype was about. Let me tell you, this little device has completely changed the way I read and interact with books.First and foremost, the 8GB storage capacity is perfect for me. I've loaded it up with hundreds of books, and there's still plenty of space left for more. The Paperwhite's sleek design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also incredibly lightweight, making it effortless to carry around wherever I go. It fits perfectly in my hand and doesn't strain my eyes, even during marathon reading sessions.The E-Ink display is the star of the show. The high-resolution screen provides a crisp and clear reading experience, akin to reading an actual paper book. The adjustable brightness allows me to read comfortably, whether it's in broad daylight or dimly lit rooms. Additionally, the built-in adjustable font size and font type feature are lifesavers for my aging eyesight, making reading a breeze.One of the Kindle Paperwhite's most impressive features is its waterproof design. I can now enjoy my favorite books poolside or in the bathtub without worrying about any accidental splashes ruining the device. It has truly become my perfect companion for vacations and travel, giving me access to an entire library on-the-go without weighing me down with heavy books.The battery life is impressive as well. I can easily go weeks without needing to charge it, and I'm an avid reader who uses the device every day. This extended battery life allows me to focus on enjoying my reading rather than constantly monitoring the charge level.The integration with Amazon's Kindle Store is seamless, allowing me to browse, purchase, and download books with just a few taps. The synchronization feature keeps track of my reading progress across devices, so I can seamlessly switch between my Kindle and the Kindle app on my phone or tablet without losing my place.If there's one thing I'd suggest for improvement, it would be the inclusion of a USB-C port for faster charging. While the micro-USB is reliable, an upgrade to the latest technology would be appreciated.Overall, the Kindle Paperwhite 8GB has transformed my reading experience in ways I couldn't have imagined. I still adore physical books, but the convenience and versatility of this e-reader have won me over. If you're an avid reader or just someone looking to enjoy books on a more portable and modern platform, the Kindle Paperwhite 8GB is an excellent investment that won't disappoint. I highly recommend it!

I've been using the Kindle Paperwhite for a few weeks now and I have mixed feelings about it.Pros:- The Paperwhite has a 6.8"" display with 300 ppi glare-free screen. This makes the text look sharp and easy to read, even in bright sunlight.- The Paperwhite is waterproof (IPX8) so you can read it in the bathtub or by the pool without worry.- The Paperwhite has a long battery life. I can usually get about 10 weeks of use out of a single charge.- The Paperwhite is lightweight and easy to carry around.- The dark mode is very convenient for reading at night.Cons:- The Paperwhite is a bit small. I would prefer a larger size, especially for reading large format books or PDFs.- I had some issues with syncing books online, so I was forced to transfer them via the USB cable.Overall:The Kindle Paperwhite is a good e-reader, but it's not perfect. If you're looking for a small, lightweight e-reader with a long battery life, the Paperwhite is a good option. However, if you prefer a larger screen you may want to consider a different e-reader.

Wow what a fabulous headphone.....advantage,  just one cord coming from the left side headset...The sound was night and day compared to my old headphones that I paid for more, like when you get a new vacuum cleaner after 12 years of the old one!. The phono jack end screws on at the end of the cord, which to me give a more positive fit. It folds up easy and comes with a nice leatherette bag. But the rich sound on so many levels, is clear and real and true, wow! I found out about them when I asked a friend who is a recording engineer, musician/writer and producer what type of mix down speakers should I buy for my home recording studio........he said forget about the speakers, just buy a good set of headphones. The MDR7506 Sony's are what he recommended, and the large Diaphragm really makes the sound expansive, full and rich. I do not think you can go wrong with these beauties...Nice price as well..Since I bought them I have noticed many large studios use them over other Headphones, even seen them on TV music documentaries. .

Great sound and build quality but a little uncomfortable
Reviewed in Canada on August 30, 2016Style: HeadphonesVerified Purchase
I bought a pair of these headphone after researching headphones for over a month. I wanted something in the $100-$150 range that sounded nice, was comfortable, didn't bleed noise, and were over-the-ear instead of on ear.I had read reviews saying that these headphones are extremely well balanced when it comes to sound - bass is not over powering, mids and highs sounds great. I've owned them for a month and a half now and after a lot of listening to music on it, I concur with those reviews. The sound is indeed very good. Much better than comparable headphones from Beats, Bose, Monster, and other such manufacturers. If you haven't owned a good professional-type headphones before, you will notice with these that your songs sound different because you can actually hear a lot of little things that get missed out on many other consumer headphones. So overall, for sound, I  really like it and it is more than worth the price.In terms of comfort, these are not quite over-the-ear headphones but they are certainly bigger than on-ear headphones. So they are good compromise in that terms. I did find, however, that wearing them for even an hour or so started to not just hurt my ears but give me a headache. This is mostly due to the fact that they fit tight to isolate the sound better - which it does a good job of. I decided to wait a few weeks to see if the headphones loosen up a little bit from being used regularly - which they did but I still can't wear them for longer than, at most, 2 hours at a time without getting a headache and having my ears hurt from the strong clamping of the ear cups. So if you want a pair of headphones for long sessions of comfortable listening, these may not be for you.In terms of style and build quality, I like them. They don't look attention-seeking, but rather, they have that understated tone to them. I personally quite like the look compared to Beats, for example. I personally like having the coiled cable as you can easily move around without worrying about pulling the cable. Which brings me to a little complaint about it - non replaceable cables. The cable is fixed and cannot be replaced. So if you yank it hard and break it, you'll have to send it in for repair. However, with the coiled cable, I think that would be a little harder to do. The weigh a little heavier than I expected but still not too heavy. I like the thinner headband, which is quite surprisingly comfortable.Packaging is good and easy to open as well. The headphones come with a 3.5mm to 1/4"" adapter as well that screws onto the 3.5mm end of the headphone's cable.So overall, this is my verdict:Pros:-Great sound quality-Well priced-Good sound isolation-Coiled cable helps prevent breaking the cable-Good build qualityCons:-Uncomfortable-Non-replaceable cable

But that's not a complaint of the quality of the headset, so I wouldn't take a star off. It's the slow mailing process by the seller - and Canada Post. Otherwise, can't go wrong with this headset!

Put this on the RV wall to track our travels. Love the fact that it’s laminated and that we can use the dry erase pen. pretty good level of detail, showing the major interstates, it even shows some interstate numbers. it’s two-sided, one is a bright and colourful side. The other is a bit more bland, but equally a good map. It would be a personal preference which side that you decide to display.

Can’t speak to the quality of the display output as it’s only being used on a cheap 60hz dell monitor, but the cable is good enough to display excel spreadsheets and analytics. I don’t like the clip design at all, but it works fine as a cheap DP adapter solution.

Super easy setup and learning to use. This is my first ever steering wheel purchase and I really have nothing bad I can say about it. I've had it for quite some time now and it works great. There were minor hurdles here and there but ultimately it came down to the connectivity most of the time. Great force feedback the pedals work great but keep in mind the acceleration pedal has no resistance so it is VERY hard to tell how much it's down. I also hear a squeak from it every time I turn and hold it right. Not too sure what's up with that but you get used to it eventually.

The Logitech G920
Reviewed in Canada on May 24, 2017Pattern Name: Xbox/PCStyle: WheelVerified Purchase
Alright let's get startedI put this order in on May 19th, 2017 and the package was expected to arrive the following Thursday. However, it came two days earlier which is great for me.On receiving the package, I immediately noticed that it was left in the box that it would be sold in at a store. The G920 box looked noticeably damaged on the outside, (scuff marks, punctured holes) and it appeared as the box was already opened as the carboard tabs on the lid were ripped off. I was a little nervous that the G920 would be damaged, however to my dismay it was in perfect condition.One thing you'll notice about the package when you open it up, it doesn't come with a shifter, just the pedals and wheel which to me I feel betrayed but at the same time satisfied. I had read online that the shifter felt cheaper and of lesser quality (also looking at online reviews and unboxings) and its prone to be worn out. Regardless of this, I'll be sticking with the paddle shifters on the wheel and maybe in a month I'll buy a thrust master shifter.The wheel itself is very nice, leather and steel which makes it look and feel like a real steering wheel (however the size of the wheel seems a bit smaller compared to a replica size one). Pedals feel like they are the real deal, with the breaks having actual resistance when pushed down onto along with the clutch and gas pedal.Overall quality is high and well received.Onto the gaming portion. For now I'm playing Assetto Corsa for the PC and it's a little tricky to find what settings you are comfortable driving with. I am constantly fine tuning my settings so I am able to get the most out of racing and more importantly; drifting. You can also download the Logitech software that's comparable with the wheel, and have even more access to settings to fine tune your driving experience.In conclusion, the Logitech G920 stands out on the driving simulator market as an entry level of driving gaming, and it's currently affordable as it is/was $100 off on Amazon.

Worked great until it didn't but Logitech replaced it so all good
Reviewed in Canada on January 2, 2023Pattern Name: Xbox/PCStyle: WheelVerified Purchase
We had the wheel for a few months when it started to not auto-centre without first turning it all the way to the left before plugging it in.  It also kept moving the centre to the right and the force feedback was fighting any turn to the left past centre.But Logitech support was great and helped me to try to diagnose it - they wound up sending us a replacement free of charge.I like the feel of the wheel and pedals - the brake pedal is too stiff but there are lots of videos about how to modify that for free or cheap.  Our cheaper unit has a gear shift but fewer buttons, and only two pedals - I like to use manual transmissions in BeamNG.  I wish it powered over the USB rather than needing a seperate power supply.  Once everything works with G-Hub it is easy to adjust and use - easy enough for my kids or wife to hook up without the dad tech help.

This is my second kindle. Although you always love your first, this ereader is pretty great. I love the glare free screen so I can read anywhere. The illuminated page on a dark plane was perfect, I could read clearly but not be blinded by the light.Easy to purchase books.Nice font.Good battery.Great size.Perfect weight.Fair price.I have to admit I don’t always love the touch screen. If I switch hands, I sometimes go a page or two in the wrong direction. It’s a small annoyance.Also, I wished that kindle had more options for cases as I had to get a random one from Amazon.Now I would like Amazon to make one account for kindle and audible! Before bed I could start a novel on my kindle and continue with audible when commuting in my car. Hope you’re listening Amazon, this could be a game changer!

I got this from my hubby for our anniversary and I use it almost every day now. I've had it less than a month and I've already read 4 books, compared to reading maybe 1 in a year if I am lucky. I still have my paper books, because I love my collection, but if you have children, this is a must! My little one can't ruin books when she wants to climb all over me while I read. I can take it to the bath, beach (highly looking forward too).The battery life is pretty good, I've had to charge it once so far, and that's cause when it arrived it was at 40%, I haven't plugged it in since then and after a full charge it's been about a week and read 2 books, and the battery just reached 46%, which I'm impressed by.The only downside for me is not being able to ""move"" the books around in my own order, so it makes it a little tough to try and find the 1st book or the next etc. when you can't move it in that order, unless the cover tells you it's book 1, 2, etc.Other than that, I highly recommend this to any book lover, it helps me read books and determine if I want a paper copy amongst my collection. It's light weight, small and portable, has a light at the bottom to show it is charging, and you can customize the ""sleep"" screen to be the cover of the book you're currently reading, just overall a great product.

A game changer for book lovers!
Reviewed in Canada on July 31, 2023Style: Without Kindle UnlimitedDigital Storage Capacity: 8 GBColour: BlackVerified Purchase
I've been a die-hard book lover for as long as I can remember, but recently, I decided to give the Kindle Paperwhite 8GB a try to see what all the hype was about. Let me tell you, this little device has completely changed the way I read and interact with books.First and foremost, the 8GB storage capacity is perfect for me. I've loaded it up with hundreds of books, and there's still plenty of space left for more. The Paperwhite's sleek design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also incredibly lightweight, making it effortless to carry around wherever I go. It fits perfectly in my hand and doesn't strain my eyes, even during marathon reading sessions.The E-Ink display is the star of the show. The high-resolution screen provides a crisp and clear reading experience, akin to reading an actual paper book. The adjustable brightness allows me to read comfortably, whether it's in broad daylight or dimly lit rooms. Additionally, the built-in adjustable font size and font type feature are lifesavers for my aging eyesight, making reading a breeze.One of the Kindle Paperwhite's most impressive features is its waterproof design. I can now enjoy my favorite books poolside or in the bathtub without worrying about any accidental splashes ruining the device. It has truly become my perfect companion for vacations and travel, giving me access to an entire library on-the-go without weighing me down with heavy books.The battery life is impressive as well. I can easily go weeks without needing to charge it, and I'm an avid reader who uses the device every day. This extended battery life allows me to focus on enjoying my reading rather than constantly monitoring the charge level.The integration with Amazon's Kindle Store is seamless, allowing me to browse, purchase, and download books with just a few taps. The synchronization feature keeps track of my reading progress across devices, so I can seamlessly switch between my Kindle and the Kindle app on my phone or tablet without losing my place.If there's one thing I'd suggest for improvement, it would be the inclusion of a USB-C port for faster charging. While the micro-USB is reliable, an upgrade to the latest technology would be appreciated.Overall, the Kindle Paperwhite 8GB has transformed my reading experience in ways I couldn't have imagined. I still adore physical books, but the convenience and versatility of this e-reader have won me over. If you're an avid reader or just someone looking to enjoy books on a more portable and modern platform, the Kindle Paperwhite 8GB is an excellent investment that won't disappoint. I highly recommend it!

Has adjustable backlight with warmth adjuster as well if that bright light is to strong. It can also be turned off if you prefer the natural book feel!I got the subscription for Kindle Unlimited and the book selection is great! the time frame for taking books out is indefinite and you just “return” them to the kindle store when you’re done or need more space on your kindle.The size is also great. Perfect for one handed reading. You can also adjust the size of text and font to your reading preference. Dark mode is also an option.

Reviewed in Canada on March 2, 2024Style: Without Kindle UnlimitedDigital Storage Capacity: 16 GBColour: BlackVerified Purchase
I've been using the Kindle Paperwhite for a few weeks now and I have mixed feelings about it.Pros:- The Paperwhite has a 6.8"" display with 300 ppi glare-free screen. This makes the text look sharp and easy to read, even in bright sunlight.- The Paperwhite is waterproof (IPX8) so you can read it in the bathtub or by the pool without worry.- The Paperwhite has a long battery life. I can usually get about 10 weeks of use out of a single charge.- The Paperwhite is lightweight and easy to carry around.- The dark mode is very convenient for reading at night.Cons:- The Paperwhite is a bit small. I would prefer a larger size, especially for reading large format books or PDFs.- I had some issues with syncing books online, so I was forced to transfer them via the USB cable.Overall:The Kindle Paperwhite is a good e-reader, but it's not perfect. If you're looking for a small, lightweight e-reader with a long battery life, the Paperwhite is a good option. However, if you prefer a larger screen you may want to consider a different e-reader.

When looking for supplements you want to find the highest quality with the cleanest ingredients without and fillers. Pure Encapsulations Magnesium Glycinate is arguably one of the best if not best Magnesium Glycinate on the market.Read the ingredients and you will see their are no dangerous or unnecessary fillers in this product. the capsules are bit on the larger side so if you have trouble swallowing bigger pills this may be an issue.Each capsule contains 120mg of Elemental Magnesium so you will need to take 3-4 to reach your daily recommended amount. Its also recommended you take this at night before bed with some food as if you take it without food it can upset your stomach. Also taking this at night will help you sleep more soundly.

In an era where digital devices have become an indispensable part of our lives, the Amazon Fire 7 Tablet emerges as a beacon of functionality, portability, and affordability. This 7-inch wonder effortlessly marries a sleek design with impressive features, promising an experience that far outweighs its modest price tag.The first thing that strikes you is the tablet's compact form factor. Weighing in as a feather-light companion, it's a testament to modern engineering that portability does not come at the cost of performance. The 7-inch display, while not the largest in the market, delivers vibrant colors and sharp visuals that make reading, streaming, and browsing an engaging affair.Under the hood, the 16 GB of storage may seem conservative, but Amazon's cloud integration and the option to expand storage via a microSD card ensure that your digital world remains expansive. The quad-core processor might not rival flagship devices, yet it performs admirably well for daily tasks, multitasking, and even some casual gaming. The real beauty, however, lies in the seamless integration with Amazon's ecosystem.The Fire 7 Tablet's battery life is a true revelation. Boasting up to 10 hours of mixed-use battery life, this device refuses to bow down even during the busiest of days. Whether you're engrossed in an eBook, binge-watching your favorite series, or fine-tuning a presentation, this tablet's longevity ensures you stay productive and entertained throughout.One of the most remarkable aspects of the Amazon Fire 7 Tablet is its democratization of technology. With an accessible price point, it brings the digital world closer to those who might have been left out due to financial constraints. It serves as an educational tool, an entertainment hub, and a communication lifeline for individuals of all walks of life.Admittedly, no device is without its limitations. The camera quality, while sufficient for video calls, might not impress photography enthusiasts. Additionally, the Amazon Appstore, while extensive, might lack a few niche applications available in other ecosystems. However, the tablet's prime focus remains on accessibility, functionality, and connectivity, aspects where it unquestionably excels.In conclusion, the Amazon Fire 7 Tablet emerges as an embodiment of the company's commitment to enhancing the lives of its users. With its blend of affordability, performance, and Amazon-centric features, it redefines what a budget-friendly tablet can achieve.

When my old Kobo and then my old Ipad stopped working for reading I was looking for something updated and not too expensive.  I did a ton of research and this tablet was the clear winner.  If you are looking for something to primarily read on and can utilize all the Canadian library apps, this is the tablet for you.  Is it as fancy as an ipad or kobo, no, but it is also so much cheaper!  It is also really sturdy, which is a consideration as I plan on taking this on vacations and whenever I travel.  It is great for watching shows as well which is something I originally didn't think I would use it for.  My only regret is not buying this when it was on sale for 10 bucks cheaper.  It is well worth the money!

Affordable and Efficient - Amazon Fire 7 Delivers on Essentials
Reviewed in Canada on January 23, 2024Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBConfiguration: Without Special OffersColour Name: DenimStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase
The Amazon Fire 7 tablet (2022 release) is a testament to how far budget tablets have come. Priced under $60, it provides a decent blend of features and performance that is hard to ignore for casual users or those needing a secondary device.Starting with its screen, the 7-inch display offers an acceptable viewing experience. With a resolution that is fine for reading and watching videos, it's not the sharpest on the market, but it's certainly serviceable considering the price point. I rate the screen quality at 3 out of 5, as it meets the basic requirements but doesn't excel.The battery life is one of the stronger aspects of this tablet. Offering up to 10 hours of usage is impressive for a device in this price range. It's more than enough to get through a day of moderate use, making it a reliable companion for long commutes or travel. I give it a solid 4 out of 5 for battery life.Where this tablet really shines is in its value for money. It's hard to find a tablet that offers a decent experience at this price. For basic tasks like browsing, reading, and streaming, it does the job well without breaking the bank. Therefore, I'd rate it 4 out of 5 for value for money.Overall, the Amazon Fire 7 (2022) earns a 3.5 out of 5. It's not a powerhouse by any means, but it's an excellent choice for those who need a simple, cost-effective tablet for everyday tasks. Whether it's for a child's first tablet, a device for reading, or just something to use on the go, it covers the basics with a competence that's hard to argue against at its price.

.. I would.The device is slow, often lags or hangs, further made worse by bloated apps that cannot be removed (or really turned off, as they are automatically turned back on). The App store is virtually devoid of any useful/popular apps, often only offers links to web versions of those apps, app notifications are virtually non-existent. You can hack the UI to allow for Google Play installation, but that just seems to make the device even slower - still will not allow you to remove/disable the bloatware and you will not get any notifications from those apps.I initially got this to do a bit of e-book reading, follow my sports pools while watching tv, and some basic card-type games (not resource intense games). And maybe look up a few things on the web. This device barely can handle that low level of use without freezing or hanging.Spend the extra $20 and get a real (refurb) tablet.

This is a good product. I feel calmer and am sleeping much more peacefully. I take it a couple hours before bedtime. Only complaint is that it's a fairly large capsule and sometimes I have a hard time swallowing it. I tried opening the capsule and mixing it with various sweet things like honey but it tastes awful. I now just take it and hope that it doesn't lodge itself on the way down.

Totally Loving This Machine! Wow.  Just Like Gelato in Italy
Reviewed in Canada on October 6, 2022Style: BlackVerified Purchase
I recently went to Italy and part of the trip was to sample gelato at various places.  Funny thing is, everyone makes it differently--some no eggs, some lots of eggs, some small amounts of cream, others more cream.  I was keen to replicate what I had tasted in Italy and thought I would take a gamble on this machine.I already have an ice cream machine at home with the bowl that you freeze.  Had it for nearly 20 years.  Works fine for soft ice cream but requires to be turned while in the freezer for high sugar content ice creams.  Have used it for various ice creams, gelatos, and frozen desserts over the years with good and mixed results. It mostly turns out like soft serve.  This machine is totally different...You start by making a base, adding flavor, freezing it in two specially made canisters, then grinding it (best word I can think of) in this machine, then adding mix ins (nuts, chocolate chucks, candies, etc.).  Some people complain that you have to make stuff a day in advance.  Boo hoo, pony up and plan.  Actually, I found that freezing the canisters in a fridge freezer worked just fine after about 12 hours.So far I've used all the settings except smoothie (I'm not a smoothie guy that much and have a ninja blender for shakes anyway).  Still trying to figure out what a smoothie bowl is.  Last I checked I stopped eating baby food when I got teeth.So here is what I've made:1.  Nutella gelato using a semi custard base (meaning I used 1 egg yolk instead of three and used 1 tablespoon of corn starch to thicken it, used light cream to reduce the fat, and more milk)2.  Another flavor of gelato using a custard base (3 egg yolks, cream, milk).  Essentially this recipe was a frozen custard but called gelato (lots of different versions of gelato online)--so if you are frozen custard person, this machine might be for you--I hate paying store prices for frozen custard.3.  Salted caramel ice cream4.  Rum and raisin ice cream lite (used artificial flavoring and added the raisins as mix ins)5.  Strawberry sorbet (essentially strawberries packed in, no sugar added, ground in the machine)6.  Chocolate orange gelato7.  Maple, pecan ice cream8.  Chocolate malted milk ice cream.  We mixed this one then did a remix and it came out almost like a Wendy's frosty with a similar flavor.  I used malt syrup from the health food store.I have to say, the flavors and textures from this machine were EXACTLY like what I had in Italy for the gelatos (although the other settings aren't that much different).  I don't know how the genius designers came up with this thing but it is amazing!  I'm a skeptic and pessimist but I was shocked at this.Essentially this is how I understand it.  First, the contents get essentially ground then mixed.  This does the same job as a traditional ice cream machine (ice or frozen bowl, doesn't matter) as the intent of the continuous stirring of the bowl prevents large ice crystals from forming.  The grinding aspect of this machine (which is a bit quieter than a blender, but still a bit loud) does the same job but after the stuff is frozen.  You lock the canister inside another canister then lock those into place.  Hit the button and wait about 2 minutes.  Done.  Don't like the results, do it again on remix.Now, for all the flavors I tried, I did different things.  I got a couple off the internet for the machine (their website has some recipes), one or two from other sources, then made up the rest of my own.  I changed the ratios of milk, cream, eggs, sugar, and changed the thickeners on some to starch, egg yolks, full eggs, and guar gum to see how the machine would perform.  Seemed to work well.  Harder contents tend to make the machine sound a bit stressed but it was fine.  I also found that chopping the add-ins helped them mix them in.  The mixing went well with even distribution.  I also followed directions that said leave the canister out of the freezer for a few minutes or in the fridge for 20 minutes or so.  Doing so helped make a creamier product.  Not doing so, especially for lower fat ice cream, resulted in a crumbly texture that had to be remixed (one of the settings).  Then it came out like ice cream.Some people complain that the blades don't touch the bottom and sides of the canister.  No kidding, it would break the machine if they did.  Sounds like a first world problem.  Just mix it in with a spatula then remix if you have to.The size is about the size of a coffee machine.One thing I noticed, is that the products (less sorbets) come out heavier than commercial ice cream.  This is because there is no overwhip (air added).  I actually prefer the product from this machine over commercial ice creams because the product tastes richer, creamier, and thicker.I like the fact that the machine handles different densities of frozen product with reduced fat but keeps the flavor.  You can even make it healthy if you want with reduced cream and reduced eggs.  In fact, the sorbet was just fruit, no sugar, or other stuff.  Worked on the fruit like a Yo Nanas machine (which I also have).  But unlike that machine, you can't grind up big hunks of stuff like cookies in the Creami.I thought, ""well if this works to make gelato creamy, maybe it can do the same for hummus like my favorite shawarma place.""  Tried it with cooked chickpeas and other ingredients less garlic which I mixed in later (didn't want to flavor the canisters).  Tried it frozen too then melted it.  Didn't work so well for hummus.  The hummus was good, but not quite as creamy as my shawarma place that won't tell me how they do it.I thought that the 500ml canisters would be too small for 5 people.  Not the case, since the product is richer, smaller portions ensue.  I would like to get 4 more so I have a variety of canisters with various flavors but I'm not keen on spending $12 per canister.  That is the only disadvantage.I really love this machine and am glad I got it.

This is more enjoyable than I expected

I was interested when it first debuted, but though it would be more hassle than it would be worth.  Boy was I wrong.  If you're like me and you ""stock up"" on strawberries in season and freeze them in vacuum sealed bags... you can have amazing strawberry ice cream with ""fresh"" strawberries any time you like.  Their strawberry recipe is really very tasty (who knew a little splash of lemon juice would be so important.)Be warned though, it is especially noisy.  Start it, and leave the room while it runs.  Other than that caveat it's been pretty great.  I've made the chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon bun as well as the strawberry and all are great.  The sorbet based on a single fruit is not as tasty as I had hoped, but I bet on a hot summer day it will still be a nice cool down.

I recently purchased the Ninja CREAMi and I absolutely love it! This product is so easy to use and makes the most delicious ice cream. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves to make their own frozen treats. However, there is one con (minus the star) that I have noticed. Although there are minimal parts to clean, the lid with the blade attachment is extremely difficult to clean thoroughly. I have to soak it with dish soap or else the cream that gets inside the lid gets pretty sticky and somewhat stinky. Also, our first machine broke within 2 weeks. But thankfully the replacement works well so far. Despite these minor drawbacks, I still think the Ninja CREAMi is a great investment for anyone who loves homemade ice cream.

I am a professional chef and I have been waiting for years for a company to make a home version of a pacojet that is cheaper. This is the product I have been waiting for. Very easy to use and produces very creamy ice cream and sorbets. A positive is that compared to the traditional home ice cream makers, the machine runs for around a minute thus you don't have the noise running in the background for long compared to the others which can be for an hour. The trade off is that you have to make your base the day before. Great value for what you are paying for, highly recommended.

When using throughout the day I am wanting to plug it in when I get home.  Otherwise: the phone is great and I will likely buy used from this seller again.But why did they send it in a random box with an IPHONE CHARGING CABLE?!  That makes no sense.  I had cords from previous phones, but if I am spending just over $300 (CDN) on a phone shouldn't I at least get one cord to charge it with?  Odd mistake to make, but still a great phone.

So, after unboxing the phone the only discernable defect were a couple very minor scratches, even could be classified as scuffs as they weren't deep or noticable until the phone was tilted in just the right light and angle.  So in terms of the condition, it was as advertised (at least in appearance) as ""like new"" / excellent.  It came with Android 13, had no bloatware, was unlocked, the battery was low, which means the phone was sitting awhile dormant, which may be a bad thing, but so far so good, it charged and seems to be holding onto the charge fine.  Overall this was a great deal, I got it for my mom as her new phone, I may pick another one up for myself.So i did get a second, and didnt have as good luck ... The battery is quick to discharge and slow to charge

Super easy setup and learning to use. This is my first ever steering wheel purchase and I really have nothing bad I can say about it. I've had it for quite some time now and it works great. There were minor hurdles here and there but ultimately it came down to the connectivity most of the time. Great force feedback the pedals work great but keep in mind the acceleration pedal has no resistance so it is VERY hard to tell how much it's down. I also hear a squeak from it every time I turn and hold it right. Not too sure what's up with that but you get used to it eventually.

The Logitech G920
Reviewed in Canada on May 24, 2017Pattern Name: Xbox/PCStyle: WheelVerified Purchase
Alright let's get startedI put this order in on May 19th, 2017 and the package was expected to arrive the following Thursday. However, it came two days earlier which is great for me.On receiving the package, I immediately noticed that it was left in the box that it would be sold in at a store. The G920 box looked noticeably damaged on the outside, (scuff marks, punctured holes) and it appeared as the box was already opened as the carboard tabs on the lid were ripped off. I was a little nervous that the G920 would be damaged, however to my dismay it was in perfect condition.One thing you'll notice about the package when you open it up, it doesn't come with a shifter, just the pedals and wheel which to me I feel betrayed but at the same time satisfied. I had read online that the shifter felt cheaper and of lesser quality (also looking at online reviews and unboxings) and its prone to be worn out. Regardless of this, I'll be sticking with the paddle shifters on the wheel and maybe in a month I'll buy a thrust master shifter.The wheel itself is very nice, leather and steel which makes it look and feel like a real steering wheel (however the size of the wheel seems a bit smaller compared to a replica size one). Pedals feel like they are the real deal, with the breaks having actual resistance when pushed down onto along with the clutch and gas pedal.Overall quality is high and well received.Onto the gaming portion. For now I'm playing Assetto Corsa for the PC and it's a little tricky to find what settings you are comfortable driving with. I am constantly fine tuning my settings so I am able to get the most out of racing and more importantly; drifting. You can also download the Logitech software that's comparable with the wheel, and have even more access to settings to fine tune your driving experience.In conclusion, the Logitech G920 stands out on the driving simulator market as an entry level of driving gaming, and it's currently affordable as it is/was $100 off on Amazon.

Worked great until it didn't but Logitech replaced it so all good
Reviewed in Canada on January 2, 2023Pattern Name: Xbox/PCStyle: WheelVerified Purchase
We had the wheel for a few months when it started to not auto-centre without first turning it all the way to the left before plugging it in.  It also kept moving the centre to the right and the force feedback was fighting any turn to the left past centre.But Logitech support was great and helped me to try to diagnose it - they wound up sending us a replacement free of charge.I like the feel of the wheel and pedals - the brake pedal is too stiff but there are lots of videos about how to modify that for free or cheap.  Our cheaper unit has a gear shift but fewer buttons, and only two pedals - I like to use manual transmissions in BeamNG.  I wish it powered over the USB rather than needing a seperate power supply.  Once everything works with G-Hub it is easy to adjust and use - easy enough for my kids or wife to hook up without the dad tech help.

Good kit printer
Reviewed in Canada on October 13, 2018Verified Purchase
Ordered this as a first 3D printer.I'd suggest this model to anyone that likes DIY and is comfortable with some basic assembly work - this is not a ""plug and play"" device. Putting this thing together was about as complicated as building a table from IKEA. The included assembly manual *is* lacking - specifically it does not tell you what screws to use where and could use some additional steps when it comes to assembling the X-Carriage/Hot End just to make the belt installation a bit easier to understand. I had to adjust my Y-stop out of the box and there is definitely room for some improvements; but again this is a kit - if you go in expecting to tinker it's fun, not frustrating. Most of the basic improvements can also be printed and files are easily available. I strongly recommend printing a filament guideI'd also suggest taking the time to learn how to assemble this thing and how to level the bed through Youtube or a community forum like Reddit as the instructions could be better there too. Print a calibration cube and temperature tower, not the included ""test dog"" file, this is a much better use of the included filament.Is this printer worth the extra $80 over the base model? For me it is - the newer hot end model, beefier Y axis and name brand power supply all are definite improvements and worth the extra. The removable bed is okay, but you're only gonna print PLA on it.The printer is open source, highly up-gradable and can grow with your needs - don't expect to print anything but PLA out of the box and don't expect perfect results until you get the settings dialed in. This is a small scale manufacturing device,  not an ink-jet.Oh, and buy at least one additional roll of PLA - you'll need it once you start making stuff.

Take your time building it and you'll get great results.
Reviewed in Canada on May 16, 2019Verified Purchase
Took about an hour and a half for me to assemble. I followed Tom Tullis's build guide from Fat Dragon Games and I was printing flawlessly out of the box. Some steps were a bit frustrating and I couldn't imagine doing it without another pair of hands, but with patience and someone to hold the pieces while you screw them in it's fairly straight forward. All needed tools come in the box and the only skill you need is the ability to use an allen key and a wrench.Some people have issues with salmon skinning but it hasn't been an issue for me. Coming from a MP Select Mini V2 I was floored with the quality. All I've done to the printer is replace the bowden fittings and the plastic extruder with a metal one and that's it. Layer lines that were very pronounced on my Mini are basically invisible so prints take very very little sanding. Bridging too is much better than my Mini and I'm needing much less support material. The removable build surfaceThe removable build plate is very convenient and makes removing prints from the build surface incredible easy. Just remove it from the steel base, and flex it off. It takes what was a 2 minute job on my Mini to a 2 second job on my Pro. Very nice.The build area isn't massive, but it's a pretty decent size. You can't get anything bigger in this price range and I'm very rarely limited by my build volume. Most figures or knick knacks will fit just fine in here. The only things I want to print one day but can't on this printer is a literal playable violin. Cosplayers may also not find this printer suitable, and you'll really want something like a CR10 to get that larger build volume.One issue I did have was with the included Micro SD card. In two words: it's garbage. Throw it out. I was having problems where the printer would stop printing half way through, and I couldn't figure out why. I replaced the SD card and the problem was solved. If you order this, buy an SD card with it. You'll thank me later.Another preventative measure thing you'll want to do is replace the bowden tube fittings and the extruder with an all metal one. They're not expensive (I payed $10 each) and it'll save you a world of hurt. If the couplings included on the Ender 3 ever fail (which they will because they're crap) then the hot end will fill with molten plastic and create a nasty clog that is hard to fix. Save yourself the trouble and replace it immediately. Now you can use the plastic extruder for a while, but I was about a roll of filament (Hatchbox White PLA) in when I noticed the extruder starting to wear.  Another roll in and the filament snapped going in because the angle was too sharp due to wear. I replaced the extruder and fittings both at the same time and it took 10 minutes. It's easy to do and well worth it.There are many more upgrades that would be considered ""nice to have"" but not 100% necessary. 3d printing cable chains for the hot bed wiring, a handle for the hot bed, a change to capricorn PTFE bowden tubing, adding TL smoothers to the XY stepper motors, a better spool holder, better bed springs so it needs to be leveled less often, ect. That said most of these are very very easy to do later and won't cause catastrophic failure if you wait a bit to do them like the couplings will.I have tried printing some filaments other than PLA onthis machine, but it doesn't seem to work very well. I tried ABS and TPU and neither worked particularly well. If you want to print those, I'd recommend not buying this printer as it really seems to be a PLA only machine. I've heard the Anycubic i3 Mega is better at printing those, but I haven't used that printer so your mileage my vary.Overall I'm extremely happy with this printer. It is a kit so be prepared to spend an afternoon assembling it. Don't rush this. It's easier to get everything dialed in while it's disassembled rather than it's all put together. Is it beginner friendly? Sure I don't see why not I mean it'll take a bit of research to get going but most printers will. Even printers that are easier to assemble (Anycubic i3 Mega) or don't require any assembly at all (MP Select Mini V2) will have things go wrong, and when they do at least with the Ender 3 you'll have a general idea how to tackle some of these problems since you built the thing. I was absolutely floored with the print quality i got out of this printer and would 100% recommend it to anyone looking to start on their 3d printing journey.

Perfect for my needs
Reviewed in Canada on September 7, 2023Style: Premium PenSize: 64 GBConfiguration: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase
I got this Kindle Scribe after debating for weeks: do I really need this? will this enhance my life? I really had to justify the price because it is a bit expensive. If you can wait until it's on sale, I recommend you do.It's perfect for me and I have no regrets. I read on a Kindle paperwhite 99% of the time, and I like taking handwritten notes for work because I have a tendency to forget to check note files on my computer. On my phone too, there are so many distractions that I never use my planners or productivity apps. But the Kindle Scribe works perfectly because of how streamlined the features are. Am I reading, shopping for books, or taking notes? I can't get distracted by books when I am taking notes, and I don't get distracted by my notebooks when I am reading. It's perfect.After the updates, the different pens, pressure sensitivity, sizes, lasso tool etc, I have to say the notebook experience is top tier. When using the pencil, you can even do some basic sketching as it detects when the pencil is held on the side or the tip so you can make a variety of lines and the pressure sensitivity feels great.If you are on the fence, I say go for it. I am now using it for everything. I don't always use it to read as I find a Paperwhite with a pop socket is more portable and comfortable for reading most of the time, but I love that I can bring this with my laptop at a cafe and work, take reading breaks, annotate PDFs, etc.If you send your PDFs via Send To Kindle (specifically), you can write on them! I downloaded a bunch of workbooks in PDF format and have been using them to learn languages this way instead of a physical workbook. It's great. You can erase, trace letters (if learning a language with a different alphabet). It is also amazing if like reading graphic novels because of the larger screen size.10/10

I always wanted a bigger screen KIndle and the Scribe meets all my expectations. It's fast, easy to hold and has a gorgeous screen. I'll probably not be taking much advantage of the writing capabilities, but never say never. What I tested so far works very well, though I would fall back to my iPad Pro for any writing/drawing needs for now. The touch screen is very responsive and fast. Quite the change from my old KIndle Paperwhite (one of the first models, so I can't speak of the current generation). It's expensive for what I'll use it for, just reading books, but I have no complaints. So far it's met all my expectations and some. If you want a clean, fast and large screen book reader with excellent note taking capabilities, this is it.

Well thought out but it needs to grow to be useful...
Reviewed in Canada on December 5, 2022Style: Premium PenSize: 64 GBConfiguration: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase
I received the Scribe a few days ago. I was especially interested in the online reviews which I have found have some glaring omissions or maybe gloss-overs -  one omission specifically concerning the notes function might mean I will be returning this unit.Hardware: The hardware is excellent with the exception that there appears to be a slight uneven gap between the metal border and the screen. On my unit, it is wider on one side, and narrow and snug on the other. This may be just my unit and is not a show-stopper for me. Just an observation. The unit is easy to hold. It is lighter than I was expecting.As an eReader: Amazon has this down pat. The larger screen, I have to say, makes reading much more enjoyable. I didn't think it would make a difference but it is huge. If it was a unit with just the larger screen at about 2/3 of the current price it would be a recommended purchase hands down.As a notetaker: The Good - the pen is amazingly comfortable and the screen and pen are as good a simulation of paper and pen as I have ever experienced. It is simply a pleasure to write on the Scribe. No it is more than pleasurable; it is nothing short of perfection. The pen is the best pen I have ever used on a tablet. It has good weight and fits into the hand without error. And the palm rejection is perfect as far as I am concerned. No errant marks.The Bad and needs to be improved: The note-taking is good. And I am not going to dock the lack of writing recognition, as many reviewers have focused on because my experience with it has been hit-and-miss anyway.But once you get more than one page of notes there is no menu that creates thumbnails to enable you quickly to jump back and forth through your notes. You have to scroll through them full-page by full-page until you get to where you want to be. This is a horrendous mistake by Amazon and makes the Scribe, as a note-taker, next to useless. All my notes range from 10 to 40 pages and having no quick way to jump through the document is seriously short-sighted. I am sure Amazon will correct this with a software update but right now the lack of this feature severely hinders the Scribe. The faster Amazon corrects this glaring error the better.As a Gen 1 product, the Scribe is excellent and it ticks almost all my boxes save one. However, the lack of that one feature severely reduces the utility of the Scribe for me and I assume for others who plan on using this as a replacement for pen and notepad.(If this unit has this feature and I have somehow overlooked it, please direct me to it and I will amend my review.)Update: The first major update has been released and my disappointment in the Scribe grew. The only additions to the notebook feature are a Go To page and nested folders. What I was really looking forward to was a thumbnail feature for my notes where I could navigate my notes by thumbnail. Giving me a Go To page feature is not useful at all. So my original review stands - as a larger e-reader it is very good. However, as a notetaking productivity device, the Scribe stills falls woefully short. If I could return it I would and I would encourage anyone thinking of buying it for notetaking to look elsewhere.Update 2: After a couple of updates you now see the pages in your notebooks in thumbnails and can navigate to the page you want. It makes note-taking that much more effective. Amazon is heading in the right direction with this product. It can only get better from here. I have changed my review to 4 stars. A definite buy if it suits your purpose.

Decided to use this because after a few hours, tats hurt. I couldn't believe the difference it made. You can barely feel it, literally. It only lasts about 1.5 hours after it's washed off.  So here is how the process goes: you want this to be applied at least 1 hour before your start tattooing, so you need to know how long it's going to take you to get there, and get the stencil applied etc.  I haven't time it, but I don't think you want to be waiting several hours before starting. If you live close by and will be getting right into it, then ensure application is minimum 1 hour prior.  HOT SHOWER first, to open pores up (or hot wash ... whatever).  Apply generously to tattoo area but not so much to waste it. Cut Saran wrap (plastic food wrap) and use first aid tape to stick the wrap over the area. When you arrive at your appointment, they are going to remove the wrap and wash you. HUGE TIP: If you are going to be doing a large area, consider using smaller sections of plastic wrap so they can be taken off at different times, say, 2 hours apart.  My last appointment lasted 8 hours, and after the 2 hour mark I started suffering lol. Wish I had done smaller sections that could be taken off as we progressed.  Great stuff. Pricey, but worth it for long sessions or smaller ones if you can't handle it.

Works, but not very long
Reviewed in Canada on March 17, 2024Verified Purchase
The short review: it worked for 1.5 hoursThe long review:I took these steps - I took a long hot shower and shaved the area in the shower. I got out, dried off and immediately applied a generous, very thick coat over the area and wrapped it tightly with suran wrap 1hr before my tattoo was to begin… I drove to my appointment and once there while waiting for my artist to set up I put a heat pack on the area (over my shirt) for the last 10 minutes before we started… I unwrapped and let it air out for about 5 minutes, then the artist wiped it off and we began…The first line was 100% pain free, it felt like a vibrating ball point pen. From then on it progressively wore off, the first 45 minutes being mostly pain free, then it started to rapidly wear off… at about the 1hr mark it became painful, and by 1.5” hours the effect was almost completely gone…Some other notes:- This was my second session on this tattoo on my stomach/front rib cage, the first session I did not use any numbing agents, so this review is a direct comparison to the same areas of the same tattoo, with and without this numbing cream.- I experienced swelling when using the numbing cream that I didn’t in the first session without it, the artist noted having to work the ink in a little bit more that last time because of this.- after it wore off, I felt the pain of the current needle stokes along with a rapid onset of the pain from all the work done up to that point… if you’re not cognizant of this it can make it seem like the cream is now making the pain worse than “normal”, but it’s not.In conclusion:I’d definitely use it again for short and medium appointments, short appointments will be easy as pie and for medium appointments it will give you a good head start … long appointments I don’t think it will make much better in the end as the swelling it causes may end up making it longer and harder anyway… I’m 35 years old now and not trying to be a tough guy anymore so 2-3 hour appointments are manageable and the logical option for quality work anyways.

Works wonders, BUT for 2 hours MAX
Reviewed in Canada on August 1, 2023Verified Purchase
Product is wonderful and works wonders, if you use properly.I was going to get a big piece on my LEFT thigh, and after taking one already on the right thigh I knew the session was going to be painful. So I got this product as it seemed the one with better reviews.I rinsed the thigh with plenty of hot water (I don't have much body hair, so I didn't need to shave), dried it with a hairdryer, applied a generous layer of the product, wrapped it in plastic bandage, put the dryer on longer, left it very hot, because that's what I understood in summary all the recipes I've seen. I went by car, to preserve the plastic well, with my leg wrapped in a blanket, and with the car seat heater on until then. I kept it warm until it was time to remove the plastic, when I got to the studio.Right before applying the stencil, I applied a more of the product and left it without plastic for about 20 minutes - I've practically used the whole tube during whole process.I felt ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in the first 2 hours of the session, but the tattoo artist had already warned you, for large pieces this is a problem because by the time the effect wears off, the pain you will feel is much more excruciating than if you had not used any numbing cream.He was right and so it was, it was 5 hours of tattooing and the worst physical pain I've ever felt in my life, even crying in pain.So my advice, the product is great, for small pieces or for short sessions of up to 2 hours.DO NOT USE FOR LARGE PIECES GOING BEYOND 2 HOURS, it's hell on earth.

An excellent upgrade!
Reviewed in Canada on April 16, 2015Style: IS II ZoomVerified Purchase
I have used a Canon T3 for many years. A local store had an offer for an upgrade and I jumped at the opportunity. Below is my review for the Canon T3 which I had posted elsewhere on Amazon:Was debating between a T3i and this T3. The T3 is excellent for an amateur photographer just learning to use a DSLR. I find it fast enough for my needs (occasional action shooting) but mostly use it to take pics of nature scenes and of stars (lots of time lapse photography). It would have been nice to have the higher resolution LCD panel from the T3i, but this is pretty much the only function I miss. I use the viewfinder to actually take the shot, so only miss it while reviewing photos. The non-swivel display isn't that big of a deal, and 12MP is more than enough unless you plan on having huge prints. If you plan on getting a really fast lens with a large aperture (f2 range) you may want to consider the T3i as it has a better focusing ability for these fast lenses. Overall, very pleased with the camera and would recommend.Now why did I upgrade? The T3 sensor accumulated dust on the sensor multiple times. I do lots of lens changes and travel quite a bit so this was expected. Canon charges $100 for sensor cleaning or you can purchase the kit and do it yourself. I did the latter option but was finding I was doing this almost after every trip. The T3i's autocleaning sensor was huge for me!Over the years, I have missed the articulating screen on some shots when I need to raise the camera or shoot from low angles, doesn't happen much, but having it is nice. The higher resolution LCD screen is also much easier to see in direct sunlight.Points from my previous review that I still agree with are that the 18MP sensor is not really that necessary for me and I don't shoot high speed as often so the increase in focusing speed isn't that noticed (more on this later)Downsides: It's heavier than the T3 by quite a bit but the build quality seems better. Boot up time is almost 2X as much (due to sensor cleaning and not sure why else). Battery life isn't as good (1/3 less the T3).I have upgraded the stock lenses to STM lenses. I use polarizing filters and didn't enjoy the rotating anterior portion of the IS II series. Also the STM lenses focus quietly and quickly and full time manual override which is nice. You can read my reviews of the lenses I own at their respective pages. I have the 10-18 STM, 18 - 55 STM, and the 55 - 250 STM.Now for the important question, do I recommend? In short yes, which is why I upgraded. However, I don't just buy stuff because it has more features; think about whether or not you need the additional functionality. I loved the T3 and it served as a brilliant camera for many years and proved to be rugged enough to handle quite a bit. For instance, the T5i has a touch screen and cross-point focusing for videos and comes with the STM lens out of the box. Personally, I dislike the touch screen, don't shoot video much, and already had an STM lens.For beginners, get a T3 or T5 and save the extra cash to buy better glass (lens). This is a wonderful camera however and I doubt I'll get another unless it's full frame or I break mine somehow.Thanks for reading.

terrific Value in this camera
Reviewed in Canada on May 1, 2014Style: IS II ZoomVerified Purchase
I am an 'older'  and retired professional photographer. The Canon T3i is an earlier model (2011) of their series, thus the reduced prices. Consumers Reports gave glowing review - beating out another Canon valued over $1,000.00. My first DSL - so there is a major learning curve here, more to do with simply experimenting often to get used to the possibilities. Purchased the 55 - 250mm IS lens with this camera, tried it once and was extremely pleased with ease of operation and clarity of image. On one occasion the auto focus lens had trouble getting the job done - too many cat tails in the way. A simple flick of a switch on side of lens so I could manual focus and the shot was accomplished before subject flew off. Very pleased. All in all, terrific value and FAR more camera than I will probably use, but will have a great time learning.

blowmedowner - new Canaon T3i
Reviewed in Canada on June 21, 2012Style: IS II ZoomVerified Purchase
I have now been using my Canon T3i for about a month and have been totally satisfied with it.  I have also been able to use the two Canon lenses I already owned.  I have been particularly pleased with the ease of using the live screen viewfinder which is so helpful for close-ups with any accessories and can be adjusted to any angle, or kept closed when only the eye-level vf is required.  I also purchased the MeiKe battery grip for $49, a fraction of the cost of Canon's own model, but works just as well as the BG I have for my T1 for which I paid 5 times as much for Canon's own version.Delivery was within the specified time, but on receiving the package I was alarmed to find that the bottom of the (used) box was almost falling off.  However, fortunately, on opening the package the inner container, the camera's own box, was in perfect condition, and so was the camera itself.  I would recommend that a better quality outside box be used on future shipments of that value.  Aside from this potential problem, I can happily endorse the reliability and ease of doing business with Amazon.

Reviewed in Canada on April 29, 2023Style: IS II ZoomVerified Purchase
EDIT: The battery and camera works after some finangling and positioning. Its a bit odd, lke a replacement battery or aftermarket battery comes with it. When I put the battery in I have to jiggle the whole camera to get it out. It's a little funny to watch someone do it to be honest. I haven't tried any of fancy techy stuff yet like livestreaming or video feed to a pc just yet, as I am still piecing together project concepts, however I will be testing out photos and video while I am out in the next week between work hours if my mental / physical strength allows me.  The camera seems to only show the ""eye-see"" hole a on at first, so you have to press the screen button, where as with an EOS 3, the menus for aperture and such are defaulted onto the viewing screen. Though, it is an older model for streaming capabilities for my art, so it's to be expected. Another update perhaps after I get some actual photos. :)--Initial Review:The camera itself looks ok, however I haven't been able to turn it on yet due to the battery that came with it having difficulties charging / turning on the device. If I get it working within the week or less I'll upload some photos.

The Canon T3i is the best entry level DSLR I know for video from my own experience and preference, but I was having trouble finding it since it's basically discontinued. Didn't feel like spending what might be $900 for the T5i, which doesn't have any new features that would be of use to me, so I'm pleased I was able to find a seller on here. Camera works as expected, have had it since November with no issue. The only thing is that the kit lens is pretty crappy, but if you're seriously getting into videography/photography then you'll already know that this is a great camera body and all you need to do is invest in top lenses. Happy shopping, fellow media hounds! ;)

A nice compromise from buying/ building expensive rigs.
Reviewed in Canada on November 10, 2016Verified Purchase
Last year I built an i7-6700K, 980TI SLI custom case PC so that I could play Dark Souls 3, ESO and DCUO in 4K. Mostly I play ESO now, and I've swapped to PS4 simply on account of a wider community (at the hours I play) and lack of bots/cheating. So this massive investment was just sitting on my desk and the television that I'd purchased to showcase it was being used as a giant monitor for Word...I mean, ergonomically, it was a functional and quite useful, though practically a waste.When Sony announced that their new PS4 was intended to keep people who were interested in jumping to PC mid-cycle hooked into their ecosystem, I thought they were absolutely mad. But I've played it now, and the hardware is incredibly capable. Does it compare to my rig? No. But in what world would a $500 box compare to a $5000 one? Even with that caveat, the Pro comes irritatingly, passably close. And that's enough for me. If every three years I can pick up a new box with all the benefits of console ownership and all the titles that I love on PC, I don't think I'll ever go through the expense or hassle of building a rig again.Some pros and cons:-Easy setup and transfer of data from one PS4 to the Pro. That said: HAVE TWO LONG NETWORK CABLES ready and available for this process. I guess I'm lucky that I'm a recovering PCaholic, and I have plenty of wires and crap around, but not everyone does. You can do a transfer of data via the old external HDD copy/ recopy, but it takes forever and I wouldn't recommend it.-Make sure you have an HDR ready set. Fully RGB and chroma. Alot of televisions still don't have the proper spec, and you won't get the ""wow"" factor of HDR in games that support it without the right equipment. Samsung's newest (and late last year's models) and Sony are usually a safe bet.-Be aware that you can only have one ""master"" PS4, which will probably be the Pro. Read up on account privileges and sharing.-All new titles moving forward have Pro support, only twenty or thirty (and growing) older titles do. Any title that does have Pro support will play just like a regular PS4 game on a standard PS4. The upscale on unpathced titles is decent, though (not to be confused with actual Pro-software bells, whistles and enhanced resolutions).-The power cord is FAT, like launch PS3 fat. I had to cut a wider hole in the back of my entertainment cabinet before I could set up the device.I think those are my thoughts after several hours of owndership. All in all, above my expectations. Price, performance and ease of use are bang-on. If it explodes in the next six months or becomes sentient and starts a man-on-cyborg war, I'll update my review to you know.

Amazing Machine. Just got it today. It said same day shipping but I got it a week later. No problem, Canada Post sucks. However, this machine is great. Playing in 4K is great. You can actually notice the games loading faster than on a regular PS4.If you don't have a 4K TV, this may not be worth it. Just put an SSD in your regular PS4 and you'll be fine. This is only worth it for 4K and the little extra speed. Again, I haven't noticed in game speed increases so far. I've only noticed loading time decreases. That being said, if I play a CPU and Graphics intensive game, perhaps I'll notice less lag than with the regular PS4.It's totally worth it though. $521.99 over a ""3 year"" period isn't bad at all.Edit: Credit-Card issue for PSN Store has been solved. Sony has fixed the bug. For anyone wondering, I previously rated the product 1 star because I was NOT able to purchase any games at all even with the same Credit-Card I purchased this PS4 with. I contacted Sony and they said it was my problem. I had a bank teller that owns a PS4 also tell me that the information I entered was 100% correct (Everything ALL-CAPS and exactly like on a bank-statement). Sony verified again, saw that my account was locked for no reason, fixed the issue and even threw in a game for free (PS4 OS 4.06 apparently fixes the issue - Before that, my PS4 was unusable even through PSN-Cards).This product, the support, the games, the graphics, the speed. It's 100% worth it.

As soon as I opened the box I can smell it, it’s smells sweet and clean I loved it and it smells like lavender with lemon with a hint of some type plant lol it’s definitely a summer smell. He says it’s his favourite cologne at the moment and all his friends loved it. The bottle feels very expensive and the box was nice, the bottle cap feels heavy and expensive.

A great buy for the price, and well worth it after it's been out for so long.
Reviewed in Canada on July 29, 2019Verified Purchase
Let's start with the positives, the console is amazing for the price and even though I was reluctant to spend money for PlayStation plus the cost want bad at all and you actually get a deal when you buy more consecutive months. The console came in good shape and hasn't let me down in any way. The game selection is amazing but the lack of a good driving game was a little disappointing. The UI is great and easy to navigate. The themes are good although I wish they were free. The exclusives a great and always garunteed quality. Even though this console came out a while ago I think it's still worth the money. Now on to the downsides. The box it came in felt a little flimsey as it was made of cardstock and not cardboard which I would have preferred as it was being shipped. The Amazon box it came in was cardboard so that kinda makes up for it. The hard drive slot cover is very thin cheap feeling plastic and feels as if it would break easily with little effort. The controllers 3.5 mm audio jack feels like it's in an odd place and I find myself bumping the cable I have plugged in the odd time although I don't know where else Sony would put it so I don't really have a good solution. Overall however, the PS4 is a great console and well worth the money. I originally bought the console as a stand in between computers as my old one recently stopped working. I intended to sell the console when I wanted to buy the new computer but having used it for about a month I've now decided I'm going to keep it. It's won over me and I think it will win over you too.

First-Gen VR is here
Reviewed in Canada on May 4, 2020Edition: Oculus Quest - 64GBVerified Purchase
You will find better quality VR gear but this one has no wires or towers - it makes room scale that much more immersive when you don't have to think about a tether. Oculus Quest feels like a VR gaming console mixed with a VR version of your Android smartphone. The dashboard is very fun and snappy to ""shoot at"" with the controllers. It's very immersive.Setup using the phone was quick and easy. I made an Oculus account and skipped linking it to Facebook because I don't use it. It also let me skip the credit card info which is good because I'm not ready to buy anything else just yet. Then the phone put the headset into update mode and it was done minutes later. The Quest came pre-loaded with quite a few demos to try which was nice. None of the games gave me motion sickness, but the joystick movement and buggy looking menu system in Rec Room eventually got to me. I had to take the headset off for a bit to settle the stomach before jumping back in.The only major con I have been experiencing is with the lenses, apparently the smudgey look in them is normal so I have accepted it as a first-gen limitation of the manufacturing process, it's not usually that noticeable but it's annoying when it is. The headset makes you see things as though they are further away so I had to use contact lenses as a near-sighted person. The headset has enough room for my small rectangle glasses as well but big round glasses don't fit. There is definitely a screen door effect but it's also not very noticeable while you are moving around gaming. Being able to watch TV in VR is very cool and useful but the visual experience is degraded because of the lenses and the screen door effect and in no way compares to regular TV quality. Making the VR TV enormous helps though and laying down and watching on the ceiling is crazy.Overall I have had a ton of fun and, despite its flaws, it feels well worth the price for entry VR. I wasn't sure if this would be a keep or a return since VR is still so early but I'm totally hooked now.

Oculus Quest is a game changer for VR.  Seriously.
Reviewed in Canada on August 22, 2019Edition: Oculus Quest - 64GBVerified Purchase
I spent a few months trying to decide whether to purchase the Oculus Rift S or the new Quest.  I was initially worried about the quality of the games, running on a mobile processor vs a full pc desktop with a powerful graphics card, but after watching reviews, and then discovering the possibility of being able to stream VR games from my gaming PC, I decided to bite the bullet and purchase the Quest.  A couple of things immediately won me over:1) No cables and 360 degree tracking.  This, in itself, is amazing and a game changer.  Once you try it, it’s really really hard to go back.2) The portability.  I travel a lot for work and I can take this thing with me anywhere.  That’s awesome.The game library is somewhat limited, but games are coming out all the time and there are quite a few great options in the store.  Beat Saber is fantastic, and there are a number of really fun and immersive games that will blow you away.If I have any complaints they would be the following:1) The unit is somewhat heavy sitting on your face.  It’s not too bad, but long sessions you may notice it.2) Battery life - I get about 2 hours right now, which is actually fine as I usually only play for about 30mins to an 1hr each evening so it’s enough for me, but may be a pain for those who like longer sessions (FYI - you can use a battery pack and mount it on the back for extra play time should you desire, there’s a couple guides on the net that explain how to do this).3) Audio.  It has these built in speakers that fire down towards your ears and, while it works quite well, you’ll probably want to get your one earphones to use instead.  A nice feature is that Oculus provide two external headphone jacks on either side of the headset, and they work great.  But it’s something to note.  Also, if you do use the built in ones, everyone will hear what you are playing.All in all I absolutely love this device and am thrilled with it.  I cannot wait to see where this technology goes, the possibilities are endless and I really believe this is the future of VR.

Great lip balm
Reviewed in Canada on February 4, 2024Verified Purchase
This has been one of my go-to lip balms for years.  They make a lip balm, but it's more expensive (gram for gram as it contains fewer grams), and I wouldn't say I like the formulation as much. I know that this may freak out some people, but it's dermatologist recommended and doesn't forget that the nipple's skin cracks just like the lips skin does.This isn't your flavourful Chapstick (that doesn't moisturize).  Some people complain about the lack of flavour, but remember that this has the bare minimum ingredients to keep it safe for breastfeeding babies. This also means it's safe for you (unless you have a lanolin allergy).

It's become an essential part of my daily skincare routine, and for good reason.First and foremost, the SPF 30 protection gives me peace of mind knowing that my skin is shielded from harmful UV rays, helping to prevent sun damage and premature aging. The addition of hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and ceramides provides hydration and nourishment, leaving my skin feeling soft, smooth, and healthy.As someone with normal to dry skin, I appreciate that this moisturizer is oil-free, so it doesn't leave behind a greasy residue or clog my pores. The formula is lightweight and absorbs quickly, making it perfect for wearing under makeup or on its own.The travel-size packaging is convenient for on-the-go use, whether I'm running errands around town or jetting off on a vacation. Plus, the verified extended use date gives me confidence that the product will remain effective over time.Overall, I highly recommend the CeraVe Facial Moisturizer with SPF 30 to anyone looking for reliable sun protection combined with hydration and nourishment for their skin. It's a must-have in my skincare arsenal, and I wouldn't be without it.

Superb moisturizer!

The inclusion of SPF 30 in this facial moisturizer is a game-changer for daily sun protection. It offers a broad-spectrum shield against harmful UVA and UVB rays, providing peace of mind whether I'm indoors or outdoors. The lightweight formula ensures comfortable wear without the heaviness often associated with high SPF products.Hydration is key, and EraVe has struck the perfect balance with this moisturizer. The lotion is rich enough to keep my skin feeling supple and moisturized throughout the day, yet it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. This makes it an ideal base for makeup application or for those who prefer a non-greasy finish.The fragrance-free formula is a standout feature, especially for those with sensitive skin. It's gentle and non-irritating, making it suitable for daily use without concerns about fragrance-related sensitivities. This thoughtful consideration for sensitive skin sets EraVe apart in the world of facial moisturizers with SPF.

I started with trying the CeraVie cream as recommended by my dermatologist for the body and I liked it more than any other cream I’ve ever tried! It was very nourishing and hydrating without being any greasiness in any way. So I then went on to trying the face and eye creams. Rave reviews for both of these as well! Such a wonderful line of products. Simple, reasonably priced and effective. What more could you ask for! Next I will be trying the face wash.

The box closes tightly, the clasp is secure and does not wiggle around.  The interior lining has a nice smooth finish with a lip the sets nicely into the lid.The sleeves for the key fobs are nice and light with an attached clip for attaching to a key ring, purse etc.All pieces are a good quality.The sleeves are very effective at blocking the fob signal to the vehicle from outside and inside the vehicle. I was unable to start the vehicle and repeatedly received the no key detected message on dash.  The fob fits very easily inside with room to spare.The box also provided the same results when the fob was inside the sealed box in the vehicle.  It does exactly what it is supposed to it blocks the signal and provides peace of mind in knowing it can keep the vehicle from easy theft.

It’s great but…
Reviewed in Canada on October 5, 2022Verified Purchase
It’s a really great streaming device but I have a few reasons it doesn’t get 5 stars.Firstly, the menu is really laggy. It’s odd for a brand new device to be choppy and take a few seconds to load the Home Screen. So I wasn’t too impressed with that.Next, it has ads. I am really dissatisfied with this. They are few and far between, but I paid in full for my fire stick and I pay my subs. I shouldn’t be getting ads for McDonald’s on my Home Screen. Even if it is just a quick picture on the top, or a quick screen when the screen saver comes up. It’s gross. I hate this ads on everything culture we’re getting pushed into. If it’s not something I can watch or potentially sub to, it shouldn’t be on my fire stick.Thirdly, the Alexa for searching kinda sucks. I was trying to teach my kids to use it to find their shows, but for example, I’ll say search for “Daniel Tiger” and it will bring it up but only the season our subs don’t cover. It’s not even the most recent season, or the first one. So my kids can’t just select and go, I have to manually go in and switch seasons, choose episodes, etc. Same with things like TOTS the kids show on Disney plus. If you say play tots or search tots it doesn’t even bring that up. You have to say the full title “Tiny one’s delivery service” which is a pain in the butt. So we don’t even use Alexa anymore. It takes less time to type what you’re searching in. I thought Alexa was supposed to be a little smarter lol.I wish that the home screen was a little more customizable. Like I almost wish you could just have a screen with your selected apps, instead of having to load all the little pictures of the things I’m not gonna watch.As for the good things, I also have a lot to say! We got it initially to stream discovery plus, as our ps4 didn’t have the app to run it. It runs phenomenally! We don’t get any lag, no “potato vision,” and it rarely buffers. We have the thing hardwired to the modem, which helps. It is so nice to have one convenient remote to access all our services. It can turn the tv on and off and change the volume as well which is awesome. It has live tv (stack tv) for us which is awesome in addition to all the big services. I love the integration of Amazon photos so you can have your own photos as a screen saver, which can be conveniently uploaded from your phone! It really has all we need as a family and we’re overall satisfied!

The Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote has completely transformed my entertainment setup, providing a seamless streaming experience with added convenience and control.First and foremost, the setup process was a breeze. Within minutes, I had the Fire TV Stick plugged into my TV and connected to my Wi-Fi network. The intuitive on-screen instructions guided me through the setup, and I was ready to start streaming in no time.The HD streaming quality is outstanding, delivering crisp and clear visuals for all of my favorite shows, movies, and apps. Whether I'm watching Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, or YouTube, the Fire TV Stick ensures a smooth and immersive viewing experience without any buffering or lag.The real star of the show, however, is the Alexa Voice Remote. The addition of TV controls allows me to power on my TV, adjust the volume, and mute or unmute with simple voice commands. It's incredibly convenient, especially when I can't find the remote or when I'm too lazy to reach for it.I also appreciate the built-in Alexa functionality, which allows me to search for content, control playback, and even check the weather or set reminders using just my voice. The voice recognition is impressively accurate, understanding natural language commands with ease.Furthermore, the compact size of the Fire TV Stick makes it ideal for travel or use in multiple rooms. I can easily take it with me on vacation or move it between TVs without any hassle. The included HDMI extender ensures a secure fit, even in tight spaces behind the TV.Overall, I highly recommend the Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote to anyone looking to upgrade their streaming experience. With its HD streaming capabilities, enhanced Alexa Voice Remote, and compact design, it's a must-have addition to any entertainment setup. Trust me; you won't be disappointed!

High quality standards conversion for VCR
Reviewed in Canada on January 4, 2022Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I had bought an old VCR to convert digitize videotapes, some of which were in the European PAL format. Unfortunately, the VCR came from the Ukraine, and would only play the tapes back in its own native standard, SECAM. After many attempts to change the VCR settings, I bought this little box. After a taking a couple of seconds to lock onto the picture, it had no difficulty digitizing the SECAM signal, and the video quality it outputs is really excellent. That really impressed me.It will work with normal North American devices too, and the quality is just as good. You can display the picture directly by running an HDMI cable (not included!) into a TV. I wanted to copy the video, so I ran an HDMI cable into a ""game capture"" device, then into a computer, using OBS software to resize the picture and record it.I've been very pleased with the results. The box converts both video and sound. Audio is correctly synchronized to the video. There are no obvious digital artifacts, and the output image is very stable – I suspect the conversion process stabilizes a jumpy picture.If you're playing back from a standard video source, the image will always be stretched to widescreen. Viewing a video image in its normal 4:3 aspect ratio requires adjusting the picture settings on the TV.  I think it manipulates the colour, too – the images seemed more vivid than you might expect from an old tape. (Eg, blacks are black rather than grey. It looks good.) A switch provides two widescreen HD resolutions – 720P and 1280P. The lower one is more than enough for videotapes.You get only the converter box and its USB power cord. You need to buy suitable cables, as well as a USB power supply. The converter uses a USB cable as its power cord – which is likely to confuse a few customers. A clumsy arrangement.However, for the low price, this is an amazing little device. I also own the Elgato Video Capture Card, which is easier to use and set up, and includes friendly software, but can't do the conversion tricks that this converter can do. If you don't mind tinkering to get it set up, this converter is outstanding value.

Don't use composite cables for older TVs or video game consoles and instead find out if component cables can be used instead as they are much higher quality, regardless this adapter works amazingly and was pretty easy to use, the 720p/1080p function doesn't work though but you're using composite cables so what did you expect.

I picked up the SanDisk Extreme microSDXC memory card a few months ago, motivated by its excellent reputation for reliability and performance. My expectations were high: a card capable of handling large files quickly, ideal for cameras, drones or smartphones.Using this card was a real pleasure. Its high transfer speed allowed me to move and access my files quickly, which is crucial when you don't want to waste a moment. However, I noted that in extreme conditions its performance may fluctuate slightly.In terms of quality, the SanDisk Extreme does not disappoint. It resists shock, water and extreme temperatures, making it a perfect choice for adventurers. Its performance is up to par, with competitive read and write speeds.Highlights: high speed, durable, large storage capacity.Cons: Slightly inconsistent performance in extreme conditions, somewhat high price.Compared to other microSD cards on the market, the SanDisk Extreme stands out for its speed and reliability. However, for those looking for a more economical option, brands like Kingston or Samsung offer interesting alternatives.To maintain its performance, I recommend formatting the card regularly and storing it in a dry place at room temperature.Technical details- Capacity: up to 1 TB.- Reading speed: up to 160 MB/s.- Resistance to the elements: waterproof, shock and temperature resistant.For optimal performance, use this card with devices that support UHS-I. It is ideal for recording and playing 4K videos.The SanDisk Extreme microSDXC memory card is an excellent choice for those looking for speed and reliability. It represents a safe investment for enthusiasts of photography, videography or simply to increase the storage of their smartphone.

I use this memory card for a dash camera.. After about 1 year I have many experiences of these cards faulting out and needing to be reformatted to the dash cam or just not able to record anymore. Could be the heavy use of constant video recording and perhaps some influence from the heat of the sun coming through the window. This was a decent price to purchase so I have used this brand over others. I would change it out yearly if you really want to rely on it being useful when you need it the most.

Reviewed in Canada on September 12, 2023Verified Purchase
This worked great for me. Using it once to twice a day the batteries given with it lasted a year and a half. I still need to sniff the water down my throat to clear my nose properly, but this works out better and cheaper than buying the canisters of salt water. It's gentle on my nose as well, far more gentle than those metal canisters with salt water (which are also over $10 CAD each).It takes a time or two to get used to using it, but it didn't take me long. I use about one third of the water at a time, then just leave it to use it next time, without opening it. This means I only go through a salt pod every other day. It's a little hard to clean because you aren't supposed to get the bottom wet. There is rubber around the battery pack, but they still don't want you to get the bottom wet, just in case.I find this useful and mine has worked great for the past two years, and it's still works great (I just changed the batteries).

Amazing Noise Cancellation & Great out of the box sound.
Reviewed in Canada on February 24, 2022Colour Name: Midnight BlueStyle: WH1000XM4Verified Purchase
Sound Quality (5/5)These are the first headphones I've owned that when first listening to them I didn't immediately flinch and look for the nearest EQ. I'm no sound engineer, but definitely it has great bass and great quality for mids & highs.Noise cancelation (5/5)Although this is my first set of headphones that support this feature. I'm really blown away by it. I have an air purifier in my office, and even at medium setting. The fan is pretty noisy. But with these things on, I can barely hear it, and that's with no music/movie playing. But as soon as I turn on a movie or song, I seriously can't tell it's on.I read some people say they could hear a waterfall or something in the background. I can't hear anything other than silence, or what I'm listening to.Wireless/Wired (4/5)Being able to use the headphones with them powereoff with a wire, or have them connect wireless via bluetooth is an amazing feature. And it works really well!I was really surprised  however that I don't seem to be able to use this headset with the bluetooth of my main PC. It has a really think glass panel, so I'm wondering if it's not because of that. If you own a case with a glass panel, maybe double check with another set of bluetooth headse/earbuds to see how the conenction goes.Audio Delay/lag on Bluetooth (5/5)I own a mini laptop and it only has bluetooth 4.1. But for some reason when I watch videos or movies, I'm  virtually unable to tell whether there is lag. Unlike any other bluetooth earbuds I've owned. The delay is amazing. Obviously your mileage may vary, but it's something that drove me insane with my previous wireless earbuds. Don't have this problem here!Gestures (4/5)I wasn't really looking forward to the gestures pad. But it turns out to be working really well. Once in a while an action won't register. But it's really rare for me.Play/Pause on a PC can be a little weird though. One day I was listening to spotify while working, and then with the tab still opened I started watching youtube after work. And after pausing said video and unpausing it, using the headset. It ended up starting the playback of both my spotify tab, and my youtube tab.Comfort (4/5)First day I wore them I was a little concerned since, even though I have a small head. I felt like the headphones were pretty tight on my head. But after even just 2 days of use. It's already leagues better. Either I got used to it, or it's 'breaking in'.The cups are pretty comfortable. Wish they would be just a tad larger, not sure if I have big ears. But I can tell that part of my right ear touches the pad. And I'm wondering if I ever end up pulling a really long work, or gaming session if it'll end making my ear feel pinched. One of my older headsets did that.One thing that I was happily surprised was the weight of the headset. With such an impressive battery life and suite of features. I was expecting this thing to be rather heavy. Compared to a Corsair Void (probably a bad example) it's light as a feather.Pairing Headphones with 2 Devices (3/5)First thing, this feature is only possible via the headphone's native app. Meaning you can't perform this type of sync with the physical sync button. Once you have the devices regisered on the app, then you can enable a setting and select which 2 devices you want.On the topic of ""2 devices"", I guess Is should have read more on this feature. But I use 2 PCs at home, a media and a work/gaming PC. And I really would have liked to be able to on the fly, switch between audio of both. But it turns out that you can only connect to 1 phone, and something else. It can be 2 phones, but not 2 PCs.Included Accessories (3/5)The case it comes with is great. Hard-shell clam design, with some neat nook where you can shove the USB C charging cable, audio cable and airplane adapter thing. But as much as I like the quality and how it snuggly holds on to and protects the headphones. Not sure if mine is a fluike, but whoever decided to sew the elastic mesh bag on the 'bottom' part of the clam. Kind of silly.The audio cable is 'OK' if you use it for your phone. But if you want to use it for a PC you'll for sure either need an extension or a longer cable period. But at least it's a usesable lenght albeit a little conservative.But the USB type c charging cable. I hope you have a USB hub available. Depending on the case/setup you have. I'm pretty sure a lot of people wouldn't be able to use that cable to connect the headphones to their PC's back USB ports. Well you could do it, but depending on your case or setup. The headphones won't be able to rest on either the top of your case, or the desk/floor it's own. They'll end up dangling. (Which I think would be a bad idea.)

Super comfortable, top music quality
Reviewed in Canada on October 23, 2020Colour Name: BlackStyle: WH1000XM4Verified Purchase
I have a pair of Bose wired QC-35 so this is my base for comparison. I bought these because I was tired of having the cable in my way all the time.Context: I use the XM-4 mostly with my laptop but they're also paired with my Galaxy S10. The only noises I have in my environment are my wife sitting about a meter away from me in our home office and she speaks very loudly when she is in a virtual meeting (and she has quite a lot of them and the keyboard clicks. So, noise cancelling is mostly used for surrounding voice.Let's start with noise cancelling: The Sony XM4 have about the same noise cancellation quality as the wired QC-35 but the XM4 have a white noise that is a bit bugging me when I'm not listening to anything, just using them for noise cancellation while the QC-35 do not have a white noise and can cancel noise as well as the XM4. I mostly use noise cancellation because my wife is sitting about one meter away and she very often takes phone meeting and she speaks quite loudly. The XM4 and the QC-35 cancel about 60% of her voice so when I listen to music, even at low volume I don't hear her at all.Sound: The sound is a bit better than the wired QC-35. The bass is deep and all the frequencies are crisp and clear. I can hear every single instruments very clearly so I can enjoy my music better than ever before. These headphones should definitely be able to satisfy the most demanding audiophiles out there. Also they can play loud enough to damage your ear drums which is pretty good for wireless headphones. The sound is as good whether it comes from my laptop or my Galaxy S10 phone.Calls using my Galaxy S10: If I receive a call on my Galaxy S10 while listening to music on my laptop (or my phone), the XM4 will pause the music and ring in the headphones. A simple double tap on the touch sensor and I can answer the call or reject it by holding a finger on the touch sensor. The quality of the audio during calls is excellent; I can hear very well and I'm told that the sound on the other side of the conversation is very good. I never tried them in a noisy environment or outside when the wind is blowing but Sony states that the XM4 will cancel most of the ambiant noise to keep the other side of the call clean.Features: I love the many features the XM4 offer. Here are a few features I particularly like: 1. When listening to music, I just have to take the headphones off and the XM4 will automatically pause the music thanks to the proximity sensor inside the left can. I simply have to put them back on for the music to start again. 2. When I listen to music and I want to talk to someone, I don't have to take them off, I just have to start talking and the music will automatically pause and the mics on the unit will make sure I can hear what's being said so I can carry a conversation without taking them off. Then, 15 or 30 seconds (configurable) after I stop talking, the music starts again. 3. Finally, the multiple commands I can use on the touch sensor such as volume up/down, next/previous song, fast-forward/backward and more. Another feature that is nice for those who want to use it is the integration with Alexa or Google assistant. However since I do not use any assistant, I cannot comment on this.Comfort: I have regular size ears so the cups surround them completely and do not put pressure on any part of my ears. I was able to wear them for 9 hours straight (while wearing glasses) with one short break in the middle for lunch and I felt no discomfort. Comparatively, the QC-35 have about the same size cup but the leather on the QC-35 is more comfortable than on the XM4.App: The Sony ""Headphone"" app is pretty good and complete, helping you customize your headphone sound and behavior very easily. You can configure an equalizer to adjust the sound to your specific preferences, customize the function of the second button on the left ear piece, turn on/off different feature of the XM4, update the firmware, and more. If your willing to give the app GPS location permission, you can have different configuration depending on where you are, home, office, commute, etc. This is a big one for me, I'm not forced to give GPS location permission to the app, contrary to the Bose Bluetooth headphone app. With Bose, if you don't give GPS location permission, you can't even pair your headphones! I won't comment on the location feature of the XM4 since I'm not using it but I'm happy I'm not forced to give this permission.Cons: I had to think hard to find any cons but here they are. 1. I cannot use the headphones while charging but this is minor since the battery life is so long and you can use them with the supplied 3.5mm cord but without the mic function. 2. The cushions on the QC-35 are more comfortable, softer than the ones on the XM4. I've read a lot of reviews mentioning problems with TV sound so I tested my MX4 with my Samsung Smart TV; the pairing was easy enough but the sound was constantly choppy so I would not recommend them if you want to watch TV with them.Summary: As far as I know, as of now these are the best wireless headphones on the planet! Great sound, feature rich and very comfortable but not recommended for TV watching.

Same as the Vet!
Reviewed in Canada on May 25, 2023Verified Purchase
Advantage products (Advantage II) are my go-to flea treatments for both of my dogs.  When it comes tick season early to mid spring, I purchase the Advantix treatments.  They come in a bit cheaper on Amazon compared to what I used to pay at the vet and it is the exact same treatments for a lower cost.They are easy to use, you just take the cap off of the product, turn the cape upside down and place it onto the tip of the tube and twist, which breaks the seal and you're good to go!  Spread your dogs fur until you can see some skin and squeeze a little of the product directly to the skin.  I usually do this in about 4-5 spots along my dog's back until the tub is empty.I have been using this product for years and I can say with 100% certainty that it DOES work when it comes to fleas and ticks.  I live in the the Country in Nova Scotia and we have a large infestation of ticks every spring.  Once April hit, I was pulling 1-3 ticks off each of my dogs daily.  I am not into each dogs' second treatment and I haven't found a single tick since.Very strongly recommend not just Advantix but all Advantage products.  You will not be disappointed.Take note that I have heard from others that some dogs MAY take allergic reactions to these products, so always try a test site first before applying the full product.

9/10 streaming experience
Reviewed in Canada on March 27, 2024Verified Purchase
I've been playing the latest game: Rise of the Ronin extensively on this device. PS5 connected to 1Gbps wired ethernet. PSP connected to the same WiFi network. Hardly any setup required. Plug and play. So far so good. I'm mostly happy with the experience. For an action intensive game (action timing is paramount) this device holds up well. I hardly feel the input lag. Everything is quite smooth. Picture is crisp and clear. Not bad for an LCD screen. I think the battery life is also good. You can also play it plugged in--the wire doesn't affect holding the device at all. Ergonomics is good as well. There is occasional hiccup when things get choppy and laggy, but I think it's mostly due to wifi being unstable.I have yet to try it on any other games. I would recommend it if you need a streaming device for playing PS5 games. This thing does its job. Straightforward and simple.

Better than you think, as long as you know what you're getting into.
Reviewed in Canada on November 18, 2023Verified Purchase
I was pleasantly surprised the device worked a lot better than I originally thought. As long as you set your expectations, and know what you are getting into, the handheld works quite well.It is also using Android 13 (Tiramisu), and there will be an update or 2 out of the box.You will need a very strong and stable internet connection with high bandwidth (preferably a mesh wifi system) and/or at least mobile 4G/LTE (preferably 5G) for the Portal to work properly without any interruptions or disconnections and/or streaming artifacting.The input latency/lag is still there, but I felt it was noticeably lower than playing Remote Play on an iPad or phone connected with a DS5 via bluetooth (and way noticeably lower than playing PS4 remotely on a Vita).Because the controller is physically a part of the screen/device, there is less lag/latency when playing. However, competitive and quick twitchy/reflex based games should be avoided, unless you are just playing for fun.Overall, the portal being an Android device that comes with an 8"" crisp lcd display, the $269 CDN price tag is not as bad as I originally thought. Also imagine the possibilities when this thing can get jailbroken.I will, definitely, NOT be returning mine. Good luck finding yours, as it is supposedly sold out everywhere. But do NOT pay the scalper's price, it is worth the wait until Sony releases more units.

Underrated and underestimated
Reviewed in Canada on December 5, 2023Verified Purchase
This little console is good for what it does.It is like having your PS5 in the palms of your hands regardless of where you are.Provided that you have good internet.I have great internet and I’m a dad so this is the ideal buy for me as I’m not always in front of my tv depending on what’s going on in my life.Screen is pristine, lag is manageable. There are times when it can drop bad but most of the time it’s not bad enough to complain.If this console gets the ability to stream PS Plus premium games then that will also be huge.Do your research and see if it’s right for you.I personally love it for my use case but my use case will not be the same as everyone else’s.It’s not worth more than retail however.Watch out for scalpers.Cheers.

Constant stutter

This device has one purpose, to stream from PS5. It does it poorly, with a constant stutter every 8-10 seconds. The ergonomics are great and the display is sharp and well calibrated. The display has very poor contrast though. The stutter is a deal breaker. Remote play on my PC and steam deck is buttery smooth; not on this device.

the performance and missing features made me return it
Reviewed in Canada on January 4, 2024Verified Purchase
i really wanted to like this device but it was just too restricted and poor-performing. performance was far worse than remote play on my phone, a 2-year-old google pixel 6.i understand the lack of bluetooth connectivity, it eats up bandwidth. but it's still missing. of course you can use PS LINK enabled devices but my sony xm4s should work with sony products. anyway, i digress. yes, there's a headphone jack awkwardly placed on the rear. i had to try a few audio cables before i found one that fit at the angle of the port.i have 25mbps internet at home and even with the console wired to my router it wasn't enough. with the console on wifi it was almost unusable. perhaps with less demanding games it would have been fine but i would have expected it to be enough for at least the majority of games i tested and i was wrong. i tested god of war ragnarok, the lords of the fallen, GT7, robocop rogue city, aliens fireteam elite and RE4 (no multiplayer tests, only single player) and all stuttered far too much. meanwhile, my phone played everything smoothly and flawlessly connected to the same wifi.the device is comfortable and lighter than i expected it to be. setup was easy too. the built-in speakers are quite poor, i didn't like them.for the price tag of $300 after taxes i had to return it, it was too disappointing to keep. i'm going to hold out for a newer version hopefully with more features and better performance.

4 pairs of sandals &1 pair of boots
Reviewed in Canada on August 5, 2023Verified Purchase
This little bottle of glue is worth every penny. I've used it to repair 3 pairs of expensive flip flops, 1 pair of ladies Chaco Sandals and one pair of Timberland boots. You use only a tiny line of this glue, so even though the bottle is small, you will be able to repair many pairs of shoes, boots and sandals. Don't get any on your skin, and if you do, drop everything and get it off right away.  I accidedently got a little residue on a metal clamp (holding the sole and flip flop together while drying) and it was no small task prying and tearing to get that clamp off. This is stronger than any Crazy Glue or Gorilla Glue I've ever used. Excellent product that does what it says it will do. If I ever run our, I wouldabsolutely buy this repair glue again!

Reviewed in Canada on December 13, 2019Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
Prompt arrival and neatly packaged. The game itself is super fun and simple to grasp for children playing as well. Mario and Luigi are going through the levels to make it to the final castle. They give you many bonus rounds to earn tons of mushrooms and etc. to assist you through other levels. There is a secret star level after the final battle with Bowser. I recommend this game as it really is a lot of fun to play especially with others!

Reviewed in Canada on April 19, 2020Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
What I love most about this game is that 4 can play at the same time.  Which is hilarious.  It can be a bit frustrating too at times as easy to get in each other's way, but that can also lead to lots of laughs.The only reason that I knock off a star is because I find the play level too challenging.  We've been stuck in World 2 for pretty much the entire time since we got the game at Christmas - just never able to quite win enough before getting the cursed GAME OVER! message.

Reviewed in Canada on July 26, 2020Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Got the boyfriend this toy to try. He says he has tried another, cheaper version of a masturbator cup like this in the past and this one knocks that one out of the park! The material is very soft and feels highly quality. It has a valve that helps with the suction but also doubles to help with cleaning. Cleaning is easy enough but obviously not quite as simple as other toys that are for insertion. The base is sturdy and strong, but feels a little big even for his fairly large hands. He says it feels really good and he likes it but I think he would like it more if it vibrated too so that's what we have our sights on for his next try. Overall, he enjoys this a lot so well done!

The fan will dry it throughout for next useThe lube from the same brand is also the best to use with it omg such a difference.  I bought the “Amazon recommended” lube and it dries out way quick and you need too much.The lube is important !  Find the right one too!

My favourite handheld system
Reviewed in Canada on March 7, 2020Colour Name: YellowStyle: ConsoleVerified Purchase
I really like the Switch Lite. I bought the yellow edition because I bought Lets Go Pikachu with it.  The system has a very bright and colourful screen.  I like using the DPAD to move around in games because it reminds me of the Super Nintendo.  I have heard people say that the analog sticks can have problems but I have not found any. I decided to buy this as Nintendo offers a 12-month warranty on the system. If the analog stick does have a problem in a few months, I can get it repaired for free.It is a very light system and easy to hold and use.  I bought a memory card for it but it comes with 32GB built in.  Nintendo offers a yearly subscription service that includes cloud saving for your games and a library of free SNES and NES games to play.  The subscription has a free trial right now and is not required to play games unless you want to play them online. Most of the games I have played are single-player and made to be portable, so I have not needed to play online so far.The only downside is that the Nintendo game cartridges are expensive to purchase, but there are some deals on Amazon and I was also able to rent some games from a local video store.  The upside is that the cartridges work great and can't get scratched like a CD so they last a lot longer.I thought about buying a regular Switch system but those sell for $400 plus tax and this unit was $259 plus tax, and I like to play my games in handheld mode.  My television has been acting up lately so this way I can play console quality games on my handheld and don't need a television.

One of the best devices I've ever used.
Reviewed in Canada on January 2, 2021Colour Name: GrayStyle: ConsoleVerified Purchase
I love the Nintendo Switch Lite. It's like a super Nintendo 3DS, but sadly lacking backwards compatibility, but I understand why they left it out. Would be hard to display 2 screens on the switch screen. My issues with the switch are with nintendo. They never discount their first party games (Not that I care as I only own 2 of them haha), their accessories are stupidly overpriced, and their obvious laziness in frame rates in switch games. How is it that Super Mario Odyssey gets 60fps but Fire Emblem Three Houses gets 30 fps? I love Three Houses but frame rate is important, even in a turn based rpg. If you're like me and you don't care much for games like animal crossing, ultimate, and mario odyssey, then you'll get more bang for your buck with this thing. It kinda shocks me how many people bought a switch just for animal crossing...like what? You spent $260 canadian dollars LET ALONE $400+ for a regular switch for ANIMAL CROSSING NEW HORIZIONS? What the hell...anyway I've bought a lot of games for this thing. While I would like higher performance in most of them, I'm content with being able to play these games conveniently on the go. Sure, laptops exist and I have a good gaming laptop for on the go gaming, but a switch allows you to go into a game faster than a laptop. Not because a switch is faster than a gaming pc haha no but it starts at the games menu asap, which is nice. I give the switch a 9/10, but the value fluctuates. A lot of people have gotten ripped off by nintendo here. I haven't, since I've only bought 2 full priced games, those being Three Houses and Breath of the Wild. I'm content with spending a full $80 Canadian plus tax on these games because they've given me hundreds of hours of content, and I have yet to complete both of them. However, when it comes to animal crossing which is stardew valley but shitty framerate and not finished, no thanks. Smash ultimate looks fun but I prefer melee (better game sorry but objective).I know that I've given this thing a lot of ****, but I have lots of praise to give it too. Being able to play Resident Evil 4 on the bus is mind blowing for me. Sure, you could use a laptop but that's less convenient. Bigger machine that you need a mouse/controller for, instead of switch/switch lite where it's all in one small, convenient package. Really cool. I just hate nintendo lolScrew Sword and Shield. Overpriced garbage for hardly anything. Way too easy too never buying it.

Fantastic console with only a few cons
Reviewed in Canada on May 18, 2020Colour Name: YellowStyle: ConsoleVerified Purchase
I've been playing this non-stop since I got it. It's an easy to use console. It doesn't have a huge selection of games when you're comparing it to things like Xbox one or PS4, but I literally only got it for a handful of games I already wanted anyway lol The battery life is a tad bit disappointing, but it does charge comparatively quickly. I would highly recommend getting a protective screen and a case since if you drop this, it's likely to show it - it's not a bad design, but it is a bit delicate. Altogether, great quality and exactly as addicting as I thought it'd be. This is a great console for kids too, not just adults like me who got addicted to Nintendo decades ago lol There are games on here for every age group. The only complaint I have (and the reason it's getting 4 instead of 5 stars) if that you have to pay to play online with anyone in games like OverWatch and animal Crossing,, so expect to play solo unless you're willing to pay extra.

Don’t let faint likes discourage you
Reviewed in Canada on February 19, 2024Size: 70 count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
First the LH strips- they will always be positive, that’s normal. Medium to light colour leading up to and after ovulation. However you will notice a huge difference in the colour strip when you have your LH surge, you won’t question it because the line will be darker then the other test line and then this means you’re going to ovulate within 12-36 hours. I did the deed everyday starting on cycle day 9 until and including cycle day 16 just to be sure. My cycles are typically 28 days long, sometimes 29 and I bleed for 6 days. On day 13 I seen my LH surge and I assume I ovulated day 14/15.HCG strips- I got my first and VERY faint postive cycle day 23, the next day again, still very faint. However the day after it got a little darker. I couldn’t tell a difference in days unless I wanted two days, which makes sense as hormones double every 48-72 hours. So if you’re testing everyday don’t set discouraged thinking it’s a chemical pregnancy because the line seems too faint. Mine didn’t get darker until cycle day 27 the day before “my period”. And even then, it could be darker, it’s still only medium pink. But I took a clear blue test to be sure and this was much darker and very clearly bright positive. Today is my missed period and I’m 4 weeks pregnant first try with these strips. Please remember that even a faint positive is a positive, it will slowly get darker but you won’t be satisfied with the darkness until after your period has been missed lol.

These are great for folks going through fertility treatments where you may need multiple pregnancy tests. These are extremely sensitive and will detect hcg at 25 mIU/ml (which is a lot lower than most other companies). These are a great cost effective option that provide accurate results super early. I also can't say enough good things about the ovulation strips, they have their own app that helps you track your lh surges. It's super user friendly, I highly recommend them.

My husband and I haven't had the easiest road on our fertility journey, and multiple cycles later ovulation and pregnancy tests were getting too expensive to keep purchasing. This is a reliable, inexpensive option, and both the pregnancy and ovulations tests are just as sensitive as the well known store bought brands. There is also a great app you can download called premom which gages your ovulation tests and tells you exactly when to start trying.  The app also includes all sorts of really useful tips and personalized information and an online community of women who are all having similar struggles. I highly recommend.

You actually get a lot of strips to test for ovulation and pregnancy. Lasted a lot longer then I expected. I know some women use them almost religiously several times a day, but honestly if u just test for ovulation after ur period even a couple times a day till u find ur peak. And u only use the pregnancy tests just before period, this 1 box can last u a few months of testing.I found the ovulation testing was very accurate, as well the pregnancy strips are early detection. So if u feel the need to start testing days before ur period you'll be able to start seeing a faint line right away if ur pregnant. If ur not, you'll get no second line at all.Also with the app and the testing, the app has a feature for u to take pictures of ur testing for tracking as wellThey have an amazing app that is free with option to buy their program which can provide u with a lot of useful information if u need it. They will also have deals on this package and you can opt for a few months or longer. No adds on the app. There's even a community tab you can take to other women in same situations.I recommended just the app alone to my other friend and she was really impressed with how well it started tracking her info right away.I've bought their kit a couple times and use the app all the time! Highly recommend!

These were very cooling and soothing on a postpartum perineum. I would say the size is a little awkward for that purpose - I found I needed 3 in a row and they sometimes got kind of bunched up when trying to place them on a pad. This was not annoying enough for me to not recommend them - they still definitely did their job and were worth it! The one jar was plenty for me in my postpartum healing with some leftovers.

Incremental improvement over last, but still the best ereader for actual book reading
Reviewed in Canada on December 11, 2019Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBConnectivity: WIFIColour: GraphiteConfiguration: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase
I've had every version of the Oasis, and several previous Kindles, along with two Kobos. I dabbled with the Kobo Forma because I needed warm light -- and the last version of Oasis (before current one), sadly didn't have it. It's that important to a good reading experience. Fortunately, I came back because the Forma has uneven lighting, and the eco system just is weak. My library is hundreds of Kindle books, so I'm ""stuck."" It's  a good stuck, as I love the new Oasis 7"" with warm light. It's handy to carry, really lovely to hold with the notch and the taper (you either love it or hate it. I love it.) If I'm picky, I'd say I prefer the 7.8"" screen size of Forma, but with uneven lighting (also some noticeable flicker), it comes back to the 7"" Oasis. In real life, once you sit down with a book, 7"" is just as good, and smaller in the hand (which is great!) It's snappier too, although only a little bit, as compared to both Forma and my previous Oasis. Mainly, I love the even lighting, the auto dimming (although it's not always right on) and the must have for me -- warm lighting. I could never read with cold light for a long period of time, too fatiguing. What's the big dissapointment? Battery, if you leave Bluetooth or LTE on. Turn it off, it's days long (I read at least 3 hours a night). Turn it on, it's down in a day or two. For a real book-reader, you simply don't need it on, so turn it off, you'll be happier.You'll also be happier if you remember it's not a tablet. I have my older gen ipad for that, don't want this to be a tablet. Tablets should be tablets, readers should be readers. Tablets don't last long on batteries, and they are great with PDF documents, and so on — but book e-readers let you shut down the email, social media and other distractions and sink into a good book. I love that 32GB has enough room for thousands of books, audio books and some PDFs. It's all I need.Wish list? Next gen, make it 8"", longer battery life, even snappier on page turns if possible (each gen of e-ink seems snappier). Keep those buttons, they're lovely, but you could drop the ""click."" I don't like the sponge-like buttons on Forma, but I like their silence when reading. Nits aside, it's a spectacular device, great to haul with you anywhere, small enough for your bag, hand, to carry all day, waterproof. Don't need speakers, bluetooth or colour. Is it worth it? Yes, if you're a big reader — say 1.5 hours a day or longer, where eye fatigue and distractions are factors. No, if you're a light bathroom reader (i.e. short sessions), stick with the tablet, or the cheapest kindle.

I’m thrilled with the Oasis & I recommend it heartily!
Reviewed in Canada on April 21, 2021Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GBConnectivity: WIFIColour: GraphiteConfiguration: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase
I have extensively used a Kindle (4G), with great pleasure, since 2011.Last December (2020), I felt I wanted to try one of the newer versions with a backlight, as my eyes are ageing. I chose the Oasis, despite it being the costliest of the Amazon line of readers. I have not regretted my purchase. It did take me a few weeks to acclimate myself to the new milieu, but that’s because I’m lazy and never read the manuals…The Oasis is a superior reading device. Extremely well made, it has the look & feel of a quality instrument. The screen is large & very well lit with adjustable levels of intensity & warmth. Side buttons, as well as a touch screen, permit easy access to all the software features you could want during a reading session. I love the dictionaries & access to Wikipedia, as I read a lot of science & history.Now, after several months of use, I simply love it & use it daily for hours at a time. You can’t go wrong with the Oasis, & Amazon has the largest selection of e-books I’m aware of, in both English & French. One negative aspect, however, is that Canadian libraries have not yet signed an agreement with Amazon, so one cannot borrow their e-books with this device. That’s a shame, but maybe it will change in the future.I do also recommend getting a cover to protect this fine reader. I chose a simple one ($20) with a flip-up front that doubles as a book stand when folded back on a table or a knee. Useful & very protective for an instrument that can last for decades.

Absolutely fantastic
Reviewed in Canada on April 16, 2023Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBConnectivity: WIFIColour: GraphiteConfiguration: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase
First, I want to say thank you to Amazon for making it possible for me to get this. Instead of just replacing a defective item, they went above and beyond and got me the next generation kindle to the one I had, it wasn’t just because the one I had was out of stock. It took a bit of time to find someone who not only listened but went way above and beyond. I wouldn’t expect this every time however, it does show the value their customers. So I was beyond ecstatic to be able to try the newest kindle. It was hard to wait for it to arrive, however, absolutely worth waiting for. I would recommend this generation to absolutely anyone. I haven’t tried some of the options yet however the options I have tried are phenomenal for accessibility. I am extremely sensitive to blue light, so having that much control over the type of lighting and the brightness, while losing none of the readability, I absolutely adore. I like the fact I can turn the pages from the side, which means less fingerprints, and a more enjoyable, reading experience cause you don’t have to stop to get those fingerprints off.The screen is the perfect size not too big and not way to tiny. It’s also significantly lighter than you would expect which is fantastic. I’m always looking for something for those who love to read, but are getting up there in age and have issues reading novels in printed form. This is light enough and easy enough to navigate to be the exact item to do this with. I would recommend this for all ages. And if you can get all of your textbooks for school into your digital library. You can highlight and leave notes as well. If they have an option for swipe texting when writing things I have yet to find it. This would be the only thing I would love to see improved on with this product.I often when it’s time to upgrade, get the kits that have the item a case, cord, and charger block. I would love to see these kits include a screen protector like so many of us utilize for our phones and other portable devices to protect the screen. And if there aren’t screen protectors, I would love to see that as an option to include when you’re ordering, the item itself. For me, this is a need and an accessibility tool that I find exceedingly useful in my day to day living.So overall, I adore the product. I would recommend to absolutely anyone who can afford this generation or when they can to upgrade to this one. It is fantastic and utilizes many different tools that you find in the cell phone in regards to your screen options. The lightness is a big selling point I could probably hold. This with a broken wrist and not have it hurt. It is absolutely a product you want the keys for and you want to get a screen protector for. If you’re looking at this, I would get it in a heartbeat.

They work!
Reviewed in Canada on October 22, 2023Verified Purchase
Why did I wait so long to make the no-more-fabric-softener jump? These are fantastic!What you need to know: I looked up many different products and read many reviews, and opted for this company. And I am so glad I did! These are not the tiny wool balls like many others sell. They are substantial and of great quality. Plus you get 6 of them!For me, 3 is plenty for a full load so it’s nice to have 3 extras if ever they need replacing, but so far they show no sign of that and I’ve been using them every load for the last 6 weeks. The clothes and the towels come out super soft and without static, it truly is impressive!Now about the scent. I did miss that fresh laundry smell you get from fabric softener, It’s hard to not have that for me.  So I experimented with essential oils and opted for a mix of lavander and lemon. I put a few drops in my fabric softener dispenser for the washing and a few drops directly on the balls for the dryer. It does the trick! If you find that too expensive or don’t like the EO scents, there are also good fragrance oils you can buy with fresh linen or cotton scents or any scent you fancy. They are usually used for making soap or lotions. I’ve tried them too and they also work just fine. Just remember to use only a few drops.I feel so much better and “cleaner” for having bought this product! Money saver and most importantly, a much more ecological choice. Thank you little sheep for the soft and durable  wool you provide, I just hope you’re not hurt in this process 🤞🏻🥺🤞🏻

Great for puffing, useless for winter static
Reviewed in Canada on January 13, 2024Verified Purchase
I bought these for helping fluff my down or synthetic insulated coats when drying and they work well for that purpose, I'd give them 5 star for that. I also decided to try them out in a regular load of laundry instead of a dryer sheet and that's where I found them lacking. It's winter in Canada right now and relative humidity in my home is around 34%. Without a dryer sheet and using all 6 wool balls the amount of static electricity between my clothes was insane. It was like they were all velcroed together and I had to re-run on air fluff with a dryer sheet to get it under control. Because of the static the pet hair didn't come off in the dryer like it normally does so I had more work to do after it was dry. Maybe in a more humid environment these would work better, but as a replacement for dryer sheets (to deal with static) they were less than useless.So, for drying puffer jackets and such - 5 stars.General softness of clothes - 4 stars.Fighting static in winter - 0 stars.I'll try them again as a dryer sheet replacement in the summer months just to see if they improve but in winter, never again.

Working as expected - wool dryer balls
Reviewed in Canada on January 13, 2023Verified Purchase
I've only used the wool dryer balls 5 times so far.  I do see less wrinkles, and much less static cling, they are 100% scent free.  I still get some static if the fabric is more of a plush finish like in a bathrobe or some fluffy microfiber clothes.Very quiet even in small or delicate loads.  I like that the wool dryer balls comes in a cloth bag, keeps it all together nicely.  I found the price very reasonable and saves on the cost of dryer sheets or liquid fabric softener as I also switched to using vinegar (makes the clothes soft and keeps your washing machine cleaner.)

Gramma loves her new stroller
Reviewed in Canada on January 18, 2024Colour Name: grayVerified Purchase
My first grandchild is 6 mo old and i needed a stroller. Did my research and decided this was the one that had all the features i wanted. The double wheels that rotate 360* on all 4 wheels is a game changer, must have for control, durability and 1 handed maneuvers. The seat lays flat or adjusts to 3 levels of sitting up. The fabric is strong and having the option to attach the sunshade is important for the child’s comfort and protection.  It folds easily and is light weight enough this 68 yr old gramma can get it in and out if the car no problem. Love that the weight limit is higher than the other umbrella strollers i looked at., good to 55 pounds, so many years of use ahead. Highly recommend. great value for the price.

Great for older Disney kids
Reviewed in Canada on February 13, 2024Colour Name: Jet blackVerified Purchase
I purchased this so my 7 year old could use for our recent disney trip. Anyone knows disney can be too much walking for some of the little ones. It's not uncommon to see larger children in strollers. My child was 48 lbs and 4 feet tall. zero issues fitting inside, even with canopy open. Child stayed comfortable. By keeping the kiddo happy, it made our trip so much more enjoyable 😉! Child was also able to nap as needed. We were out from sunrise until park close most days. The stroller had a nice storage area underneath. We were able to place a backpack under the stroller easily. Cupholder isn't the best but it's okay. Stroller was very easy to maneuver, wheels turned easily, height of stoller made pushing it comfortable for us parents. Foe our flights, we gate checked the stroller and had zero issues with all our travels. Stroller held up great. If you need a stroller for a larger kid for disney or a vacation, look no further!

Do not hesitate to buy this
Reviewed in Canada on July 26, 2023Colour Name: grayVerified Purchase
I bought this stroller in May of this year for my baby, who was six months at the time and weighed about 6 Kg. I had to go abroad urgently, and I needed a stroller that I could use across each transit. The stroller that I was currently using at the time was too big and would not be approved to take through the airport all the way to the flight gate, so I bought this one. Trust me, you need this stroller, especially if you are finding one that's light and sturdy to use at the airport. When returning back, I had three transit however when I arrived at the first transit, somehow the airlines messed up and sent my stroller with the baggage, which meant that I would get it at my destinations baggage claim.I was freaking out because to me the stroller seemed fragile, I didn’t think that it could survive another two transits and I know with the way that baggage is handled. I was expecting one of the tires to not be there or for the stroller to be broken. However, when I arrived back the stroller was perfectly fine. The tires run smoothly and the stroller is sturdy.I love that you can pull back the seat so that the baby can lay down. It is also very easy to open and close. Definitely worth buying. It’s summer now and we have gone on light hikes with the stroller and it’s perfectly fine.Put your money here you won’t be disappointed.If you are going to buy the stroller for a small baby, like I did, please buy a a support pillow for their head and neck so when they sleep, their neck doesn’t hurt from bending all the way down.

Lightweight and economical. We bought this for a family trip to Mexico. It is nice and easy to push with a smooth ride and good wheels. The umbrella is good. However, folding it is sometimes finicky and you have to fiddle with it a bit which is annoying. Another issue is that the drink holder doesn’t stay in place properly and we ended up removing it altogether because it became an inconvenience. The straps are also super difficult to adjust. The handles are alright. I may buy a higher quality travel stroller at some point but this one is great if you want something easy/cheap and if don’t care about those finicky things I mentioned.

Please don't waste your money on this stroller. I bought this in February and already the foot rest ripped on both sides, 2 screws popped out and needed replacing, the flimsy-ass cupholder fell off somewhere and the handlebar ""foam"" has ripped in several places, there is a constant squeeking sound. I've called and emailed the company over 2 months with no reply or being on hold for an hour - while being told there are 6 ppl ahead of me - and only heard back when i got rude. There is a 90 day warranty so they cant replace anything. Do yourself a favour and skip over this garbage stroller or you will be buying replacement parts in a few months. As folks here are prone to say, ""If I could give this 0 stars, I would""

I honestly was not expecting to get two controllers, let alone two WORKING controllers. The console runs flawless (so Far) with no indication of any problems or anything to suggest it will fail anytime soon. Color, picture and sound is 100%. I played it straight outta the box for hours. I even contacted the  person who restored this very console, just to thank him. We all take a risk buying 30+ year old hardware, its nice to know there are some people out there putting such care into keeping the classics alive and well.

I was excited to receive this because my old one doesn't work anymore. However, when I plugged everything in and turned it on, it doesn't work at all. There is no video output, and all there is is a buzzing sound. I also replaced all the cords to see if that was the issue, but that still did not fix it. This is extremely disappointing and I will be returning this soon, the people selling this product should test to see if it works before taking a customer's money.

Stronger than me
Reviewed in Canada on January 22, 2023Size: 3m x 3cm x 2mmVerified Purchase
I used this to mount several lighting fixtures and it surprisingly works. I rent so the least damage I can do to the walls the better. The light fixtures have been up for almost a whole year and they’re still holding strong! The only fear I have is that when I eventually remove the tape it will peel off the paint, but so does regular scotch tape, but that’s okay, nothing another coat of paint can’t fix. I haven’t tried removing it yet, but when putting up the lights, I had to adjust the placement before I pressed down, and even then with just little contact to the surface it was quite hard to remove. Might need to call in reinforcements when the time comes.

Not sure why but I never knew this existed until a friend raved about it. I mean I've long used double sided tape, 3m adhesive, sticky pads, etc, but this almost like the best of all worlds. The first example I saw was the power power stuck on the side of the table and I was sold. Double sided tape, unless I paid for the expensive stuff, would never hold it for long. Command strips are great but are also very costly, this roll feels endless. That was my first fix and voila, worked like a charm. Now I used it to keep rugs from running, i thought those thin sticky liners would do the trick but this is much better. Used it also on my kitchen utensils tray to keep it from sliding when opening the drawer. Best part - doesn't leave a sticky residue and peels off easily.

Great adherence but damage when removing
Reviewed in Canada on June 2, 2021Size: 5m x 3cm x 2mmVerified Purchase
I have a mixed opinion on this tape. Yes it sticks very well. We used it to hold our rig down to the floor over winter. For the most part it held up in most places except where the salt was very heavy. We also used it to hold a picture to the wall so we did not need a nail. Again product gel up extremely well. That being said when it came time to remove it removed a small piece of laminate flooring ( the wood look part of the floor) and it also removed a large piece of Drywall and paint on our wall. Frustrating for the wall I should have used the nail. This is a great product of u plan on never removing. Also it says this is reusable. Not it will come of in tiny pieces.

I picked this up expecting it would be sticky but not as much as the 3M product.  Wrong! This stuff goes on easily, but, figuring it wasn't as strong as 3M, used a larger piece.  I just spent 5 minutes pulling on a poster.  It took a lot of force to get it to unstick but there was no damage to the wall or the poster.  I took the piece I had cut and cut it in half (a 4 cm piece to 2 2 cm pieces) and it works well.  3M pieces are 1"" x 1"".

One of the best Ear Thermometer- Easy to use, Professional Grade Accuracy, Takes guesswork out
Reviewed in Canada on October 3, 2020Verified Purchase
When it comes to Ear Thermometers, Braun is considered gold standard and regarded as benchmark for accuracy. My family doctor also recommends Braun. I have used Braun Thermometer for years and my old Braun is still working like charm for last 10 years. So when I needed to upgrade my thermometer, I decided to choose their top of the line Braun Thermoscan 7 Thermometer and I am quite pleased with this advanced thermometer. Thermometer is well designed and easy to use. All the buttons are easy to understand and most people would be able to figure out without even reading the manual.KEY FEATURES:PRE-WARMED TIP: One of the major thing that differentiates Braun from other cheaper brands is it comes with patented pre-warmed tip. The tip on other thermometers can cool the area where the reading is taken, which can lead to inaccurate readings. The tip on the ThermoScan is warmed before use, to ensure professional grade accuracy.EXACTEMP GUIDANCE SYSTEM: This feature ensures that thermometer is positioned in ear correctly and taking correct reading. This is confirmed by a beep and light.AGE PRECISION COLOUR CODED DISPLAY: This is one of my favourite feature on Thermoscan 7. This feature differentiates Thermoscan 7 from other Braun Thermometers such as Thermoscan 5. I didn’t know that definition of “fever” changes with age. On Thermoscan 7, you begin with choosing the one of the three correct age groups (0-3 Months, 3-36 Months and 36+ Months). Thermometer screen will glow Green, yellow or Red light which makes very easy to interpret the results. The coloured screen means that I don’t have to panic and search on Google what classifies as a fever. I’m able to just concentrate on looking after my kids.THE GOOD:(1) Professional Grade Accuracy(2) Large easy to read backlit display. Display with night light- perfect for reading at night time.(3) Quick and fast measurement(4) ExacTemp technology confirms that thermometer is properly positioned and taking accurate reading(5) Pre-warmed tip(6) Age precision technology completely takes the guesswork out of interpreting child’s temperature(7) 9 Memory allows to track results over the time.(8) Ejector button for easy lens-filter removal.(9) You change temperature scale from °F to °C.(10) Comes with storage cradleTHE BAD:(1) Braun Lens filter are on expensive side. Ongoing costs with lens filters is little high.OTHER OPTIONS:Fo Ear Thermometers, Braun is the brand I trust so if I have to compare Thermoscan 7 with something else it would be Thermoscan 5. Thermoscan has all the same technology to ensure accurate measurement, but it does not have Age precision Technology and Colour Coded Display. It also o does not have front panel display with light light.FINAL THOUGHTS:The overall design and feel of Thermoscan 7 is great. It’s easy to use, takes guess work out and makes it easy for novice users to take professional grade accurate readings every single time. It costs more but provides lots of peace of mind. Like my previous Braun I am confident it will last very long and only thing that will make me upgrade it again would be newer technology.

Reviewed in Canada on February 2, 2021Verified Purchase
This Braun thermometer is very straightforward to operate and is very easy to read and to interpret the results.  You start by covering the tip with a new disposable lens filter (A small portion of filters are included in this kit to get you started) After turning it on with the power button, you first select the age group of the child you are testing by pressing a few times on the ''Age precision button ''until you obtain the desired age group (the button looks like a baby crawling on all fours).Once the age has been selected, you just need to press on the ''temperature taking button'' which is at the top of the device (the button looks like a mercury thermometer).  You then insert the tip into the ear, and keep it there until you hear a beep, which will indicate that the thermometer has obtained the measured temperature.The thermometer screen will not only show the measured temperature in degrees, but the screen's background color will indicate if there is a fever or if the temperature is normal.  The screen will either be green (which means that there is no fever), yellow (which means there is a light fever) or red (which means there is a high fever).  It takes around 2:29 seconds to provide a reading.I have tested and compared the readings with my older trusty thermometer and both were consistently showing very similar results each time.  I have used it on myself and on my toddler, who really doesn't like having his temperature taken.  I did manage to successfully get accurate results multiple times without him making too much of a fuss.  Every time I use this thermometer, I really enjoy the fact that I don't have to double check any numbers to find out if he has a fever or not.  The color indicator confirms that for me.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  Would definitely recommend.If my review was helpful let me know by clicking on the ''Helpful'' button :) 👍🏻

That is a huge bonus. Able to adjust it for the babes age. This makes it very easy to check the temperature in the middle of the night , to reassure our worrying minds :).

Don’t waste your time. Just buy the Braun. Spend your money and time on a quality thermometer. I’m an ECE and constantly dealing with sick kids and temperatures and I feel so foolish that I waited around to buy one. We use these at work all the time and now I have one of my own for home. Easy to use. I love it. It’s worth it.

Another great Canon product!
Reviewed in Canada on October 18, 2014Style: DCVerified Purchase
My former Canon was the XTi, excellent unit.  Unfortunately I dropped it.....  The new T3 is different, but very good.  It has the slightly bigger sensor, making for very clear pics.  It weighs a little less, shoots faster in multiple mode, comes with an image stabilized lens, has more adjustability when choosing image size and so on.  I've only had it for a couple of weeks so far, but I'm extremely pleased with the camera.  The other thing...it is half the price of the XTi...cannot complain about that.  The only thing missing is the sensor cleaner, which I have not missed.  And it clears files off the sensor in a second or two, unlike the XTi which would take ten times as long - or more - if you had many images in the camera.  All in all a most excellent little unit.

I'm constantly getting compliments on my photographs and get asked all the time who i hired as a photographer for the fun photo shoots I do with my son! I've honestly SAVED SO MUCH MONEY buying this camera, because its prevented me from hiring out photoshoots for his milestone/holiday pictures and I've had so much fun doing them with him!

Great Product for Beginners
Reviewed in Canada on March 12, 2013Style: DCVerified Purchase
I chose to give this Canon Rebel T3 a 5 out of 5 star rating because it is simply a great camera to use as a beginner photographer. The camera is easy to use, looks sleek, and doesn't feel like a 'cheap' camera. The menu functions are easy to use and the battery has incredible battery life, (I have only charged my battery 1 time in 4 months). The picture quality is good but not great, keep in mind it is only a beginner camera. For the price I paid, ($360.00 during black Friday deals) I feel this camera deserves nothing less than 5 out of 5. Good job Canon.

This is a great consul. After coming from a PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 pro it's nice to get back into the Xbox system. I had an original Xbox and an Xbox 360, but skipped the Xbox, one generation and got a PlayStation four and aforementioned PlayStation 4 pro. I had an OG PlayStation way back in the day, and though I looked at the PlayStation five, I found that the Xbox has a better selection at the moment. Yes, the PlayStation 5 does have some good exclusive games but the backwards compatibility with the Xbox so I will need to play some classic games like split second and others is a great thing. Sony only has backward compatibility to the PlayStation 4 though. There are only about 60 original Xbox games backwards compatible with the series X, but it's still pretty amazing and then there are so many Xbox 360 games that you can just plug in your old disk and play. Something you could never do on the PlayStation.The big feature that is so impressive here is the resume play function. To have seven or eight or nine games on the go all at once, and be able to switch back-and-forth between them at a whim with a delay of only seconds between swapping is an amazing thing. Well done Microsoft!

Xbox One X Perfected
Reviewed in Canada on November 15, 2020Platform for display: Xbox Series XEdition: Console OnlyVerified Purchase
The Xbox Series X addresses the Xbox One X's weakest point: speed. It has a powerful CPU in addition to its monstrous GPU and has built-in SSD. You'll be impressed with the speed from the get-go. The initial setup was super fast and it even allows you to copy settings from the cloud that it backed up from your previous console.You'll be up and running in no time, and if you are a Gamepass subscriber, you'll have great games to play such as Gears Tactics & Tetris Connected. You'll have to be patient though as they download or as you apply the Series X optimization patches. While the delay of Halo Infinite's launch left a big hole in the launch lineup, it did not really bother me as I have more than enough launch games to play. Yakuza Like a Dragon is quite fun and looks fantastic on the console. Tetris Connected, while not a graphical showcase, manages to look quite cool and flashy, and  is incredibly addicting with numerous online and solo game modes.The backwards compatibility truly shines and it is a joy going back to some of your favorite titles that perform better now with the power of the Series X. Forza Horizon 4 and Gears 5 never looked so good at 4K-60fps. The new controller is not a big change, but since I use the Elite 2 anyways, that didn't bother me all too much. I quite like how the new controller feels and it seems they made some minor yet meaningful tweaks to it overall. The bumpers seem more responsive to me and the share button is a useful addition.Looking forward to seeing what's next for this powerful console and I am very impressed with the overall package so far.  Cheers

Xbox meets all expectations, The game quality is great.There's no loading times 4K is amazing And game pass ultimate is way past beyond expectation. The only.Thing that I have an issue with.Is the firmware on the controller and the functionality/hardware, There is major stick drift right out of the box and controller disconnects intermittently. Can be resolved for the most part by updating the software for the controller, in the IO peripherals menu and recalibration. QC is sub par in regards to the controller. I recommend doing research to find a quality controller without above issues.

Just kidding.  This was the hottest sauce I have ever eaten.  It felt like my head was melting from the inside out.  I drank milk, ate pudding, ate ice, drank water, ate bread; nothing really helped except for time.We bought this based off of that show (you know which one). I don't think this is the official sauce used on that show, but it doesn't matter.  This thing is plenty hot enough for you and your family.  Maybe not your pets.  The cats stayed out of the room as soon as this stuff was opened.For best result, cook this in with your nuggets or wings or whatever rather than just dabbing and dipping.  This ensures no cheating and does not cause an over-concentration of Flavor City in any one area of your mouth.

In short, we buy hot sauce frequently and it adds up.However, this hot sauce is so spicy that a few drops is all it takes! I’ve never seen a bottle of hot suave last so long in hour house hold! I know many people are saying it’s gone up in price, but it’s definitely worth it because it will last a while! Nobody is going to guzzle this hot sauce in a span of a week. It’s truly the bomb!

I'm someone who grew up eating spicy foods, so when I order something ""spicy"" from Canadian restaurants, it barely tickles my throat. When my girlfriend takes a bite of my plate of food, she coughs and tears up from the spice level if I'm having a spicy dish.With that being said, Da Bomb made me feel like a human being with a normal spice tolerance again. I lightly coated a dry rib with this sauce and after eating all of the meat off of the bone, I proceeded to tear up and take some sips of water. I did not ""freak out"", but I definitely had to stop and try to collect myself while working through the pain for 4 to 5 minutes. My girlfriend got a kick out of it because she's never seen me respond this way to any hot sauce, ever, for over 8 years.Like others, we ordered this hot sauce because of it's notorious place as the 3rd last hot sauce on the show Hot Ones on YouTube. All the guests seem to respond to this hot sauce as being the one that really kicks them in the butt as they near the last of the wings.I actually have the final hot sauce from a couple of seasons back ""The Last Dab Redux"", which registers at multiples of spice levels higher than Da Bomb, but I can confidently state that Da Bomb is actually much hotter than The Last Dab Redux. The reason for this is Da Bomb is actually made with pepper extract as opposed to fresh peppers (like The Last Dab Redux). Pepper extract registers at a lower spice level in scoville units, but in reality, the heat is actually much hotter than in a fresh pepper.So, if you want to test your might against the hottest of the hot, I have not tried ANYTHING hotter than Da Bomb.May God have mercy on your rectum... and mine.The End.

Don't mess around with this sauce. Don't eat on an empty stomach.
Reviewed in Canada on February 26, 2023Verified Purchase
This sauce will add the bite you're looking for to any meal of your choice. If it's your first time I recommend shaking the bottle and pressing your pinky into the inside of the cap to collect a small drop that you can taste for yourself. Do not consume until you have done this. I applied some to a cornchip and gave myself bad stomach cramps by applying 6 dollops like it was a measly Franks Red Hot. Never again. When dosed correctly in food it has the perfect bite you want and is very tolerable. Start slow and work your way up. Very good sauce. Will last you a long time. Also not vinegary at all. I don't even think vinegar is an ingredient in this sauce. A small amount goes a long way with this sauce. Just a drop will make your nose burn and your face hot and sweaty. Highly recommended.

Haptic is fantastic. Ergonomic design - better late than never, sony.
Reviewed in Canada on January 30, 2024Verified Purchase
As for these controllers they’re amazing and finally built solid. Quality reflects msrp price.Blows x-box controller out of the water imo.Aptly because it’s designed with perfect symmetry. The controller gets 5* really.However, I’ve ordered two warehouse deals that were too generously described so i knocked a good ol’ star. They were both clearly someone else's used and abused controller.it’s obvious that - when someone damages a controller via their bad temper, they order a new one - issue return and repackage the broken one in its place. (Amazon can’t test beyond visual inspection so its a gamble.) It’s actually a vicious cycle and amazon is harder and harder to trust - at least with ps5 controller sales.I can polish off scratches via tlc. I can live without the original packaging to… But can’t deal with 2-3mm deep trackpad scratches.There is also the fact that, the controller that triggered this review is a complete dud and won’t actually take a charge - let alone turn on.

Castor Oil has been used for centuries as a beauty cabinet staple for skin, hair, nails, lashes, brows and more. It’s most famously used in Castor Oil Packs, an ancient self-care practice.    WHY CASTOR OIL IN AMBER GLASS, NOT PLASTIC? An amber glass bottle is a MUST with Castor Oil! Castor Oil is the ultimate carrier oil that can permeate and carry substances deeply into the layers of skin. Avoiding Castor Oil bottled in plastic reduces exposure to hormone-disrupting chemicals.    WHY CERTIFIED ORGANIC, EXTRA VIRGIN, & HEXANE-FREE CASTOR OIL? Opting for these varieties is crucial to avoid hormone-disrupting pesticides, herbicides and solvents like hexane    CAN I DRINK CASTOR OIL OR TAKE CASTOR OIL CAPSULES FOR CONSTIPATION? No, Queen of the Thrones Castor Oil is for topical use only. Taking Castor Oil orally is known to be a stimulant laxative, applying it topically with a Castor Oil Pack is a much gentler approach.    HOW DO I USE IT? Simply apply the Castor Oil to your skin, hair or nails; use it as a natural makeup remover, or a soothing massage oil. Pair it with your favorite Queen of the Thrones Castor Oil Pack for Liver, apply before dry brushing or body rolling, or combine it with other natural ingredients to create your own face masks, hair masks, exfoliating scrubs and more.

Very Impressed
Reviewed in Canada on March 1, 2024Verified Purchase
I just started using this brand and am already impressed. It is quite thick, but is easy to work with. I'm happy that there's no strong smell, just a mild natural scent. It smells a bit ""nutty"" to me, but very mild. Once it's on the skin I don't even notice it. I've already had success with using castor oil in the past, but this brand is superior to the one I was using before. I highly recommend it. It does make the skin soft and smooth, and somehow improves the overall appearance. I'm going to try it for some health related issues and will see how it goes. I do believe the hype I hear about castor oil, because I've spent 30+ years working in the health field and heard and seen a lot of positive things about it.

The product stopped working 5 months after purchase. Expensive failure.
Reviewed in Canada on August 28, 2023Colour Name: RedVerified Purchase
I was loving the gun in the beginning. I purchased this item to use for dog training and was quite careful with this gun. The dogs were never shot up close, but it was used to tag them when they would bark at the edge of the yard about 30' away. This totally worked and was awesome.What isn't awesome. The Sprya2 stopped being able to shoot water at all about 5 months in. It still attempts to suck water in, but seems to suck it in into an infinite loop such that the water starts to just come out of the side of the gunI tried a couple suggestions that was on the Sprya2 website without any success in getting the gun able to fire water again. By the time I paid for shipping and border fees this water gun was $300 or so. I attempted to contact anyone at Sprya but they do not have a specific contact for any issues or support that I can see, only order tracking. If you don't mind paying $300 ish after all is said and done to have a water gun that lasts a handful of months, then this gun is for you.

Si on allume vite et qu'on tire, il peut se bloquer. Il faut alors procéder à un réamorçage connecté du logiciel: au-dessus d'un lavabo, avec le Spyra branché sur l'usb, on maintient le bouton pendant quelques secondes et le symbole [] clignote et le spyra éjecte de l'eau.

Let's not kid ourselves, everyone knows by now that PS5 controller Battery Life are not that great.TIP: if you want a better fighting chance with Battery life efficiency, just disable the Microphone and all Haptic feedbacks. I know it's against the Playstation ""Experience"" principle but what can you do, gotta make some compromises for longer play sessions.Apart from that, the color is really nice, the build is sturdy. No Joystick drifts. You get what you pay for. It's an official PS5 controller, not a Third-Party controller. Yes, it's more expensive but at least you get all the built-in features without any surprises.Highly recommended.

Great for the price.
Reviewed in Canada on September 22, 2020Verified Purchase
I needed a beginner size, and these worked good. I was able to go to the largest by the end of my first session. Super easy to clean, feels nice temperature wise. I have only 2 complaints.  Firstly, bases the first two sizes don’t seem that big or sturdy enough, I was anxious using them and didn’t trust myself to let go of the base of them while using, let alone stand up or move with them. The largest size base is much larger and thicker, and I felt confident with that one not going in. However my second complaint is that the edges of that base didn’t feel super smooth so it kind of hurt to move, felt like it was chafing me a bit. Other than that, great for the price and great beginner set.

Fine for the price
Reviewed in Canada on March 22, 2021Verified Purchase
These are just what I was looking for. Great if you want to use oil based lube. I find the metal more comfortable than silicone and much better to clean. The weight is nice on them. I did however have a small problem with one. There was what looked like bubbles under the metal. I had to exchange. I do not know if they are coated. They do not look like the high end steel ones but that is reflected in price. If you are looking for a simple training kit this is great until you work up to the size you like then you can invest in a solid steel one at a higher cost.

Smaller than I thought.
Reviewed in Canada on October 29, 2020Verified Purchase
I was a little disappointed that these are way smaller than I thought. I consider myself as a medium level user and even the largest one is smaller than the one I am using. They are quite comfy for extended use so it's a bonus point. I haven't opened the other two but the largest one came with a scratch on it.

Great to connect a camera or device with 5-pin MiniB USB female port to any USB 2.0 devices (like printers, hubs, laptops, etc)!
Reviewed in Canada on February 27, 2017Size: 1.8 MetersStyle: 1-PackPattern Name: CableVerified Purchase
I purchased this cable to connect my sister's new Canon PowerShot camera that has a 5-pin Mini B USB port, in order to connect it to peripheral devices such as her laptop, computer, printers, external hard drive, and memory card reader/writers with or without a USB hub. Suffice to say, if you want to connect your camera or other device with a 5-pin MiniB USB port to your printer, card reader or reader/writer, laptop, computer, external hard drive for USB 2.0/Type B, or USB 2.0 hub (or USB 3.0 hub downward compatible with USB 2.0 cables)...then look no further. Do not waste money to buy a cable that is specifically listed for your camera or other device (eg. USB 2 cable for Canon PowerShot SX540 HS)!This cable is to connect a female (hole) port into another female USB 2.0 port so it must have male (the piece that you fit into a port) ends on both sides. I began with no knowledge of USB ports, accessories, and devices, aside from knowing that there are different USB types for my laptop, cell phones, and tablet. I found some helpful review sites for USB information (including USB 3.0/Type A, USB 2.0/Type B, USB 3.1/Type C, micro-USB, mini USB, and Apple lightning ports), most of which link to Amazon. Just google/search for USB Guide or the specific USB port on your device ""to USB 2/3"" since most cables and adapters are labelled accordingly. You want to search for a cable, you must make sure that the ends that insert into ports are male, and the ends that you want to insert into are female.Another tip: I am fairly new to Amazon (~2 months of intensive shopping, after a few purchases years prior), and despite knowing that AmazonBasics items are an additional 20% off if you purchase more than one at checkout, I have forgotten to do so every time, including when I purchased this cable. If your buying this cable, you may want an AmazonBasics USB 2.0 extension cable (USB 2.0 male to female) or one of many AmazonBasics items available. I am not trying to advertise for Amazon; just trying to prevent someone from repeating my mistakes!I apologize if my information about different USB technologies is overly simplistic or un-informative because I have just begun to understand the complex world of ports, cables, hubs, and adapters; this is aimed to help people who have very little knowledge like when I shopped for this item.Thank you for reading my review (I appreciate this review community so I am trying to give back)!

This cable is a heavy gauge wire and very stiff to bend. I bought it to use with my GPS in my vehicle but the wire is so stiff I ended up not using it. The large USB end is not fastened into the molded grip very well and I think if it were in a tight USB port it would pull out. It's OK at best. In hindsight I should have spent a few more bucks and got a brand name cable.

The All Natural Advice Vitamin C Serum has become an absolute staple in my skincare routine, and I can't sing its praises enough. This serum has been a game-changer for my skin, delivering exceptional results that are hard to ignore.First and foremost, the formulation is outstanding. Packed with potent vitamin C, it has worked wonders in brightening my complexion and giving my skin a healthy, radiant glow. The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy residue – a perfect addition to my morning routine.I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture of my skin since incorporating this serum. It has helped diminish the appearance of fine lines and has contributed to a more even skin tone. My skin feels smoother, firmer, and more youthful.What sets this product apart is its commitment to being all-natural. Free from harsh chemicals and additives, it's gentle on my skin yet incredibly effective. The addition of hyaluronic acid and vitamin E adds an extra layer of hydration and protection, making it a comprehensive solution for skincare.The packaging is not only sleek but also practical, with a convenient dropper that dispenses the perfect amount of product. It's evident that All Natural Advice prioritizes both quality and user experience.In conclusion, the All Natural Advice Vitamin C Serum has exceeded my expectations. If you're looking for a serum that delivers on its promises, promotes healthy skin, and fits seamlessly into your routine, look no further. This product is a gem, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking radiant and revitalized skin.

Just what I expect with a, Vitamin C Serum.Only issue is, Vitamin C Serums need to be treated with the same respect as other, Actives. Vitamin C is highly degradable when light or air come in contact with it. Which then the product is no longer beneficial.Vitamin C should be packaged in a very very dark dark amber bottle with pump already on the bottle.This my only issue.Love Love the Ingredients!

It works but it is a very small quantity
Reviewed in Canada on November 6, 2023Size: 60 ml (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
No need for a big write up telling you what it did for my skin, because it does what it says but every skin type is different.What I need to say is I find it very expensive, because it ran out in less than a month. You need to use a sizeable amount, it doesn't spread out much( my skin drinks it up and literally doesn't spread far) so alot is needed in perspective of the amount  in the bottle.The packaging is also very minimalistic, I found. Like it seemed to have very little information like benefits and how to use... it just had very basic directions. Paraphrased=""clean face and apply to skin""(this was a couple months ago now so I don't remember exactly what it said, I just remember feeling the packaging was lacking in info)This product worked but isn't a crucial part in a face routine. It also runs out very quickly, so my overall thought on this is ""too expensive & not necessary""I won't be buying again, but not because it doesn't do what it says.

Great Natural & Organic Serum, Canadian Too!
Reviewed in Canada on December 18, 2018Size: 60 ml (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I bought this product last week to improve the appearance of my skin. I'm 41 with a very sensitive type of skin that tends to be oily. I want to be able to control my rosacea and prevent wrinkles, and I hope the scarring on my face will fade more quickly with this serum. So far, after only a few times using the serum, it seems my skin is already changing with less redness and a great glow. It feels great to apply on the skin, it's a quick step in my routine since it's easy to apply and it dries pretty quickly. Love the scent too, it's smells kinda like an orange, very refreshing. Sometimes, I had the sensation that it was burning my skin a bit when applying it, but after about 30 minutes the redness and tingling/burning were gone. I've never bought anything from All Natural Advice before, but now I'm thinking I should try some of their other products. I like knowing what I put on my skin. Knowing the ingredients, that the product is natural & organic and that it was made by a Canadian company makes me feel great. This is a good choice of vitamine C serum, I recommend it to everyone! I can't wait to see the effects on my skin in the long run!...2 WEEKS LATER...I have been using this serum for longer, a few weeks now... The texture of my skin is changing, it's plumper and healthier, my fine lines are less noticeable than before (face & neck). The burning feeling when applying the serum is gone now, I guess my skin had to get used to the product. The 60 ml bottle will last for about 2 months and I'm using it on my face, my neck and sometimes, the top of my chest. I'm going to continue using this vitamin C serum because I think the long term effects will be worth the wait.

Reviewed in Canada on May 4, 2021Verified Purchase
Best purchase ever!!My baby loved it!!! It’s amazing!I would definitely recommend!!I read a review at some point that the swing was noisy so I was scared to buy it, but I bought it anyways!! At some point it did make noise BUT thats only because someone moved the legs from the swing a closer together! So all I did was pushed them more a part and the noise stopped! It only happened once! It’s not because of the swing at all!The only thing that I hated was that the music had a timer of around 20min. So I had to keep coming back before 20min to start it back again.  My baby suffered from Silent Acid Reflux and I couldn’t lay him down at all without the acid and milk coming back up which would cause him to choke on the milk that came back up. So laying him down was not an option for us! So the swing helped a lot since he was in an upward position, until the medication for his Acid Reflux started working!!We always kept an eye on him when he was on the swing to make sure he was ok!Love this swing!!!! Definitely recommend!!

Reviewed in Canada on July 18, 2019Verified Purchase
Of all my Amazon purchases, this has been the best! This is day two of using this swing for my 8 week old and she is on her fifth successful nap in it. She can fall asleep, wake up, and fall back asleep in it. Yesterday she had a three hour nap in it!The last six weeks, I have tried everything to get.my very tired baby to take naps. We had a different swing but she wouldn't nap in it. Wouldn't nap in her carseat without a fuss or for more than 20-30 minutes. Would nap in her bassinet with lots of help (getting her sleepy and then continually putting her soother back in). The only place she would nap was on a shoulder while bouncing on an exercise ball. And then about two weeks ago, she would fall asleep on my shoulder and only nap for 20 minutes and then I couldn't get her back to sleep. I had been looking at this swing for weeks and finally bought it. I should have bought it WEEKS ago. Although if I did, I'd be less fit than I am today 😂 But now I can pee, feed myself, do laundry, etc. while she sleeps, and I can actually enjoy her and play with her during her awake time, rather than running around trying to do everything during that 15 minutes that she happily plays by herself.Well done Fisher Price.A+Five stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Reviewed in Canada on January 21, 2019Verified Purchase
I thought my 2 month old hated swings, as he refused to settle in the two that were lent to me. I let him try an older version of this swing at my sister's place and he settled quickly. I was so thrilled that I ordered this from my phone on the spot. I think it is the direction he likes. He can swing side to side, where other swings I tried were up and down. This swing does both directions, so folks...you are covered no matter what. It plays daytime songs, lullabies or soothing outdoor noises, like crickets. He loooves his cricket noises...knocks him right out! It does make soft motion noises, but not loud and distracting, like some other reviews say. Takes up a lot of space but i like a sleeping baby more than I like getting my Feng Shui on

            Set this up on my own very pregnant, however it may have been a bit easier if I had waited for hubby to come home. But it can be done! Easily explainable to the men folk, easy to switch positions on the seat and direction for swinging. I ordered the matching bouncy chair too. Cute songs and sounds. Please don’t ever waste money on a swing that doesn’t have an AC outlet. I made that mistake 11 years ago with my first, constant power is crucial!!!

Genuine  Hitachi - Do your research. Love it, very powerful
Reviewed in Canada on November 3, 2015Verified Purchase
This is a genuine hitachi. Most comments I read here say"" it doesn't say hitachi on it,  it's fake "". Hitachi wanted to distance themselves from having their name on a sex toy, so the company Vibratex became the (sole) supplier. Mine has the Vibratex sticker on it. It is strong powerful and not as loud as i thought. My gf loves it,  it may be to strong  if anything.  Highly recommended,  gf was having multiple orgasms within minutes of each other. It actually feels great on the back and neck also!

Loved it but sadly after just over a year it died out. Was only used a few times and it overheated very easily.  Would love another one as it worked so well but hesitant now because it didn’t last very long. I wonder if hitachi would replace it even though I bought it from Amazon

Wife loves this. Very powerful.
Reviewed in Canada on June 1, 2016Verified Purchase
Wife loves this. If you are thinking about buying one just do it. No other toy really compares with it. We have a drawer full of more expensive ""massagers"" and this is the only one that ever comes out anymore. Seems a little unwieldy at first, but pretty easy to get used to. Also, it tends to do the job rather quickly so it is not in the way for long.Not totally embarrassing if you accidentally leave this out. Can actually pass as a ""massager"".The Amazon price is about half of what it would have cost me to buy it locally.

Mostly Great
Reviewed in Canada on October 30, 2022Verified Purchase
It is a shame that Hitachi discontinued their previous magic wand and replaced it with this one. Don't get me wrong, this is a good unit but it is a cheaper build and it only has 2 speeds. This is a real issue because I use the wand on my feet to control the neuropathy caused by my diabetes. Even on setting number 1 it is a pretty rough ride for my feet. It would be much better if it had 5 or more settings to start things off more gently.

Really enjoyed the game, and the statue that comes with it is great. The only complaint was with Amazon's Shipping. Was able to pre-order the game just before its release, but it took about a week and a half to leave the warehouse, and then another five days or so to get to me. (I don't have Prime). It wasn't the end of the world, but was disappointed.

It's pretty fun
Reviewed in Canada on November 27, 2023Edition: Collector's EditionVerified Purchase
It's a fun game some of the story feels a little bit kind of I suppose sewn together like there are parts that don't feel like a part of each other at all like they were written for different game's. I was a bit disappointed with the lack of individual suit power's like the first game had. Okay onto the good the statue is really cool and if you like these interpretation of the characters it's really cool looking! The gameplay is fast and fun admittedly I would have enjoyed more punching people and webbing them up in the game as it's a short game with essentially a bunch of go here collect this then you get a bit of story or a boss fight my favourite of these was the section with Cletus Kasady who will very likely be Carnage in a later game. The very brief amount of time that you get to play as Venom is really cool though as you can go out of bounds as him and even ride a bicycle but back-up your save first because you have to go through some hoops to do this and I would not count on your save being dandy as a lion if you go outside of the game's normal parameters. The black suit has black webs which is cool but if you try to switch to the black or symbiote suits later on the gooey parts in its animations are white for some reason it does NOT switch back and forth after you get the Anti-Venom suit.

Phone was already reset and ready to activate, which it did without issues. I hated the new colours on the 15 series and dont really care for USB C or anything like that as I have years of investments in lightning cables that work just fine. iPhone was shipped quickly and wrapped in bubble wrap in a box. Will keep this seller in mind for future purchases due to the great experience.

The collector's edition finally came in and Amazon did a job well done with the packaging. No damages whatsoever. I bought a second copy of ToTK in order to avoid tearing open the one that's included in the bundle. Overall, I am satisfied.Edit: It appears that I may have snagged one from the last batch at MSRP. For those that are still looking; I suggest checking out Bestbuy. They are still doing daily restock at random times during the day but sell out very quickly. I'm talking minutes here...

Great package but lacking in goodies diversity
Reviewed in Canada on June 4, 2023Verified Purchase
This collector edition is a step above what Breath of the Wild Special Edition offered, the box is smaller but is noticeably heavier and feel premium. The only problem in my opinion is the goodies in it. While the art book is great, the pins, the steelbook and the metal poster are useless as I don't see myself using those in any way.I'd actually say that BOTW SE was better for players who planned to use its goodies like the carrying case, while the TOTK is better for collectors who are planning to keep all of these in the box.It is a real failure if you actually compare it to another recent collectors, God of War Ragnarok.

It effortlessly removes pills and fuzz, leaving my garments looking fresh and rejuvenated. The ergonomic design makes it easy to hold and maneuver, and the rechargeable battery means I can use it wherever I need to without being tethered to an outlet. It's become an essential tool in my laundry routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to extend the life of their favorite fabrics!

Reviewed in Canada on February 22, 2022Style: BasicVerified Purchase
So I only recently purchased this shaver/de-piller and tried it out today for the first time. I wanted to test it out quickly and chose some new bamboo socks which I love but one pair has pilling from new slippers and new sweats. They're very intricately detailed on parts so I figured if would be a great place to experiment. Because of this, I opted for the spacer attachment (as most know who own bamboo socks, they are ""looped"" in tiny detail, all over.I don't know what I was expecting, last using this type of product many years ago that my parents had, a cheap drugstore brand and wasnt too impressive. Anyway, literally one swipe (on low) and ever single last imperfection was removed effortlessly, making them look brand new, I was actually taken aback as silly as that sounds. I then detailed both socks, and despite the very strong potential of snagging and ruining them, they came out beautifully, not a single tear and with being quite careful, it took me maybe a maximum of 2 minutes for both to be perfectly spotless.I am actually now really looking forward to revamping my hoodies (the main purpose of my purchase), plus throws and towels too.I spent a good amount of time researching which one to purchase and narrowed it down to three of them. One being over double the cost, zero customer support or warranty should a problem arise and no additional blades. The second, again no warranty, it had one extra blade, rechargeable yet a fair amount of reviews said it doesn't last more than 10 minutes. Which brought me to this model, it has three blades (two spares that come in a protective case, with 3 total it ""should"" be a long lasting product), the battery life appears to be good (from reviews), it has a sizable lint trap that's easily emptied (I can't imagine ever filling it up), the seller seems quite responsive and informative, and there's a 90 day 3rd party return/refund policy plus a 2 year warranty. It also comes with a small cleaning brush, as said a spacer, a protective cap, and a thin rope bag that fits everything in it...you only need to provide the two AA batteries.I feel this is a win, it's a great little gadget that is extremely useful and I anticipate will make many things looks like new again. 👌• • • Note: I plan to update my review once I have used this product long enough to fairly speak of battery life, performance on different materials and show the outcome, as well as overall durability.

Had it for a year then it stopped working
Reviewed in Canada on December 15, 2023Style: BasicVerified Purchase
I loved this fabric shaver when I first got it in 2022.  It breathed new life into several of my fuzz-covered garments.  Suddenly it started to slow down though.  I took it apart, cleaned it, and replaced the batteries, all to no avail. The motor isn't powering the device anymore.  I came back to Amazon to troubleshoot to see if I can fix it, but I think it's just done.  I would have given it a 5-star review when I first got it, but to die after such light use (I maybe used it on 10 tops in total) is unreasonable and wasteful.  I hate buying stuff that ends up in a landfill shortly afterwards.  I don't know if I got a dud, or if this is just a poor product.  I hope your mileage is better than mine.Edit:  Just wanted to report back to you, as the company reached out to me.  After some troubleshooting, my item was determined to be defective and they offered me a full refund.  They told me that they stand behind their product and offer a 2-year warranty.  I thought that was generous, as I had assumed that I was out of luck.  I am leery about repurchasing the same unit, but I am considering their upgraded lint remover that plugs in.  I changed my review from 2/5 stars to 3/5 to reflect the stellar customer service.  For the price, I think it's worth trying your luck on this unit if it is under warranty for two years after purchase.

This product is easy to use, even for the elderly, not overly complicated and you can check your blood pressure at the press of one button. I have been using it almost everyday since the purchase in feb 2023 and the velcro on the cuff is still good as new! The machine works great, I always check my pressure 3 times just to be sure and this machine is always in and around the same every time. No more going to the grocery store to check my pressure anymore! It does require 4 AA batteries so keep extras on hand!

This machine is the real deal. It is what was recommended from my pharmacy and they use it there for their patients.  I have tried the cuff one and it registers so high and is not accurate at all so I sent it back.  I compared this machine to two other machines that my family member had and  my doctors reading  and it is very accurate!...... So easy to use, wrap it around and push the start button. It goes by itself and does not squeeze my air like it was cutting off my circulation like some machines.  The only thing I don't really like, is that it turns off in 20 seconds, which I guess that is good if you forget to turn it off. So you better write down your results fast. I would highly recommend it. And the price was so cheap.

The Manscaped 4.0 hair trimmer: High-tech, good grip, fast charge, rinse clean, LED spotlight, travel lock, wireless charging dock. Great trimmer for athletes in hockey, rugby, boxing, free weights, wrestling, lacrosse, MMA, swimming & diving. Shave chest & mid-section with same pressure & speed as face shaver. Shave groin slowly, use light touch. Read instructions. Scissor-trim long hairs. Keep skin flat as you shave. Practice-shave with guards. Maintenance-shave without guards: trim to smooth skin or hair-length-length wanted. If nicked or if acne accidentally bleeds: stop it by dipping a styptic pencil (Amazon) in water & apply for a few seconds. Keeping shaved or at least well-trimmed is comfortable, cooler & drier for sports.MEN'S SPORTS GEAR: Wear a traditional jock+cup for men's ‘contact’ sports like hockey, football, boxing, martial arts, field or box lacrosse, rugby, soccer. But, for 'non-contact' sports, get a Tonus Elast suspensory jock instead. It supports & protects your balls better than a traditional jock or compression shorts. Simpler, cooler, drier, no leg-straps, avoids chafing inner legs. The front opening makes it easier to take a quick pee between sports or workouts. Best fit, by pouch, for most guys is small, but often out of stock. Waistband adjusts easy, trim excess length. Worn for basketball, volleyball, free weights+gym, cross-training, track & field, running, cycling, spinning, soccer (if traditional no jock+cup available), wrestling, racquetball, tennis, squash, indoor climbing. Mouthguards: basketball, free weights, 'contact' sports. If active in sports, keep a couple spare shirts, socks & jocks in your locker.

It’s well-made and a good product, however it’s not the best trimmer you can get by any means. It works as it should, it’s easy to use, and does a good job. It is not as powerful as I expected for the price I paid, but maybe it’s good not to have power when you’re shaving the nether regions? Hmm. I’m not unhappy with my purchase, but I would not buy again. I’m sure there’s a cheaper, equally as good trimmer out there that doesn’t have all the gimmicks.

 After owning this 4.0 model for 11 months it no longer holds a charge even after 3days of nonstop charging it now always dies after 5min or less once turned on. I owned the Manacaped 3.0 also and that died on me in a similar fashion after about 9months of use age.Every time I charge the 4.0 now (after Feb 11, 2023) it does not last and turns off very quickly. Somtimes it lasts 2-3min other times it will shut off after 15 seconds.Email sent to company, still waiting on a response (sent on Feb 12)Update: May 29, 2023- I’ve had the replace for about 2 months (it was a free replacement) and it’s already stopped working again the lights went first and then it stopped charging also and won’t turn on now..Update: June 30, 2023 - I received an email saying Manscaped would send me a replacement charger but after a month of waiting I still haven’t received a tracking number or an approx delivery. It’s a good product but they keep stopping charging or working, and the customer service isn’t exactly on point. Still waiting for the charger and I hope that fixes it, but if it’s actually the device I hope I don’t have to wait another month or two before getting a replacement.Update: July 13, 2023 - I finally received my replacement charger after 1.5 months of waiting and no updates throughout that entire time, i only received shipping confirmation a couple days ago, after it had already been in the mail for about a week or so. Ive had the new charger for a few hours now and still nothing. The new charger did NOT charge my broken device, so now i have to get back in the support queue and wait another 2-3 months to try and get a replacement device.... Im not even sure its worth it now since i haven't been able to use it for 3 months since first emailing about it not working.

Very impressed there are company’s that still care about customers.Worked well till one day I put it on the charging dock and the lights would not move on it and it got quite warm.  The pictures is what I found when I opened it up.  Not waterproof at all.  Garbage after 5 months.  Would not recommend. Warranty on here says 60 days.  What garbage support

Hilarious Fun for Adult Game Nights!
Reviewed in Canada on June 16, 2023Verified Purchase
I recently purchased the ""What Do You Meme? Adult Party Game"" for a game night with friends, and let me tell you, it was an absolute blast! If you're a fan of memes and enjoy a good laugh, this game is a must-have for your collection.The premise of the game is simple yet ingenious. Each round, a photo card featuring a popular meme is displayed, and players compete to come up with the funniest caption using their caption cards. The combinations are endless, and the results can be hilarious, especially when everyone's creativity and wit come together.What sets this game apart is its adult-oriented content. The captions can range from mildly risqué to downright outrageous, so it's definitely not suitable for younger players or those easily offended. However, if you're looking for a game to spice up your adult game nights and get everyone laughing uncontrollably, this is the game for you.The quality of the cards is excellent, with vibrant and clear images that capture the essence of the memes perfectly. The box is sturdy and well-designed, keeping all the cards organized and easy to access during gameplay. The rulebook is straightforward and easy to understand, so you can start playing within minutes of opening the box.I particularly appreciate the game's expansion packs, which provide even more cards and memes to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. They offer additional variety, ensuring that you won't run out of new combinations anytime soon. While the base game alone is entertaining, the expansion packs take it to another level.In terms of gameplay, ""What Do You Meme? Adult Party Game"" truly shines. It creates a lively atmosphere filled with laughter, friendly competition, and plenty of unforgettable moments. The game is highly interactive, allowing players to showcase their creativity and comedic timing. It's a fantastic icebreaker and a perfect way to bring people together.Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend ""What Do You Meme? Adult Party Game"" to anyone looking for a hilarious and entertaining addition to their game collection. Whether you're hosting a game night with friends or attending a social gathering, this game will provide countless laughs and unforgettable memories. Just be prepared for a night of uncontrollable laughter and endless fun!

Great game and was a hit at our party
Reviewed in Canada on January 10, 2019Verified Purchase
Purchased this item for our annual Christmas party and it was most definitely a hit. The game is pretty straight forward and if you have ever played Cards Against Humanity than you know exactly what you are getting into.The main difference between this and Cards Against Humanity is this game uses pictures of memes instead of sentences. For those who have never played either, the concept is simple. A picture is pulled, everyone playing than must choose a card from their hand (each containing different sayings) that works best with the picture. The Person who turns it is, then reads all the cards and picks their favorites. That easy.  However, having a picture to reference makes a huge difference as I'll explain. One of the most frustrating things I have found with cards against humanity is that plenty of times the funniest card is chosen as the winner (more often than not the most offside card as well) regardless of how well it works with the question on the black cards. Meaning the card that worked the best with the question, and should have won, ends up getting trumped by the infamous offside funny cards. With ""What do you Meme"", this issue is addressed, as having something visual to look at seems to make players focus more on what goes best with it, which in my opinion makes the game more fun.  The other great thing about this game is they suggest you print out and add your own images, which puts a completely different spin on things. We added a bunch to ours and it definitely raised the hilarity factor. However be aware of what pictures you add. Especially if you use the adult content cards. Things can get awkward when you have to read an X-rated card while looking at a picture of your grandma.  To sum this up, I would most definitely recommend this game. It was a hit at our party and I had more than 1 person ask me where I got it from.Pros:• Tons of replay ability• Compact and easy to transport compared to some other games• Can add your own pictures!• Expansions available• Great for large groups• Incredibly fun to play with tons of laughsCons:• Not necessarily a con but more of a warning. Adult cards can be extremely ""Adult"" so maybe take them out before playing with the in-laws• Another warning that's not really a con. If you choose to add your own pictures, and I recommend that you do, be leery of what you add. As I mentioned it can make for some awkward moments with the wrong picture.

I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH! It has become a new household favourite.
Reviewed in Canada on August 19, 2020Verified Purchase
The first time I played this game was at a sorority event and I loved it so much that I decided to get a game pack recently for my family. It is incredibly easy to introduce loved ones to the game and it has lots of memes we love and know.  It has made quarantine more enjoyable for all of us for sure. I gave this a four star rating instead of five stars though because memes are always changing so I think What do you Meme? should reflect the changing times but the memes were still pretty relevant and some are timeless. Also I think it is very wise of them for putting the mature content caption cards separate from the other caption cards. I definitely recommend this game if you want a fun, easy going game where the laughs are endless.

Product states that ""adult"" cards are sealed separately for those who don't want to mix them with all-age-friendly cards. This is false, as my friends and I, who don't like the vulgar cards, found many cards talking about ""penis"" and ""vagina"" topics OUTSIDE of the sealed ""adult-only"" package. Inaccurate description. Otherwise, the cards are hilarious and memes are great. Low quality of pictures for the some of the memes.

It does what I needed it to do, which is to connect a HDMI computer monitor to the back of my ThinkPad docking station.  I could have purchased a DP to HDMI cable, but I had lots of HDMI cables lying around already and didn't want them to go to waste.  I also like how the two end are separated by a short cable, instead of it being one massive hunk of plastic that sticks out from the back of my docking station.

Adapter works well, good value
Reviewed in Canada on October 27, 2015Verified Purchase
I got this for an HP laptop. I chose the adapter (not the cable) since it's portable and I've already got HDMI cables, and if it inadvertently gets yanked, tripped over, etc. there's an extra place to for it to come loose (between the adapter and HDMI cable) which reduces the chances of damaging the equipment compared to using a single cable or an adapter which doesn't bend.Feels pretty solid. The short (3-inch) cable is pretty thick/stiff and doesn't bend under its own weight but can easily be bent 180 degrees if needed (see pics.)Not much else I can say, it's working as expected.

Probably so many sad and disappointed kids/families on Christmas morning. Our cauldron would not work at all. Would not charge and would not turn on. After months of searching for this thing only to be let down is extremely disappointing and frustrating. Seems to be a very common issue that people’s cauldrons won’t charge and it’s clear that quality control went out the window in order to pump these out for Christmas. I can return the item, but it’s out of stock, so who knows if my daughter will ever get one now? This was the #1 item she asked for and we got a video of her opening it and she was so excited.

My grandson loved it!
Reviewed in Canada on February 11, 2022Verified Purchase
I don’t really much about the Magic Mixie but my grandson desperately wanted the blue one for his birthday. All I can say is that he was thrilled with his gift. Reports from his family verified it “worked” well at whatever it does. LOL I’m a happy grandma even though I had to pay more than it’s retail value because it was so popular and not otherwise available. It arrived within the estimated time frame so I could give it to him at his birthday party. The shipping and tracking information was excellent.

Was a big hit at Christmas
Reviewed in Canada on January 12, 2024Verified Purchase
While I think toys like these are overpriced, the child it was intended for loved it. A few adults were surprised with the action of it. While it was a little pricey for a stuffed toy, some of the locals stores were charging double and triple the amount I paid for it on Amazon. The stove itself is made from cardboard, except for the top and handle which is plastic, it can be used over and over again. The warm and ""babble"" of the toy can be reset and done again so it's not a ""one hit wonder"" type of toy. As the hype of the toy has calmed down, the oven has been reused for a kitchen for 18"" dolls and stuffed animals.

Awesome Idea, but one time use only.
Reviewed in Canada on January 10, 2024Verified Purchase
My daughter loved this and the concept is great, but it a one time use toy.  I get that the dough doesn’t actually turn into a plushy, but if they sold refills, the parents could set it up again and use the oven. They give you a bag to reuse the dough, but once the kids see the plushy made they don’t want the same plushy or they are expecting multiples, not the same one to reappear over and over again.  Really, once you use it, that’s it. A bit pricey for a one time use toy.

Best water bottle ever!
Reviewed in Canada on February 11, 2024Colour Name: Shy MarshmallowSize: 24 ozVerified Purchase
I came across an article called ""Stanley's are overrated. Get this water bottle instead"". That link brought me to the Owala water bottle. I love how there is a chug spout plus an internal straw. There's no grabbing at a mouth piece with your hands. The internal straw is my favourite thing about this water bottle. The shape of the bottle is also comfortable to hold in your hand, even for people with petite hands. What I really appreciated about this water bottle was that there were little stickers (easy to remove and didn't leave sticky residue) on the parts of the lid to guide you how the cap works! I thought the stickers were cute and totally genius! Bottle and lid are easy to clean. I did order their specific cleaning brush but it hasn't arrived yet. My kids even are intrigued by this water bottle after purchasing their own Stanley's (""it's trending right now"" was the answer to why they wanted Stanley's haha).  Extremely happy with this Owala purchase. It's helped me drink more water throughout the day as it keeps it nice and cold. It's also an adequate size. Not too big or small. Because it's leak proof when closed, you can throw it in your purse or bag without worrying about it spilling - can't do that with a Stanley! If you're looking for a reasonably priced water bottle with great function, absolutely get this one. Everyone in the family will be getting these as gifts this year!

A great water bottle!
Reviewed in Canada on March 11, 2024Colour Name: Shy MarshmallowSize: 40 ozVerified Purchase
I purchased the 40 oz (1.2 litre) Owala FreeSip in Shy Marshmallow colour and I absolutely love it. The cover design of the lid which allows you to sip without any effort via the internal straw, or chug from the larger opening above the straw hole is amazing. I see why they patented this. What’s also very clever is that the internal straw tube attaches to the lid on an angle, so you are able to drink all of your water and leave none at the bottom of the bottle. Genius.The outside of the bottle is powder coated metal, which has a nice texture to it. I also purchased the boot in grey (the same grey as the lid on the Shy Marshmallow bottle). It solves the problem of the metal clanging on the table whenever you put it down. It also helps add some grip to the bottle. If you get the 40 oz bottle, I’d recommend the boot to make the bottle quieter, grippier and protected from scratches and dents. This bottle truly is leak proof, with a lock to stop the top from opening accidentally. I will throw this in my bag sideways right next to my laptop without concern as this is truly, actually 100% leakproof.Thanks to the triple wall insulation the bottle doesn’t sweat when you have cold liquids in it too, so you really don’t have to worry about liquids getting on anything. There are a lot of nooks and crannies to clean, but luckily it’s dishwasher safe. I highly recommend this bottle.

 This bottle has definitely improved my life and has made it easier for me to stay hydrated at all times, I’m soooo happy with my purchase.Bottle insulation:This bottle works so wonderfully, it truly is triple insulated because I fill this thing with ice and over 24 hours there will still be some ice still in there!! I’m someone who loves ice cold water, but the ice in my usual cup melts after an hour, so I find myself constantly running back to the fridge for ice, so this has really changed the game for me.Design:Don’t get me started on the built in straw… I absolutely love this feature and I don’t think I could ever go back to a regular water bottle after using this. I also love that the safety lock doubles as a carrying handle, I use it as one all the time. The design is also very clean and minimal, and minimal parts make it very easy to clean (the lid, bottle, and straw) which is another bonus.aesthetics:This bottle has such a nice clean look to it, it feels high quality, and looks high quality. I just wanted a simple sleek look and the white & grey is exactly what I hoped for.Overall:I can’t recommend this bottle enough, if you don’t have a water bottle I highly recommend you get a high quality one because it will go a long way and make it easier for you to get the amount of water you need in a day… apparently nearly like 80% of people don’t drink enough water. Before I got my Owala I was debating between this, a yeti, or a Hydro flask, and I’m so happy I got this one I really feel like I made the right decision, can’t recommend it enough! (:

Reviewed in Canada on April 11, 2024Colour Name: Dreamy FieldSize: 32 ozVerified Purchase
I like that you can sip or chug. The sip is great in the current heat while driving as I can easily open the bottle with a click and sip without taking my focus off the road. My drink is kept cool & it's relatively easy to clean.The cover is also nice and covers the drinking part well but keeping dust etc out. I've had to work at sites where there's people blasting frames in and their dust/chips get everywhere.Was thinking of getting the largest size but got the 2nd largest just cause it's lighter & easier to hold while still holding a decent amount of water for a day.

I was pretty happy at first but some services stopped streaming one day. As it was new I returned thinking it was hardware. The new unit once hooked up also did the same. About a day later it all started working again. It was speedy and the interface was nice. A few days later same issue and I ordered the Fire 4K Max. Came in hooked it up and Wow!

Reviewed in Canada on December 24, 2022Colour Name: BlackCustomer Package Type: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase
I give it a five-star review just because it is a Texas Instrument calculator, but I am shocked by how the quality of the Ti-84 Plus CE has deteriorated over the years. The first Ti-84 calculator I got was for school eight years ago. I used it all these years until last month when I accidentally dropped a monitor stand on it and broke it.In comparison to the 8-year-old one, this calculator looks cheap and low-quality. The old one has a glossy and smooth touch to its keypad. This one looks plasticky and of cheap material. The old one has an LED light that comes on when I plug it into the charger; this new one does not. All this started getting me worried if this was a knock-off product, but it came with a software license, which is a strong indication it might be genuine. Even the literature that came with it was printed on cheap paper using a printer that was running out of toner.Nonetheless, I like the product. It has a clear display that is easier to see even when I'm not wearing my glasses. Also, it is easier to use than the Ti Nspire versions. So, I am keeping it.

Bought this keyboard for my music inclined son and initially I just had him use Magix Music Maker to make fun beats.  Then we saw it allowed midi inputs so I thought maybe a keyboard.  Well this one did the trick and he loves it.  it is compact but a great size to allow him to smash the pads and keys when he gets inspired!  Very happy with this purchase and look forward to see what the kiddo produces :)

AMAZING YOU WON'T REGRET IT
Reviewed in Canada on January 22, 2021Colour Name: Brushed Stainless SteelVerified Purchase
Between myself and husband we'd spend hundreds at Starbucks every couple months and I'd have a decaf long shot Americano with steamed heavy cream and sometimes even an extra long shot. Super picky about having amazing coffee. Once you go through the learning curve which, with the advice also  below, from another amazing customer review, you should get it down in about a couple days total. Once you have it down this coffee flavour and smoothness surpasses the best coffees I've had at Starbucks. Freshly ground coffee is the ultimate winner and it surpasses pre-ground easily so spend the extra moula and get the grinder! Your mouth will thank you :) The machine is amazing and beautiful and easy to operate once you read the instructions and look on you tube as to how to steam cream or milk exactly. You won't regret this coffee, I was using the same beans (Starbucks Espresso Decaf) pre-ground on a routine coffee maker and when put through this machine the flavour is so rich and smooth and it just lingers all over the inside of your mouth all over your tastebuds. Crazy. My mom is European and has had her share of coffees and espressos and I brought her a cup and she said it was the best coffee she's tasted, even better than the few she'd tried at Starbucks. Enjoy!Here's the review below I also used and I purchased those additions he mentioned all at once and it was super helpful and it made the experience so much smoother!1. I am a guy, who knew nothing about espresso machines before this. I am very mechanically inclined and don't usually read instructions. This was different - this machine is NOT self-explanatory and you NEED to read the instructions (which are well written, and even include a troubleshooting section). Don't get frustrated with this machine until/unless you have read (all) the instructions.2. This is not a 'stand-alone' purchase ... this machine costs around $500 (give or take), you need to invest another $100 right from the start (preferably at the same time) to get the most out of it, enjoy it to the fullest, and not get unreasonably frustrated by making your own lattes and mochas.3. The other things you REALLY should order at the same time (and all are available on Amazon) are:a. ($29) 100-pack disposable 20oz. cups with lids and sleeves (sold by Yes!fresh). Trust me, you want to get these. It's only $0.29 per cup and are far more convenient that trying to clean out a million dirty coffee cups from your car/office each week. These are worth twice what they cost in the long run. And when your friends are over, you need not 'loan' them a nice coffee cup to go (which you may never see again) - just give them a paper cup to take with them.b. ($5-15 for 25 oz. / $20-30 for 64 oz.) Torani syrups and sauces, AND the pump tops that go with them (always sold separately). IF you drink the same thing on a regular basis (like I do) such as a white chocolate peppermint mocha, buy the 64 oz. white chocolate sauce and not the smaller 25 oz. bottle.c. ($14) Amazon Basics Cotton Washcloth - 24 pack - grey (the grey matches the espresso machine, but the color doesn't matter). Again, trust me, you want a nicely folded stack of these sitting next to the machine - you will use 1 each time you make espresso, and then it will be dirty and needs to be washed. At my house (3 people using the machine) we bought two 24-packs because we make so much coffee - two 24-packs is not too many for our house (I'm thinking about buying a third pack).d. ($10 for pair of single shot size, $15 for pair of double shot size) Set of double-walled espresso shot glasses. Do NOT buy the rounded ones (ie: Cutehom espresso coffee cups) because they will not pour very well and drip all over the place (down the side) each time - very frustrating. Buy the JoyJolt Javaah Double Walled Espresso Glasses instead - you'll be glad you did in the long run. And, if you're planning to make mostly double-shot lattes/mochas, buy a set of Dragon Glassware 6 oz Espresso Cups (also double-walled) so that you don't have to keep fidgeting with the single shot cups to keep them in the right spot under the coffee dispenser. It's important to buy double-walled glasses for two reasons. First, it keeps the espresso hot while you're steaming your milk, second, it keeps you from burning your fingers when pouring the espresso into your coffee cup.e. ($15) Breville BCB100 Barista-Style Coffee Knock Box. Again, TRUST me, you want this right next to your machine - the coffee grounds will start piling up quickly and you don't want your portafilter anywhere near a garbage can. This thing is a must.4. Space requirements: This machine (and all that you want to go with it) will take some counter space - allow AT LEAST 34-inches of counter width to accommodate - slightly more is even better. You will from my picture, this is a 34-inch setup, and there is no room to spare.5. Making espresso. After you read the instructions, here are some tips that they don't include to help avoid frustration:a. When the beans are grinding, lightly knock on the top of the hopper lid (just like knocking on a door) so that the beans keep feeding down to the grinder (sometimes they get hung up - a light knock each time keeps this from happening). Do NOT overfill the portafilter (after tamping) or it will jam coffee grounds into the water outlet and could possibly damage the portafilter or locking guide. After the grounds are tamped down in the filter cup, the silver part of the tamper should be just hidden beneath the rim of the portafilter (the machine includes a tool you can use if you accidentally overfill the filter cup, but after a short while, you'll figure out how much to grind each time and the tool will not be necessary).b. You ALWAYS want to watch the pressure gauge when making espresso. It NEEDS to be in the dark grey area of the pressure gauge (and ideally in/near the middle of the grey area) during the brew cycle, otherwise you are not making good espresso - rather, you are making either watered down espresso (not enough pressure) or not enough espresso which is too rich (too much pressure). There are two key things that affect pressure: the fineness at which the coffee is ground (which is adjustable) and the volume of grounds in the portafilter (also adjustable). Although there is a one or two shot size setting, I have found it best to do two, 1-shot grinds, tamping down the grounds in-between each single-shot grind. I have the grind (volume) setting on the 4th click setting, and I have the grind (fineness) setting on either 2 or 3 (play around and see what gives you the best results). IF the pressure is too low, then either your coffee is ground too coarsely, or your have not tamped it down tight enough, or the filter is not filled with enough coffee grounds, or a combination of any/all of these things. IF the pressure is too high, then either your coffee is ground too finely, or you have tamped down the grounds too hard (tightly), or a combination of the two.c. IF using two, single-shot espresso glasses to collect a double-shot brew, keep an eye on them during the brew cycle and make sure they are centered under the espresso being dispensed (this can be avoided by using a double-shot size collection cup).d. IF making a mocha or other syrup/sauce drink, pre-mix the espresso and syrup in the glass and stir thoroughly before adding the steamed milk.e. Steaming milk is 1/2-art, and 1/2-science (seriously), and it does not come naturally. If you've never worked at a coffee shop and been trained to steam milk, do yourself a favor and watch a few good (short) YouTube videos on the proper way to steam milk. You will THANK yourself for taking 5-10 minutes on You Tube and learning the proper way to steam milk (and things to avoid). Understanding the steaming process will allow you to control the amount of foam on top and not make big mess.f. Before you steam your milk, VENT the steam wand to remove the residual water from the boiler line (you don't want a few teaspoons of water in your milk). Vent the line, then turn the steam off ... wait 5 full seconds ... then insert the steam wand into the milk, then turn the steam back on. Hold the handle with your left hand, and place your right hand underneath the stainless steel milk steaming cup, when the cup is too hot for your right hand to touch (I mean really to hot to hold), keep the steam wand in and start counting along with the pump (which sounds like a metronome in the background ... dit ... dit ... dit ... dit ...). For a semi-hot latte/mocha keep the steam wand in the milk for 30 double-dits (don't start counting until after you can non longer touch the bottom with your right hand ... ""and-one, and two, and three"" and so on until you get to 30 (the equivalent of 60 single dits). For hot (but still drinkable) count to 40 double-dits, and for very-hot, 50 double-dits. Anything above 60 and you risk burning the milk (which will ruin the flavor and you will need to toss it out and start over). When finished, turn the steam off, and remove the steam wand from the milk about 3-5 seconds before it finishes blowing steam (to avoid having milk sucked back up into the steam line).g. After you steam your milk, VENT the steam wand again to remove any milk that inadvertently got sucked up into the steam wand line and prevent any from making its way into the boiler. IF milk makes its way back into the boiler unit (because you failed to vent the line after use) you will DESTROY the boiler (permanently), in that, the milk cannot be cleaned out, will burn during the next use, and every cup of milk you steam in the future will have a burnt-milk smell/flavor - yuck! DO yourself a favor and vent the steam line religiously after each use - and make sure others who use your machine know that they can ruin it if they don't do so also! (there goes $500!)h. The bottom tray is easy to remove, empty and clean (comes apart in 3 pieces). You should empty this every 2-4 days of use because it fills up despite you not pouring liquid into it - reason is, each time you finish using the steam wand or hot water dispenser, the machine auto-vents out the line from the boiler into the bottom tray (sneaky little devil) ... so even though you don't realize it, it's filling up a little with each use. (Fun fact - the hot water dispenser can be used for instant hot water to make tea!).

It NEEDS to be in the dark grey area of the pressure gauge (and ideally in/near the middle of the grey area) during the brew cycle, otherwise you are not making good espresso - rather, you are making either watered down espresso (not enough pressure) or not enough espresso which is too rich (too much pressure). There are two key things that affect pressure: the fineness at which the coffee is ground (which is adjustable) and the volume of grounds in the portafilter (also adjustable). Although there is a one or two shot size setting, I have found it best to do two, 1-shot grinds, tamping down the grounds in-between each single-shot grind. I have the grind (volume) setting on the 4th click setting, and I have the grind (fineness) setting on either 2 or 3 (play around and see what gives you the best results). IF the pressure is too low, then either your coffee is ground too coarsely, or your have not tamped it down tight enough, or the filter is not filled with enough coffee grounds, or a combination of any/all of these things. IF the pressure is too high, then either your coffee is ground too finely, or you have tamped down the grounds too hard (tightly), or a combination of the two.c. IF using two, single-shot espresso glasses to collect a double-shot brew, keep an eye on them during the brew cycle and make sure they are centered under the espresso being dispensed (this can be avoided by using a double-shot size collection cup).d. IF making a mocha or other syrup/sauce drink, pre-mix the espresso and syrup in the glass and stir thoroughly before adding the steamed milk.e. Steaming milk is 1/2-art, and 1/2-science (seriously), and it does not come naturally. If you've never worked at a coffee shop and been trained to steam milk, do yourself a favor and watch a few good (short) YouTube videos on the proper way to steam milk. You will THANK yourself for taking 5-10 minutes on You Tube and learning the proper way to steam milk (and things to avoid). Understanding the steaming process will allow you to control the amount of foam on top and not make big mess.f. Before you steam your milk, VENT the steam wand to remove the residual water from the boiler line (you don't want a few teaspoons of water in your milk). Vent the line, then turn the steam off ... wait 5 full seconds ... then insert the steam wand into the milk, then turn the steam back on. Hold the handle with your left hand, and place your right hand underneath the stainless steel milk steaming cup, when the cup is too hot for your right hand to touch (I mean really to hot to hold), keep the steam wand in and start counting along with the pump (which sounds like a metronome in the background ... dit ... dit ... dit ... dit ...). For a semi-hot latte/mocha keep the steam wand in the milk for 30 double-dits (don't start counting until after you can non longer touch the bottom with your right hand ... ""and-one, and two, and three"" and so on until you get to 30 (the equivalent of 60 single dits). For hot (but still drinkable) count to 40 double-dits, and for very-hot, 50 double-dits. Anything above 60 and you risk burning the milk (which will ruin the flavor and you will need to toss it out and start over). When finished, turn the steam off, and remove the steam wand from the milk about 3-5 seconds before it finishes blowing steam (to avoid having milk sucked back up into the steam line).g. After you steam your milk, VENT the steam wand again to remove any milk that inadvertently got sucked up into the steam wand line and prevent any from making its way into the boiler. IF milk makes its way back into the boiler unit (because you failed to vent the line after use) you will DESTROY the boiler (permanently), in that, the milk cannot be cleaned out, will burn during the next use, and every cup of milk you steam in the future will have a burnt-milk smell/flavor - yuck! DO yourself a favor and vent the steam line religiously after each use - and make sure others who use your machine know that they can ruin it if they don't do so also! (there goes $500!)h. The bottom tray is easy to remove, empty and clean (comes apart in 3 pieces). You should empty this every 2-4 days of use because it fills up despite you not pouring liquid into it - reason is, each time you finish using the steam wand or hot water dispenser, the machine auto-vents out the line from the boiler into the bottom tray (sneaky little devil) ... so even though you don't realize it, it's filling up a little with each use. (Fun fact - the hot water dispenser can be used for instant hot water to make tea!).

Great espresso machine with built-in grinder for the money.
Reviewed in Canada on August 21, 2019Colour Name: Brushed Stainless SteelVerified Purchase
I've had this almost two years now, so I figured it was time for a proper review.If you don't want to read my in depth review but just my quick opinion and are in the market for a semi-automatic espresso maker (with grinder!), you can't beat this machine for the money it costs (especially here compared to a department store).  It comes with a satisfactory grinder (anything better itself will cost you hundreds of dollars on its own), and an easy to use (and learn) espresso maker which makes good espresso, latte's, etc. (assuming you don't use garbage beans of course).  Its been nearly two years and I've yet to have a problem and still works just as good as it did the day I got it.I'll start with the cons, because there aren't many and they are very minor, picky issues.The grinder: I find the size setting to be slightly misleading.  I'd assume you could use the full range of grind sizes, but anything less than a 4 you'll have trouble pulling a shot with the proper pressure.  Over time I've found I've needed to reduce the grind size more and more, but that could be to poor (lack of) regular cleaning habits because I'm lazy.The pressure gauge.  There's an ""espresso range"" on it which you may think anywhere in that is OK.  Its not.  To get a good pull you'll need to make sure it starts around at least ""12:30"" and ideally about ""1:00"" if you treat it like a clock (pointing straight up would be 12:00).  Once you get a feel for the grind and how much tamp pressure to use, you'll be able to do this with regular ease after a couple weeks of use (assuming you mainly stick with one type of espresso).The port-a-filter.  Its not standard sized so it may be hard to replace.  No big deal.  Those interested in this probably have more ""professional"" machines anyways and aren't in the market for this.Now onto the good things:If you've never used a steam wand before, this is probably a good machine for you.  Enthusiasts may say its not good or powerful enough, but its great to learn on.  Its not a ""double boiler"" machine where you can froth milk and do the espresso at the same time, but for starter home use its great.  Those double boiler machines start at 2-3 times the price of this.  If you only make lattes for yourself a couple times a day (like me), its perfect.  Because its doesn't use a boiler, its a little slower.  That actually makes it EASIER to make perfect milk for the novice (also like me!).  By the time I'm done making a latte, I've probably spent about 3 minutes.  That's about 6 minutes out of my day which is quicker than waiting forever at st*rb*cks for something worse.The grinder: Its built in.  Enough said.  Clean it out once in a while and you'll be fine.Making espresso:  You can adjust the temperature within 4 degrees of 200f (the factory setting).  Adjust according to your taste and beans you are using (I'm not an expert, there's a ton and probably too much info out there on the subject).  I keep mine at 202 as it brings out slightly better flavor for the standard bean I use.  If you're using relatively fresh coffee beans, you shouldn't have much trouble pulling a decent shot.Maintenance/cleaning: its easy to use the cleaning cycle.  Don't buy the cleaning tabs or descaling solutions.  Buy Cafiza tabs as they will cost you a fraction of what the Breville ones cost for regular cleaning.  Dezcal can be bought for descaling also with the same cost difference.  The drip tray is dishwasher safe (top shelf).  I put mine in about every two weeks.  In between that, I give it a good rinse when the tray is full to get rid of any grime that may have built up.If I get 2 more years out of this, I'll be extremely happy.  I've already gotten back my return on investment.

Reviewed in Canada on January 12, 2024Verified Purchase
I bought this back in 2018 and I still use it, every day sometimes multiple times a day. What a great product. Easy to use, lots of videos on it online. Really simple instructions and cleaning as well. I've considered upgrading but honestly there's no need. My coffee tastes great every morning. Also I like this steam wand better than the barista pro ones. It takes longer but I can get that consistency I want much better than the pro. That one steams it way too fast and makes my coffee way too hot. I recommend this to everyone trying to elevate their coffee game but not drop so much cash.

Amazing espresso machine
Reviewed in Canada on December 11, 2023Colour Name: Brushed Stainless SteelVerified Purchase
I bought this machine because it was rated as the #1 home espresso maker for 2023. It is heavy and high quality. The beans are grinded and put into the stainless steel portafilter automatically. It has settings to change the size of grind and the amount it dispenses. The tamper is magnetic and easily hidden when not used. It also has a hidden tool tray to store extra filter baskets and the razor trim tool. Comes with a stainless steel milk jug too.The technique of frothing the milk takes some time to perfect and watching a few YouTube videos will help if you've never done it before. I'd recommend getting a small espresso glass mug as most larger mugs don't fit under the portafilter.Overall it is an expensive machine but worth the investment if you are serious about creating high quality espresso shots, lattes, etc. The taste is very on par with cafes using high end machines.I will update this review if the machine breaks, so if there is no update it is still going strong since Dec 2023.

Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best-selling and highest rated games currently out. This game has gotten millions of people excited, overwhelmed, and blown away by the amazing experience it offers. The franchise of Grand Theft Auto has come a long way and has certainly earned the title of ""best video game franchise"". Throughout many hours of exploring the beautiful, vast, and very diverse city of Los Santos, I was completely overwhelmed by the quality and immense work put into the level design, structure, and storyline of the game.The online multiplayer experience known as ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" was also another great milestone in the development of the franchise. Grand Theft Auto Online offers even more fun and excitement in the game and truly sets a very different experience from the story mode. Grand Theft Auto Online contains a wide variety of character customization options, weapons, clothes, and a lot more. There is also a wide variety of structured game modes known as jobs which you can play to gain cash, job points, and rank up.Overall, I am very excited to own a copy of this game and I am very thrilled for upcoming changes and updates to the game. Grand Theft Auto V has truly gone above and beyond my expectations of a very good open-world video game and has definitely earned a place in my top 5 favourite video games.

What can I say about GTA5 that hasnt been said?Countless hours of entertainment, yeah thats been said.Immense open world with stunning environment and graphics? Been beaten to death.Huge collection of vehicles, mods, and places to go? YepSo what can I say about GTA5 that hasnt really been said. Nothing I'm sure, but If you want one mans opinion, this is one of the greatest video games that has ever been made. The open world application of GTA5 is unlike any game i've ever played. Want to do something? Do it, you might be suprised the outcome.How many video games have you played, where the strangers you meet or the actions you take can effect everything from your gaming experience all the way to the in game economy and stock market. Not many, I can assure you, GTA5 gives you a sandbox for even the most extreme players.With litteraly hundreds of difffernt things to do besides actualy play the story, this game threatens your To-Do list, almost seeming to make days pass faster than ever before. A person can litteraly spend hours following people, listening to their dialogue, watching them carry out their daily lives, in the midst of a very lifelike, bussling Los Santos. Hunting, racing, flying, robbing, killing, gambling, golfing, the list goes on.GTA5 isn't just a game, its an experience. If you want to live fast, drive faster and cause some serious mayhem, buy this game. Buy it twice, you might wear out the first one.

Improving a lot from the last one, GTA V has such great characters and great setups, that it becomes the best action/heist movie you could wish for. The possibility to switch for any of the three protagonists anytime you want, even in action scenes, is the best idea an action game had so far.Also, the fighting mechanics are improved a lot over GTA IV, and the incredible city feels real all around, with plenty to do aside the main story (even delivering strangers to a secret cannibals sect)!!!But the funniest part is still to steal a car and drive as fast as you can through the traffic to escape the cops, and blast choppers...

Well Worth the Wait
Reviewed in Canada on March 19, 2014Verified Purchase
From the moment the game was announced I was excited. Seeing the trailers and reading the news I felt this game was going to be a huge hit. I like to wait for games to go on sale or price drop to around $30 before I buy them but this is a game I had to get right away. Was it ever worth the price. I tear it open; pop it in the PS3 and was immediately like ""WOW"". The amount of detail is incredible and it's everywhere. Walk down an ally you see some trash, a broken bike and more. All the little details tie in to give this game a real feeling that you are in this big city.Of coarse with any game the story can be a deal breaker. Rockstar has put together a great story featuring 3 main characters. I won't go into detail about it. The story does seem short after you have completed it but my guess is there were complaints with the length of GTA 4's story.I have not gotten very far in Multiplayer but it is a fun way I find to kill time.

Got an XLR mic you need to connect to a pre amp/mixer? This is going to get the job done. There are zero complaints on the other end of the mic about the sound i'm getting, which means this cable is doing its job absolutely perfectly. The highest praise you can give a cable is that you forget it even exists because it causes no issues, and does the job it was made to do, that's this cable. Ive clocked in at least 28 hours by now with a hot mic in discord, using this to connect to a U-PHORIA UM2. Been told i sound like a radio show. Cant recommend this enough.

before buying this Amazon Cube Ive used a Shield and still have and use an Apple TV. I have been pleasantly surprised and how fast it is and at its picture quality. i used it in our upstairs bedroom via wifi and the Apple with our main TV wired. It loads both Netflix and Prime noticeably faster than the Apple TV. i do prefer the remote for the Apple TV over the Cubes but i really the Alexa integration and voice commands of the Cube. For the price its hard to beat and Amazon has done a good job over the years with the Fire TV products. Would recommend this product

Huge upgrade from Firestick 4K.
Reviewed in Canada on October 16, 2023Configuration: Fire TV CubeVerified Purchase
I am pretty nestled into the Amazon ecosystem. Previously I had a Firestick 4K. But over the past few months I noticed that it was getting very very slow and sometimes would crash. This is because the firestick 4K is getting pretty old now. So I ordered the fire Cube third gen and I am super happy with it. There is absolutely no lag in the UI or loading of high resolution video at all. Everything is really snappy and super fast. Content loads almost instantly. And the difference between the fire stick 4K and the fire Cube third gen is night and day. It is an absolutely beautiful design and it pairs really really well with my Echo Studio. In home theater mode the sound quality is absolutely mind blowing especially where Dolby Atmos content is applicable. Amazon did such a good job when they designed this new generation fire Cube. It has a USB port and an ethernet port. Although because this fire Cube has Wi-Fi 6E it is much much quicker internet through Wi-Fi over the ethernet which only supports up to 100mb/s speed. While over Wi-Fi 6 I was getting up to 400mb/s download. So in this case using Wi-Fi 6 is much faster than using the ethernet port. For anyone looking to upgrade from just the regular fire stick 4K it is definitely worth it. I can't speak for the 4K Maxx because I never owned that one. But I would imagine that it's still a huge upgrade. The fire cube is so much quicker than the fire stick. And it was a pleasant surprise. And the HDMI pass through that Amazon added on this generation is absolutely amazing and this was one of the best ideas that they have done yet. I love being able to pass through video from my Xbox or my gaming PC. It is so handy

Reviewed in Canada on February 2, 2024Configuration: Fire TV CubeVerified Purchase
Bought a new TV and couldn't stand the speed of the integrated apps. This works much better, and makes switching between apps and using the device so pleasant. I decided to go for the cube since I didn't already have an Alexa device in my room, and I love the voice commands. I'm able to control all my devices using it. Easily control the power and volume of the TV, quickly search for anything you'd like to watch, control other smart home devices, etc. There is a lot of ads on the home screen, but it is still a much nicer experience than the built in smart tv apps that most TVs come with. Worth getting one even if you have a smart TV.

I love that you have a HDMI and USB input and now my use hard drive is attached to it to play media files.  It supports NTFS!  It's worth the price diff over the Firestick 4K max.

Now the bar has no issue with audio in any app. The soundbar is doing the work it was designed to do. The video enhancer is very good. The set up was a little bit of a battle but in the end I can now easily switch to my live tv using the input option in the cube. It improved my TELUS tv box sound quality, fixed an audio sync issue and picture quality is enhanced. So much better for me and faster than the Samsung tv built in apps

New Generation is GARBAGE
Reviewed in Canada on September 16, 2023Configuration: Fire TV CubeVerified Purchase
I have 2 of the previous generation and they are wonderful. I bought this new one for my new Fire TV, which on its own does not need a cube or anything;  I bought the cube for 1 reason and 1 reason only; so that I can issue voice commands without having to locate the remote and press and stupid little button.Well, on this generation, the voice command capabilities are completely unreliable! Many times does not even here me speak, others it hears me, acknowledges my instructions, says ok, but then does nothing. THIS IS COMPLETELY USELESS TO ME!Well, I did what support asked, did a total reset of the box, hours of work to reconfigure all my streaming content. I even replaced the wireless with a wired one hoping that would fix ;it. NOTHIMG WORKS. IT IS COMPLETELTY UNREIALBLE. I ask Alexa do something, it does one of 3 things:1. Does not even acknowledge me2. Says, okay as if it is going to do it, and then does nothing3. Says, I don't know how to do that, when it was something I have asked to to do before many times over the last 4 years.Amazon, needs to got back and do a COMPLETE review of the server software, as it has become completely unreliable. I will not buy, nor promote this product to anyone again. In fact, I will advise anyone that ask, not to buy! I will look at Google Cast and if they have a more reliable product!

I ordered this sunscreen for my 1 year old grandson. It was the one for babies. Instead I got the regular Thinkbaby. Still it was okay. There were two tubes in the bag. Then I decided I would order it for myself. When it arrived, there was a hole in the bag and only one tube. Somebody took one out. Not happy about that at all. As far as the sunscreen goes, it goes on nice. It's not white and it sinks in nicely. It has a very mild coconut scent. I like it. It's just too bad this has happened. Don't think I will order it again unless it can be fixed. Mistakes do happen.

The best natural sunscreen I have found!
Reviewed in Canada on May 24, 2019Verified Purchase
I am a shade of white that is rarely found amongst the living... and I have tried EVERY natural sunscreen out there. They either smell like peanut butter and are sticky = great for collecting bugs, or they are completely useless and I burn a shade of red that hurts for days and days and days and days. But this stuff is SOOOOOOOOOOOO amazing! It smells amazing, it works great, it does not leave a gross after trail! It is the BEST NATURAL SUNSCREEN I HAVE EVER FOUND! Are there down sides? Sure, it costs a little more than I like and it is a little thicker than I would hope for... in an ideal world! But the fact is, there isn't going to be a natural sunscreen that works the same as the chemical ones. That is what makes the other ones so alluring. Is it worth the extra money? YES. I will be buying it again. Does it really matter that it goes on a little thick? NO, in literally 30 seconds it has been absorbed and you won't even remember. BUY THIS SUNSCREEN if you are Irish-white and want to outlive your relatives.

It spreads easily, isn't greasy or strong smelling, and washes off easily...not to mention it's safer then a lot of other brands. After one day, our day care provider even asked where I got it because she thought it was so great and you can imagine how many different breands she's had to apply!Go for it, it's worth a few extra dollars :)

Brings me back to my childhood. Love it
Reviewed in Canada on January 6, 2021Verified Purchase
Console gaming has come a long way from the original days of Nintendo and Super Nintendo. We now have console systems that can fetch over $1000 such as the #playstation 5. Thinking back to my childhood I remember my dad renting our first Nintendo system (we did not have tons of money to buy one). I remember setting it up for the first time as a 7 or 8-year-old. I can still remember the feeling of turning it on and listening to the sounds of the Super Mario music.Fast forward almost 25-30 years we now have the opportunity to relive those moments with our children. I and my wife limit our children to a certain amount of screentime a day but we still wanted to offer them the enjoyment that does come with playing video games. At the same time, we wanted value and what's better than something that brought us enjoyment as children.Nintendo released a retro classic console a few years ago. When it was first released I'm pretty sure you could pick it up for around $60 dollars and it pretty much sold out. Now you will find it for sale around the $300 dollar mark. Does that mean it's not worth it? I don't think so, and that's the reason this Christmas I purchased it for my kids.If you do searching for this retro system you will find many clones for cheaper but I wanted the authentic version from Nintendo that came with the 20+ most popular games such as donkey kong, Mario Brothers, Zelda, Contra, and so on.When it arrived I am not exactly sure what I was expecting but when I opened it a smile came over my face. It was a bit smaller than the original version but it looked the same down to the controllers. The one thing I did read in previous reviews is the controller cables were not that long so I opened to buy extension cables which I highly suggest. Gone are the days you need to sit 4 feet away from the TV, these extensions give you a good 10-foot reach.Installation was simple and easy and only requires a single HDMI cord from the console to the TV.Once I booted it up I saw a screen giving me 20+ options of games I played in my youth. To my surprise, the graphics had not been updated at all so it took a little bit to realize the grainy screen was the way it was ""supposed"" to be. Hours into playing (me and my wife) we were reliving our childhood once again... I could not forget that this was a gift for my kids though:)Once XMAS came around the kids were more than happy. They have been enjoying it for the last 2 weeks and now the music I came to love annoyed me haha. None the less great purchase :)

All the games look better than ever and they work perfectly. Love the game selection, only a few I would have swapped out for others but i don't really care to be honest. Make sure you buy the controller extension cord (10$) because the original ones are way too short. BTW you can plug the usb cable directly to your tv so the ""missing"" power supply is not an issue.

Now I do know that these games aren't like today's games, but my son of almost 7 years old - loved them.Jumped right in - took 3 seconds to figure out what's what and we lost him for a couple of hours.What's nice is I realize now that these games taught patience, each person taking their turns, encouraging the other, healthy competition etc. The best part is I know the games! I can play with my son instead of trying to play solo style along side my kid. It's a fun little trip back in time and a simple system.

This game is worth the purchase of a Wii U. It's inventive, beautiful and completely addictive. You'll be jonesing to collect every green star and hidden stamp. Not only that, but it has one of the best soundtracks ever. The cat suit, double cherry, and boomerang suit are really great additions to your arsenal. The controls are precise and intuitive - especially with a pro controller. Others have pointed out how it doesn't quite reach the superb heights of Super Mario World or Galaxy, but for me, it falls in among the best the franchise has ever offered. Pick this up!

Really great addition to the Super Mario franchise, the new catsuit its entertaining and makes you search the entire level for anything hidden. 3D levels instead of standard platform seems much better to me,only thing i never liked about most mario games is time limit. Hope they do a Super Mario 64 type game in the future (not Galaxy). Comparing to other Mario games tho this one is fantastic, 4 players, all have different styles of movement/perks.

What an absolutely fantastic game!
Reviewed in Canada on February 13, 2014Verified Purchase
Bought this to play with my SO in our free time. At first I felt like it was a bit gimmicky, introducing the various game concepts in the first bit of levels to lay the ground for the later worlds. But each level throughout the entire game is unique and well designed around its own elements; you typically don't see repeats of the levels concepts until much later in the game in challenge levels. A great game for both the skilled and the new, had both of us laughing and dying.

We were sold a defective game
Reviewed in Canada on May 2, 2020Verified Purchase
This product arrived today, just on time for our son’s birthday. Unfortunately it was damaged. The game has clear blemishes that go all the way through. We could see about 9 marks on it before we even took it out of the package. The cut scene works, but the actual game does not. It freezes. This was purchased for our 6 year old son for his birthday. We cannot give it to him now because it is defective. Since Wii u games are no longer available brand new, we must purchase them used, and count on the honesty of the people who are selling them.  I would like a refund, please.

Rather Fun
Reviewed in Canada on May 14, 2014Verified Purchase
I bought a Wii U, and this was the first game I bought for it, I am not disappointed.Its really quite fun, maybe not worth full price ($70ca~ at time of writing) but for $50 after shipping and what not good deal.The game plays really well, feels good as well.Pretty fun, runs at a smooth 60fps at 1080p (but the lack of AA is a bit annoying)over all fun game, runs well, well worth the money.

Okay quality. We do get frequent errors to check the disc, which interrupts play. So far, taking the disc out and re-inserting gets it working.

This game is 110% for humans of ALL AGES. Just the last three worlds are kind of hard. Wow, amazing time. Arrived a day before estimate, brand NEW SEALED product. It's original and the Club Nintendo code was brand new and worked.I would recommend this to anybody who has a Wii U or gifting to someone with a Wii U.P.S: The back of the CD is actually like a mirror and really soft when grappling it from the sides :)

This is now my second FireHD10 Tablet. My first was the 2019 variant and I already felt that was a fantastic value for money. Before I continue, I will preface this by saying this review may get a little long, but I really feel that many things about Amazon Fire products need clarification as there is just so much misinformation and even outright falsehoods dished out about them.. even from some “Reviewers” on this very page. I hope I can provide some beneficial points for anyone taking their time to go through this. Ok, lets begin...I hate to admit that I am a former Apple fanboy and I cannot stress how much I have come to rely on all of my new Amazon Fire & Smart Products. My first trial experience was picking up a FireHD8 along with a regular FireTV Stick when on sale during the July 2019 Canada Prime Day. Now, I have an additional 3 additional FireTV Sticks (4K versions), a Fire Cube, Echo Show 8,Echo Show 5, this brand new HD10 64GB 2021 variant along with my original HD10 and still growing! I could go on forever about all of my new hardware but the bottom line is that all of these Amazon Fire and smart products are an outstanding value in relation to competing products and can literally save you $1,000's over Apple products!!. If I were running multiple iPads and Apple hardware in my home in an attempt to try to recreate what I get out of my Amazon product ecosystem the cost would be more than what I have spent on Amazon gear by a factor of 7! This is no exaggeration.This newer HD10 really feels a lot “snappier” than my current 10inch and I already thought that was a great tablet. To me, the responses when using the newer HD10 are lightning quick. This of course is due in part to the newer model having an additional 1GB of memory bringing the total to 3GB vs. 2GB in the prior generation. Also, you can now add a whopping 1TB of additional internal Storage via use of your own optional microSD cards. Previously, this was 500GB in prior versions. The newer HD10 also has a slightly smaller footprint than previous with a thinner frame bezel all around the display screen. I like this touch very much.Another very welcome change is the shifting of the internal front facing camera to the upper center of the unit from its previous side position. During the age of Global Pandemics and so many of us now working remotely and “zooming” for multiple hours daily, this simple little change makes teleconferencing so much easier and more natural. You are no longer having to twist and contort getting yourself properly framed for a call. A very welcome change indeed.Also of note is the newer version has BlueTooth 5.0 vs. 4.2 in the 2019 variant and the rear camera has also now been bumped up to a 5 Megapixel unit from the prior 2 Megapixel one. Admittedly though, Fire HD’s have never had a particularly good internal camera but that may be completely irrelevent to many.If you are a Prime Member (and honestly if you regulary use Amazon how wouldn’t you be at this point at only $79 annually?) you cannot go wrong with any of these items as they are of course optimized for consuming Prime Video, Amazon Music and Prime Reading and will get you into Smart Home control and camera usage with minimal effort.As with prior thoughts on my previous HD8 and HD10, my only real gripe with Fire Tablets is that they don’t have GPS embedded, so they are therefore NOT suited for standalone external satellite navigation use...but I got over that! These are best suited for use within your home environment or taking on trips once you have locally downloaded all of the video, music and reading content to satisfy yourself or the wee ones while away. ((Unlike iPads, remember that you have a microSD slot on Fire Tabs allowing you to add up to 1TB of your own additional internal storage!))All in all, these are amazing pieces of hardware to satisfy the media consumption needs for your whole family. And, they make fantastic choices for giving to children for their “kids needs” because they are simple to operate, are relatively SAFE due to the ease at which you can set Parental controls and their buy-in costs relative to competing products is such that if your kids somehow manage to smash them.. and you know they eventually just might.. cuz...KIDS!,you are not going to cry too much about it. Now,try to say that about a $400 or $500 iPad!And now to a question that is on many a mind and the one relating to the most misinformation about these products...for all those who think these are “too restrictive” and wont let me do this or that... ""waaaaaah... waaaaaah... waaaaah.."", just take a close look at some of the app icon’s showing in my attached screenshot pics. It IS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE to unlock the Google Play Store with minimal effort! I included a shot of the screen image after applying the Google PlayStore on my newly unpacked Fire10 and just prior to starting to add Google store applications. Among other things I have been able to add Bell FibeTV,KODI, the official YouTube app, Ebay, Firefox, Home Automation apps, Microsoft productivity apps, Google apps and on and on. I have always been able to do this to ALL of my previous Fire Tabs as well. The ability to do this has always been available to you unlike what many out there try to claim.

Just remember that you CAN add the Google Play Store in future if you choose to...

A great mid level tablet, but…
Reviewed in Canada on June 19, 2021Digital Storage Capacity: 64 GBConfiguration: Without Special OffersColour Name: BlackStyle: Fire HD 10Verified Purchase
Look  here’s the deal.. I’ve gone through IPads, cheap Chinese Android tablets, and now this Amazon Fire HD 10 64GB model. I’ve been through them all, all of my IPads are outdated and getting old. I also don’t feel like spending a $1000 bucks for a new iPad. So, not long ago I picked up a fire stick for my mother and was pretty impressed with the stick, so I decided to pick up this tablet. Because I got used to the Firestick, I felt right at home with the tablet given the Amazon ecosystem.I now have everything in this, including the Google play store, as well as Kodi, and many other APK programs as well that allow me to watch many great tv shows and movies. The picture quality is exceptional, the sound is terrific, and the battery is not half bad, I wish it could last just a tad longer, but I’m nitpicking.  The only thing I need for it now is a case, and then I should be good for quite a while.This is what I’ll say for others sitting in the fence. If you’re an Apple user you probably won’t like this ecosystem, however, if you have the ability and know how to install or side load apps, you’ll appreciate what this tablet has to offer, and it gives you more options than Apple IPads due to their closed operating system. I can also install an additional memory card in this tablet for memory beyond the 64GB’s if I ever want to. This tablet is capable of running the Google play store and any of the apps that you can get on there also, in the end this is running on an Android 9.0 Pie operating system, so it is android friendly.I think where people start to get disappointed is if they don’t understand how to side load apps or tinker with the tablet to customize it to their needs and wants. However, this is nothing a few YouTube videos can’t teach you, it’s not hard at all. I legit did my research before buying this tablet and it scored higher than Lenovo and many other cheaper and slightly more expensive tablet competitors.It’s a mid range tablet that to me gives you a serious bang for your buck. Also, keep in mind here too that you also have the option to do a payment plan, which is pretty much unheard of this day and age. So I paid $70 bucks on delivery and for the next 5 months I pay 48 bucks, that’s pretty cheap and basically monthly coffee money.Also, for parents reading this review, this is an excellent option for children and offers a safety parental mode for kids so they don’t get into any bad stuff. I’d strongly suggest getting the 64GB model so that you will be less handcuffed in regards to what you want to do with this tablet.With Apples skyrocketing prices and our economy in the crapper, this is a financially healthy substitute for some really cool entertainment as a tablet.P.S the photo I added to my comment shows the size of this thing, it’s night and day bigger than the others. I’ve read the negative reviews and the really bad ones are clearly from people expecting $1000 dollar high level tablet specs for $200 bucks, it’s just not going to ever happen and you can never please those people. It’s a great bang for your buck tablet.

Reviewed in Canada on March 14, 2024Size: 6 FeetColour Name: BlackNumber of Items: 2Verified Purchase
The black Anker cables match the colour of the Anker charger and the black separates the charger and cable from the other white cables in the outlet.  Cable is durable and does not tangle.  Great at charging cable and charger combo which efficiently charge my iPhone.  Hard to beat Anker quality.  I’ll be ordering more cables in white for another location.  Thank you.

Very Happy - SO FAR - with the Anker [2-Pack 6Ft] Premium Nylon USB-C to USB-A Fast Charging Cables
Reviewed in Canada on April 26, 2022Size: 6 FeetColour Name: BlackNumber of Items: 2Verified Purchase
I have only been using the Anker [2-Pack 6Ft] Premium Nylon USB-C to USB-A Fast Charging Type C cables for two weeks, but so far am very happy with them.Specifically:1. The cables fit well into my 'phone, and laptop - i.e., the cables fit snugly, and are not loose2. The cables are uniformly (i.e., all of them) the same; one is not looser than the other when plugged in to a device3. Data transfer works well - it is not incredibly fast, but the speed is adequate4. The cables are nice and thick, and are wrapped in a sturdy coating, which I find reassuring in terms of projected longevity (I would never twist, bend or kink the cable though - any cable is far more likely to fail if that happens)I bought these cables after having had to send back some INUI cables, one of which was so loose at the input to my mobile, that the connector would not stay in my 'phone, so I hope that these Anker cables continue to last and perform well.I will update this review from time-to-time.At the moment, I highly recommend these cables.

Replacement Experience and Warranty after 3 years
Reviewed in Canada on September 7, 2022Size: 6 FeetColour Name: BlackNumber of Items: 2Verified Purchase
I purchased these in July of 2019. After 3 years, one of the wires stopped providing data and began to charge very slowly. Doubtful that Anker would help, I sent them a message through their warranty portal and was connected with Alyssa. To my surprise, all they asked for was the Serial Number, proof that the cable was faulty, and a picture of a cut cable for them to send me a brand new replacement. 3 years after purchase!The actual cables themselves have been amazing, I use both of them every single day - one by my bedside and one at my desk. The one at my bedside is still going strong to this day. They're sturdy and the cabling is made of a nice braided material with a nice size on the usb c side, not too large to not fit in my phone case.

Peanut Butter is delicious!
Reviewed in Canada on March 1, 2024Flavour Name: Peanut ButterSize: 442 g (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
Not really on a fitness journey, I have tried others over the years having worked as a distributor for a couple MLM companies before. No matter what benefits there were, if I didn’t like it, I didn’t promote it or drink it because no matter the benefits I couldn’t get past the taste or texture. I really need to like it to actually drink it. So I was hesitant to try this one, recommended to me on Facebook. I reluctantly gave it a go, more so since I’ve seen recipes (besides drinking it) so I thought if anything I could use it in something else, like pancakes or something to get some extra protein. Anyways long story short, this stuff is good! No, I’m not a rep or anything for it. I just like it! It’s dairy free however I only have 2% cow milk in the house so I mixed it with that. I did 4ozs of milk and 1/2 scoop with 1/4 banana my first time. It was too sweet. I realized then that I didn’t need to hide the flavour this time (like others I’ve tried). So my second time I left out the banana and it was perfect.There is a little texture, like it’s not chalky at all however you know there is powder in it so it’s just a little bit. Nothing to stop you from drinking it. The peanut butter cup one is what I’ve tried so far. My kids also approve from the taste they both needed lol and that’s really saying something. I’d like to try another flavour, I wouldn’t want any flavour that’s sweeter than this one though. I like that you can try the smaller bag first and see if you like it.

Mocha Flavour Strong
Reviewed in Canada on March 23, 2024Verified Purchase
After reviewing several options for protein powder, I purchased this one because it is plant based, 100% natural , Non GMO, non-dairy, etc. The textured is good and it blended easily with my non-dairy beverage. I was disappointed with the flavor of the Mocha. Chocolate was not offered, so I thought Mocha would be close.  Would be great if the manufacturer offered a selection of samples sizes (one or two scoops per pouches) that one could purchases.  I have a large bag of this mocha protein that I don't like and it's not cheap. I'm expecting delivery of a small bag of the vanilla flavor in early April.  Hope it's good!

First time purchasing a Protein Powder~Salted Caramel
Reviewed in Canada on April 11, 2024Flavour Name: Salted CaramelSize: 884 g (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I was very reluctant to order this due to the high price.I really liked the flavour but found it sooo hard to mix in a Blender Bottle without chunks during every sip which was very frustrating.I also found due to packaging, that a lot of the powder was being wasted & going all over the place when I was just trying to get 1 scoop.Since it only has 884 grams, it doesn’t even last a month, especially with the product waste.I also need to mention that after drinking it, I felt so bloated and lost all energy and it caused severe constipation.I was going to try ordering it once more a couple weeks ago, but the shipping had changed to 2-3 weeks.So I have been searching other protein powders on Amazon and found that Pure Protein has 907 grams, comes in a container instead of a flimsy bag, has much higher ratings, by over 6000 reviews & is less than half the price!So now that I’m ready to re order, I’ll be trying the Pure Protein.Good Protein is just too expensive for what you actually get and the only thing I really liked was the flavour…even with all of the chunky pieces.

Double Roundhouse ""Air"" Kick, like a Ninja!  Gosh, I'm Fried!
Reviewed in Canada on November 23, 2023Style: 8 Quart 6-in-1Verified Purchase
There is much to love about the Ninja Brand of Appliances.  I thoroughly enjoy their quality and durability.This has been on my wish list for quite some time as I bought it as a gift for my Aunt and uncle last Christmas.  Since then, I have been drooling to own one.  Well, I do now and it was worth the weight and the money spent.Air Frying has taken over, and besides the energy savings from not having to heat up your oven as often, the flavor you get when air frying is also unbeatable.I own a Ninja Foodi 12-in-1 1 and it has been a great air fryer, steamer, pressure cooker, you name it.  One of my gripes was that as I use the Air Fry function far more often than any other, it was a lot to clean after each use.  It has a big inside metal bowl and an air fry insert.  The Ninja foodi weighs a lot, and I keep it in one of the corners on the counter in my kitchen.  For every use, I would have to pull it out and leave it out to cook, before cleaning and putting it back.With this machine, that is a thing of the past.  The machine itself is stationary.  No need to haul out the whole unit like before.  It lives in the same place as my Ninja Foodi and now, all I have to do it pull out one or both, depending on what I am cooking, food trays.I love that you can cook two different things at the same time, with two different temperatures and settings.  I love the smart finish technology and find that ultra-convenient for putting it in and walking away.  This machine has received a lot of use since I purchased it and overall I am thrilled to finally own one.Here is one thing to consider, which I hadn't.  With the Ninja Foodi, things cooked faster.  This makes sense to me, because it is a more powerful machine and had only one chamber.  So French Fries would take about 18 - 20 minutes depending on the cut in the Ninja Foodi.  In this machine, they take about 25 - 27 minutes.  Perhaps 24 - 26 if only cooking fries in one compartment.Other than that, I am extremely happy with this product.  I would definitely recommend the 8qt or 10 qt for families as you can fit a lot of food in there.  Also, check out the silicone liners, they help with keeping this thing spotless.

I love my Ninja air fryer Foodi XL WITH PROBE
Reviewed in Canada on March 7, 2024Style: Smart Cook ThermometerVerified Purchase
I’ve had to take over preparing meals for my elderly parents. This has been a game changer for me. I absolutely love using the temperature probe for meats. Once the preset temperature is reached the machine turns off and I just recheck it at the end. It really makes things easy. I just made my first grilled cheese in it and came out great. We love chicken and pork chops as well. Clean up is easy, no fuss. I prefer to wash the baskets by hand rather than the dishwasher. Fries come out crisp. Everything I’ve made so far has cooked really nice. I’ve cut down my oven use by half or more. My father said my air fryer chicken is the best he’s ever had. If you don’t have one you should get one. I love it. It has been one of the best investments in my kitchen.

A Thrilling Blast from the Past: Nintendo 64 Delivers!
Reviewed in Canada on November 9, 2023Verified Purchase
After a minor hiccup with my initial purchase, I am now absolutely thrilled with my Nintendo 64 System. This classic gaming console has rekindled fond memories and provided hours of nostalgic entertainment. The Nintendo 64's iconic design and unique controller brought back a rush of excitement from my earlier gaming days. Setting it up was a breeze, and I was quickly immersed in a world of beloved titles. The performance of this console is outstanding. The graphics may be retro by today's standards, but they hold a certain charm that's unmistakably Nintendo 64. Titles like Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time feel as engaging and captivating as they did years ago. The selection of available games for the Nintendo 64 is a treasure trove of classic titles that cater to a wide range of tastes. Whether it's action, adventure, racing, or platforming, this console has it all. Each game brings its own unique experience, making it a joy to explore the extensive library. The durability of the console is also worth mentioning. Despite being a pre-owned unit, it functions flawlessly and shows no signs of wear or performance issues. This is a testament to the quality and craftsmanship that Nintendo is known for. However, I did have some issues with the controller. It was clean but the center joystick is a bit difficult to use. It's a little loose.

Made the leap from 3rd party Pods to the Real Deal and I'm glad I did!
Reviewed in Canada on July 4, 2021Verified Purchase
I had previously purchased blue tooth buds from a third party company on Amazon. I mostly used them for podcast listening, so I wasn't too picky about the quality of the audio. (I grew up listening to AM radio, so I'm not the pickiest when listening to spoken audio)Still, they broke down over time (one of the buds stopped working after a while) and I was left with the decision to buy another cheapie ($30-$40) set or perhaps buy something in a higher priced category.Already having a few Apple products, I decided to get these Apple AirPods.I am 100% satisfied with this purchase for several reasons:-The quality build of the pods is really good. Smooth, with just the right amount of weight to them.-The charging case is also quality. The way the unit opens and closes is very satisfying.-The fact that the case works with a wireless charging mat is an excellent feature-The feature where the pods turn off when they detect they have left your ears is super convenient-Can be paired with Siri for voice control of some features-Excellent battery life on the Pods and on the charging caseOverall, super happy with this product. I could have easily just purchased the cheaper brand again, but they would have broken down over time. One of the major differences between these Pods and other 3rd party pods I've used is that their connection is unrivalled. I live around some tall buildings and sometimes on windy days when I was out with the 3rd party pods, the connection would get caught off. With the Apple AirPods, this is a thing of the past.I have an Iphone and when I'm in the car and about to get out, the Iphone will disconnect from my car's bluetooth, and with the AirPods still in my ears, as I walk away from my car the Pods continue playing right where I left off. It's super convenient when listening to a good audiobook or podcast that gets to a good part right as you get home. The Pods come on and continue the audio seamlessly.The audio quality is good: I mostly use mine for listening to podcasts, talking on the phone, and yes listening to music. The voices come in crisp and clear with the right amount of voice. Music listening is fine: fans of bass-y music might wish the Pods had a little more punch. But for most everyday music listening, just running errands or at the gym, this will more than suffice.I also really like that you can charge the AirPods inside the case very quickly. I forget to charge them all the time but in the mornings all I have to do is put them in the case for about 5-10 minutes and then I have about an hour or more of listening time.Something that I found interesting before making this purchase but it did not deter me: the battery inside the Pods with regular use will last about 2 years. I expect that to be the case for me, maybe even a little sooner simply because I use them all the time.  But, for me it's a fair trade-off for the quality of the product.I've had these AirPods for just over 2 months and I love them.

Great product, but not the best.
Reviewed in Canada on November 28, 2023Verified Purchase
I originally was deciding between the Air Pods and Beats Wireless Earbuds. When choosing these products, I was looking for sound quality, comfortability, and battery life.PROS:The Airbuds surprising fit well in my ear, usually the standard design of Apple ear phones dont fit my ear, but these ones werent bad. I want them to be snug for when I'm working out or on the go. I think the general public will NOT have an issue with the ear buds fitting.The Sound quality is fantastic. No issues there. Bass sounds great, too.The are very sleek design and easy to store, big plus. They can fit in your smaller-than-average pockets.The device charges quickly!CONS:I dont have many cons with the product. A couple cons that I would point out, is the fact that they dont feel as secure as I want them too, and they dont have any options for attaching a sort of arm or bracket support. When i started jogging or doing exercises, they fell out.The sound cancelling could be a bit better, buts thats also because they are not in-ear suction style ear buds. No big issue there.I found the battery life to be as expected. It had only lost about 10% battery life within a couple hours of usage. Not bad at all!Overall, I would say the product is worth the money, especially if youre tired of wires, and not particularly looking for a product that caters to athletics.

            This game is so much fun. It's better than the original board game because it can go faster but also still gives you all the same experience as playing monopoly. Played this at easter and everyone loved it.

ultra fun for  family
Reviewed in Canada on March 17, 2024Verified Purchase
This is literally the third time i bought this card game.  My family has a knack for leaving it at some cottage or losing cards .  We love this game .  It does take some time to learn it properly but its a super fun way to spend time with the family.  All my kids are finally old enough to understand it and they get super competitive and team-up/gang-up.  Brings out the ugly sides of human nature lololo but we learn, love, and get over it.

Fast to play, fun and addictive
Reviewed in Canada on February 4, 2024Verified Purchase
This game takes the essential strengths of Monopoly, removing all the tedium and most luck-based elements, and turns it into a really fast and addictive game that we often go back to.  There's a lot of choice involved and matches aren't very long.  Can be played with 2-5 players.  We really love this one and I highly recommend it, excellent value for the price.

Fun concept
Reviewed in Canada on October 14, 2021Verified Purchase
I ended up buying 2nd mold powder because like majority of everyone else I screwed up first time. The first time I followed directions to a t & powder thickened up too much. The second time I added 2 cups of water & mixed for about 15-20 seconds, then put member in tube. It worked out better. Would work better with a partner to get perfect mould, too many working parts when doing it alone from getting stimulated to mixing powder for desired time. It has to be perfect conditions to get the perfect mould. & once member hits wet cold mould it makes it hard to maintain hardness. I recommend using penis pump & penis ring.  But fun & could be a great gift.

Great screen, Great build quality, Good camera, Good battery
Reviewed in Canada on March 18, 2023Style: S23 (new)Colour Name: BlackSize: 256Verified Purchase
I’ll be comparing it with the iPhone for the most part cuz I’m in Apple’s ecosystem for quite a while. For one, the base S23 is in the same price category as iPhone 14. Yet for the same money, it does not compromise on giving you the 120hz display, triple cameras, and the same chip as the S23+ and Ultra. This makes it very attractive for me as an apple user. Now the other notable feature is that it's INCREDIBLE light, way lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro (24% lighter)  while feeling very sturdy.The screen is great, the 1080p resolution is sharp enough that it's almost impossible to tell any pixels apart. And the 120hz refresh rate is a real difference maker, it's UNACCEPTABLE for me for have 60hz at this price point anymore especially you wanna keep the devices for years to come. Samsung does not cut corners here...Performance is great day to day, but still,  the CPU not as fast as Apple's A16 chip in benchmarks. However, the GPU is quite a bit faster than the A16. And because of this, it can handle the most demanding games like Genshin Impact with very high frame rates. If you tweak it using the official game plugins, it can hit almost 60fps on the highest settings for quite a while.The cameras are great. Again, hardware wise, there's no cutting corners, you get all three cameras. Samsung does not omit the telephoto camera here. And all three cameras are of good quality and the night shots are surprisingly good.Lastly,, the battery life is pretty adequate for its size. For me, it can go for a day on a single charge. 6-7 hrs screen on time.The good:1. Samsung promises 4 years of OS updates + 1 year of security update. This is very good for any Android phones. It just seams to me that Samsung pours a lot of loves into these devices this time...2. The phantom black S23 is gorgeous. The aluminum frame has a tiny purple hint to it. But it looks premium. I'd say it looks better than the green one and the graphite one that you could only order online. (Obviously, its a different calculus to compare it against the cream and lavender colours)3. The 8 Gen 2 chip inside is one of the more efficient ones over the past few generations, it stays cool and consumes less battery on average. It's a pretty major upgrade especially considering that most chips' performance is advancing very slowly these days.4. I am a fan of flat screen design with even borders all round, this is exactly it.The bad:1. There's no charger included, but it tops out at 25w so not a big deal anyway.2. The side button is a little extra wobbly, which isn't great.3. Adding fingerprints is slow as hell sometimes, very painful to use.4. 8GB of ram. The s23 doing alright today, but if you gonna live out that 5 years of support, that could be a bottleneck in maybe 3 years time.

Sleek small phone that feels premium
Reviewed in Canada on March 20, 2024Style: S23 (new)Colour Name: LavenderSize: 256Verified Purchase
Bought this as an upgrade over my cheap but durable A13. Feels premium in comparison even though it is the ""lower end"" of the S23 range. Two days in, I find the screen is very vivid and it feels good in the hands. Just the size I wanted for a small phone. Thumbprint sensor is very conveniently located and easy to use, RAM and general processing is a very nice step up from my last phone. I bought purple because it was the cheapest colour on sale but found myself surprisingly enchanted by how nice it looked when I unpacked it, the frosted glass effect on the backing makes it feel fancier than it is. Restored the backup of all the stuff on my old phone through SmartSwitch and made a basically seamless transition. Heads up, it will not let you set it up without putting a SIM card in it, so make sure you've already got one when you're ready to start booting it up and aren't planning on acquiring one later. So far, so good!

 Samsung S23 Ultra 512gb for $1,649.99 - This phone was 48% charged out of the box and was easy to set up.  It came with the usb-C cord and the pin to eject the sim card but thats about it.  I am upgrading from my galaxy S9+ which i liked a lot and this phone is pretty much the same but better in almost every way.  I bought this mainly for the camera though and it doesn't disappoint.  As much as my s9+ had a great camera back in the year it came out , this camera is unbelievable for a phone camera.If you want a phone thats lightning fast and takes amazing pictures and videos I'd say for sure get this phone.  However I wouldn't recommend this if you have a high end phone from the last year or so like the s22 ultra .  I dont believe it would have enough of an improvement to warrant paying the cost of this phone.If your phone is 3 years or older or not a higher end phone , I'd say if you have the funds which this s23 ultra does have a very substantial price tag , this could be a good investment in the long term.

Came in excellent condition. Camera is wonderful, phone is super responsive.The only thing i did not like is the finger print reader and battery life. Majority of the times you need min. 3 attempts to unlock the phone. But if you just use face recognition it works so much better. I used to own the S9 before buying this and honestly the battery life between them is not that much different. I honestly thought it would last so much longer especially when using the camera or browsing social media. You need to charge it every 8-11 hours

The phone had a fixed coloured spot in the screen. After you're on the phone with Samsung Canada service for 45 minutes answering endless questions, restarts, cache cleans and sending pictures, they finally will accept the repair and have Fedex pick up your phone. The so called three day service will take a week. Once we finally receive our phone back, we noticed the screen is fixed, but the phone's edges are heavily damaged, it looks like they have been prying or send someone else's phone return. Again 45 minutes on the phone with Samsung Canada and sending pictures the person on the phone said ""You probably damaged it yourself!"". From now on we will stick to Apple products aas they seem to be better build and their service has never disspointed us.

To add to this frustration, the shipping was extremely delayed and it took forever to get here, then when I tried to return it they wouldn't take it back becaus either was past the return window and doesn't qualify for Amazon's A to Z guarantee.

Super Mario 3D was a lot of fun to play and lasted a long time.  Bowser's Fury was a little shorter, but also a lot of fun.  Both are also playable by my 6 year-old grandson who loves both games.  Recommended!

Great game, but hard to get used to the 3Dness
Reviewed in Canada on December 15, 2023Platform for display: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase
My kids love this game, and so do I! After playing Mario Deluxe for a bit, it was time to upgrade. The 3D is really cool and fund to play, BUT, the controls are slightly different and a bit harder to get used to versus 2D. Still think its a great game though and lots of fun.

I was surprised at the game. I didn't think I would first enjoyed it. I totally missed the 3d part. I think it's a great game. I really enjoyed it. I haven't played the Bowser's furry part off the game yet but I'm pretty impressed with Mario 3d.  it's a nice change from the previous Mario games. The graphics are real nice. The game in itself is very entertaining. The game arrived in the expected delay in very good condition. I'm happy with it. I recommend. It's a must have in your super Mario Bros games collection.

Amazing Product- But You Have To Pay a Monthly Fee!!
Reviewed in Canada on April 4, 2018Verified Purchase
I'm torn between a three and four star review.First of all, this is an amazing device. I was diagnosed with Paroxysmal A Fib and it has been a great help for keeping track of things. It has helped with anxiety related to having A Fib as when you feel funny you can take a reading and find out if you're in A Fib or not.However it has some pretty serious issues. First and foremost, there is a monthly fee that is $9.99 American (!) that is above and beyond the cost of the device. This was unwelcome news. You cannot see previous EKG readings unless you pay the monthly fee. You can't keep track of your readings without it. It is ridiculous. YOU CAN'T EVEN SCREENSHOT the readings to save on your phone, they specifically block the ability to do so! If there was a modest yearly fee I think I would be okay with it but nearly $15 Canadian a month to have access to your EKG readings is insane.Also, it seems to pick up background frequencies sometimes resulting in wonky readings that can look really freaky.Overall this is a handy tool if you can afford the monthly fee, otherwise it is a total pain in the butt to try to keep track of the EKG readings. You can email them to yourself but this is a pain.My sincere hope is that Kardia makes this product more affordable and either eliminates or greatly reduces the monthly fee. When I had the free thirty day trial I was very happy with the device, being able to see your past readings was very cool and very helpful. I could show them to my doctor and it was a really excellent tool. However without the ability to save the EKGs it has become a pain to show EKGs to my doctor. I have to email them one by one as they are taken and then later on print them and bring them to my doctor.

It's literally plug and play, great for seniors or the technologically impaired. Remote could be a bit better though, it's pretty basic and takes some getting used to because it's missing some basic buttons.You'll need a good strong wifi signal for the 4k video though because it can suck a lot of bandwidth and will cause stuttering or SWOD (Spinning Wheel of Death) if the feed can't keep up. We had to get the upgraded modem from Shaw and it works great, but on the older Hytron modem it was a swodfest.

The All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is a game-changer when it comes to streaming devices. As someone who loves to binge-watch my favorite shows and movies, this device has completely transformed my entertainment experience.First and foremost, the picture quality of the Fire TV Stick 4K is outstanding. With support for 4K Ultra HD, HDR, and Dolby Vision, the visuals are incredibly sharp, vibrant, and lifelike. Whether I'm watching a movie or a TV show, the colors pop off the screen, and the details are crystal clear. It truly enhances the viewing experience and makes everything more immersive.The performance of the Fire TV Stick 4K is also impressive. It is powered by a quad-core processor and has 8GB of storage, ensuring smooth and lag-free streaming. I have never experienced any buffering or delays while using this device, even when streaming high-resolution content. It also has 802.11ac Wi-Fi support, which provides a fast and stable connection.One of the standout features of the Fire TV Stick 4K is its voice control capabilities. It comes with the Alexa Voice Remote, which allows me to control the device and search for content using just my voice.

It plugs directly into the HDMI port of my TV and connects to the internet. The device also supports Ethernet and Bluetooth connections, providing flexibility in how it is set up. The remote pairs automatically, and I was up and running in just a few minutes.The only minor downside I have noticed is that the remote can be a bit sensitive at times. Occasionally, it may register accidental button presses or respond to background noise. However, this is a minor inconvenience and does not detract from the overall performance of the device.In conclusion, the All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is a must-have for anyone looking to enhance their streaming experience.

Amazing Noise Cancellation & Great out of the box sound.
Reviewed in Canada on February 24, 2022Colour Name: Midnight BlueStyle: WH1000XM4Verified Purchase
Sound Quality (5/5)These are the first headphones I've owned that when first listening to them I didn't immediately flinch and look for the nearest EQ. I'm no sound engineer, but definitely it has great bass and great quality for mids & highs.Noise cancelation (5/5)Although this is my first set of headphones that support this feature. I'm really blown away by it. I have an air purifier in my office, and even at medium setting. The fan is pretty noisy. But with these things on, I can barely hear it, and that's with no music/movie playing. But as soon as I turn on a movie or song, I seriously can't tell it's on.I read some people say they could hear a waterfall or something in the background. I can't hear anything other than silence, or what I'm listening to.Wireless/Wired (4/5)Being able to use the headphones with them powereoff with a wire, or have them connect wireless via bluetooth is an amazing feature. And it works really well!I was really surprised  however that I don't seem to be able to use this headset with the bluetooth of my main PC. It has a really think glass panel, so I'm wondering if it's not because of that. If you own a case with a glass panel, maybe double check with another set of bluetooth headse/earbuds to see how the conenction goes.Audio Delay/lag on Bluetooth (5/5)I own a mini laptop and it only has bluetooth 4.1. But for some reason when I watch videos or movies, I'm  virtually unable to tell whether there is lag. Unlike any other bluetooth earbuds I've owned. The delay is amazing. Obviously your mileage may vary, but it's something that drove me insane with my previous wireless earbuds. Don't have this problem here!Gestures (4/5)I wasn't really looking forward to the gestures pad. But it turns out to be working really well. Once in a while an action won't register. But it's really rare for me.Play/Pause on a PC can be a little weird though. One day I was listening to spotify while working, and then with the tab still opened I started watching youtube after work. And after pausing said video and unpausing it, using the headset. It ended up starting the playback of both my spotify tab, and my youtube tab.Comfort (4/5)First day I wore them I was a little concerned since, even though I have a small head. I felt like the headphones were pretty tight on my head. But after even just 2 days of use. It's already leagues better. Either I got used to it, or it's 'breaking in'.The cups are pretty comfortable. Wish they would be just a tad larger, not sure if I have big ears. But I can tell that part of my right ear touches the pad. And I'm wondering if I ever end up pulling a really long work, or gaming session if it'll end making my ear feel pinched. One of my older headsets did that.One thing that I was happily surprised was the weight of the headset. With such an impressive battery life and suite of features. I was expecting this thing to be rather heavy. Compared to a Corsair Void (probably a bad example) it's light as a feather.Pairing Headphones with 2 Devices (3/5)First thing, this feature is only possible via the headphone's native app. Meaning you can't perform this type of sync with the physical sync button. Once you have the devices regisered on the app, then you can enable a setting and select which 2 devices you want.On the topic of ""2 devices"", I guess Is should have read more on this feature. But I use 2 PCs at home, a media and a work/gaming PC. And I really would have liked to be able to on the fly, switch between audio of both. But it turns out that you can only connect to 1 phone, and something else. It can be 2 phones, but not 2 PCs.Included Accessories (3/5)The case it comes with is great. Hard-shell clam design, with some neat nook where you can shove the USB C charging cable, audio cable and airplane adapter thing. But as much as I like the quality and how it snuggly holds on to and protects the headphones. Not sure if mine is a fluike, but whoever decided to sew the elastic mesh bag on the 'bottom' part of the clam. Kind of silly.The audio cable is 'OK' if you use it for your phone. But if you want to use it for a PC you'll for sure either need an extension or a longer cable period. But at least it's a usesable lenght albeit a little conservative.But the USB type c charging cable. I hope you have a USB hub available. Depending on the case/setup you have. I'm pretty sure a lot of people wouldn't be able to use that cable to connect the headphones to their PC's back USB ports. Well you could do it, but depending on your case or setup. The headphones won't be able to rest on either the top of your case, or the desk/floor it's own. They'll end up dangling. (Which I think would be a bad idea.)

Super comfortable, top music quality
Reviewed in Canada on October 23, 2020Colour Name: BlackStyle: WH1000XM4Verified Purchase
I have a pair of Bose wired QC-35 so this is my base for comparison. I bought these because I was tired of having the cable in my way all the time.Context: I use the XM-4 mostly with my laptop but they're also paired with my Galaxy S10. The only noises I have in my environment are my wife sitting about a meter away from me in our home office and she speaks very loudly when she is in a virtual meeting (and she has quite a lot of them and the keyboard clicks. So, noise cancelling is mostly used for surrounding voice.Let's start with noise cancelling: The Sony XM4 have about the same noise cancellation quality as the wired QC-35 but the XM4 have a white noise that is a bit bugging me when I'm not listening to anything, just using them for noise cancellation while the QC-35 do not have a white noise and can cancel noise as well as the XM4. I mostly use noise cancellation because my wife is sitting about one meter away and she very often takes phone meeting and she speaks quite loudly. The XM4 and the QC-35 cancel about 60% of her voice so when I listen to music, even at low volume I don't hear her at all.Sound: The sound is a bit better than the wired QC-35. The bass is deep and all the frequencies are crisp and clear. I can hear every single instruments very clearly so I can enjoy my music better than ever before. These headphones should definitely be able to satisfy the most demanding audiophiles out there. Also they can play loud enough to damage your ear drums which is pretty good for wireless headphones. The sound is as good whether it comes from my laptop or my Galaxy S10 phone.Calls using my Galaxy S10: If I receive a call on my Galaxy S10 while listening to music on my laptop (or my phone), the XM4 will pause the music and ring in the headphones. A simple double tap on the touch sensor and I can answer the call or reject it by holding a finger on the touch sensor. The quality of the audio during calls is excellent; I can hear very well and I'm told that the sound on the other side of the conversation is very good. I never tried them in a noisy environment or outside when the wind is blowing but Sony states that the XM4 will cancel most of the ambiant noise to keep the other side of the call clean.Features: I love the many features the XM4 offer. Here are a few features I particularly like: 1. When listening to music, I just have to take the headphones off and the XM4 will automatically pause the music thanks to the proximity sensor inside the left can. I simply have to put them back on for the music to start again. 2. When I listen to music and I want to talk to someone, I don't have to take them off, I just have to start talking and the music will automatically pause and the mics on the unit will make sure I can hear what's being said so I can carry a conversation without taking them off. Then, 15 or 30 seconds (configurable) after I stop talking, the music starts again. 3. Finally, the multiple commands I can use on the touch sensor such as volume up/down, next/previous song, fast-forward/backward and more. Another feature that is nice for those who want to use it is the integration with Alexa or Google assistant. However since I do not use any assistant, I cannot comment on this.Comfort: I have regular size ears so the cups surround them completely and do not put pressure on any part of my ears. I was able to wear them for 9 hours straight (while wearing glasses) with one short break in the middle for lunch and I felt no discomfort. Comparatively, the QC-35 have about the same size cup but the leather on the QC-35 is more comfortable than on the XM4.App: The Sony ""Headphone"" app is pretty good and complete, helping you customize your headphone sound and behavior very easily. You can configure an equalizer to adjust the sound to your specific preferences, customize the function of the second button on the left ear piece, turn on/off different feature of the XM4, update the firmware, and more. If your willing to give the app GPS location permission, you can have different configuration depending on where you are, home, office, commute, etc. This is a big one for me, I'm not forced to give GPS location permission to the app, contrary to the Bose Bluetooth headphone app. With Bose, if you don't give GPS location permission, you can't even pair your headphones! I won't comment on the location feature of the XM4 since I'm not using it but I'm happy I'm not forced to give this permission.Cons: I had to think hard to find any cons but here they are. 1. I cannot use the headphones while charging but this is minor since the battery life is so long and you can use them with the supplied 3.5mm cord but without the mic function. 2. The cushions on the QC-35 are more comfortable, softer than the ones on the XM4. I've read a lot of reviews mentioning problems with TV sound so I tested my MX4 with my Samsung Smart TV; the pairing was easy enough but the sound was constantly choppy so I would not recommend them if you want to watch TV with them.Summary: As far as I know, as of now these are the best wireless headphones on the planet! Great sound, feature rich and very comfortable but not recommended for TV watching.

I get these from Costco but they sell out often bc they are just that freaking delicious so I sometimes look on amazon to get them even if I have to pay a bit more. I enjoy them myself but my 15 yo autistic son drinks a lot of them. Like ALOT.  He's into fitness yes but he has always had profound sensory issues surrounding food s& would eat the same few things all the time, so the Fairlife chocolate shakes are a staple and help get him in some protein & vitamins. He has actually started expanding his palate a bit and eating a bit more variety lately since introducing these drinks. 30g of protein, lactose free & tastes like chocolate milk, what’s not to love? :)  I digress, but yes, this sellers response time & customer service is another level. And the drinks are outstanding.

Instructions are unambiguous, and I have not had any issues in almost 3months of use. Do not get intimidated by its size, keep it in a corner where you will not have to move it. Overall, this is a great product that cuts down my cooking time and makes me want to try out recipes.

Better than an Actifry by far.
Reviewed in Canada on November 10, 2020Style: 8-Quart/Stainless SteelVerified Purchase
We bought this to replace an Actifry because we broke our second Actifry and third Actifry mixer. I confess that we always put more fries into the Actifry than recommend due to the small amount it would make. We found that the Ninja air fryer made much better fries and chicken wings than the Actifry and didn't beat the food into bits. It cooked the fries much better too. Definitely could cook a lot of fries and make them nice and crisp. You do have to mix them up 3 or 4 times to cook them evenly.  Clean up was also much easier than the Actifry. Cooked a whole chicken using the air fry method and it was the best I have ever made. Cooked a roast using the same method and it was amazing. Tried using the pressure cooker/air fryer method and was not impressed with how the chicken turned out. I need to figure out if I am doing something wrong here. The pressure cooker does work well as far as I know. The machine is not loud like the Actifry. The machine seems to be very well made and the controls are simple to use. Very glad I purchased it. Did I mention how easy it is to clean? After cooking a roast I only had to rinse it out and gently wipe it with a cloth. One last thing, although the machine fills the kitchen with the normal smells of cooking, it does not smoke like some other air fryers.

 I love the air fry feature, I was scared of the pressure cooker but when I saw how simple it is to use, I got over it pretty quick. My husband loves the steamer function, it used to take him 30 minutes to steam his fish, now it takes 8! I haven't had a need for the other functions yet but Im sure I will at some point.My only issue is with the sauté/sear function: Med is really high, basically boiling,  and Lo Med is nothing, it takes forever to cook with it at this heat so those type of dishes will need to be done on the stove still. Other then that, I absolutely recommend this!

Reviewed in Canada on February 26, 2021Style: 8-Quart/Stainless SteelVerified Purchase
When I first started using the foodie, I  wanted to sell it, thinking I made an expensive mistake.  The first few meals came out pretty rough, and were a pain to make.  For some reason I had it in my head that it's a set and forget appliance, but it depends on the recipe.I  decided to hold onto it a bit longer and try a few more recipes from the internet before giving up on it, and I'm glad I did.  Just with anything new, using the foodie has a bit of a learning curve, nothing crazy, but once I had a few favorite recipes picked out and made a few times, using the foodie got easier, and meals were prepared much more quickly than when I first started using it.Long story short, I love this thing. Works great, super easy to clean.  It's a beast, but super handy for whipping up quick meals for the kids when it's chicken nuggets and fries night.Other meals I made in this thing was a killer chillie verde, and a decent potato soup too.  I have used it for broiling half loaves of cheesy garlic bread, reheating foods, and all sorts of stuff.Totally recommend this appliance.Try and score it while on sale though. Full price is a bit much imo.

Reviewed in Canada on July 21, 2021Style: 8-Quart/Stainless SteelVerified Purchase
I love my Ninja Foodi Deluxe. It's extremely versatile and I find the parts clean up very easily if soaked a few minutes then soap and water. I have been using other people's Ninja for a few years and finally couldn't resist getting my own. It took a bit of learning to use it, but it's not that difficult.  I use it 2 or 3 times a day,  at least. I am vegan, so lots of veggies and vegan meat alternatives cook up beautifully with so many cooking options.  I use it for several different things at once before washing the parts. So great to have it in the hot weather,  as it really doesn't give off much heat at all. It definitely takes up a good chunk of space,  so as I have a small kitchen,  I got a stand for it. I find that the Foodi has worn well over time, also,  as my friend has used theirs regularly for almost 2 years now. No issues.  It's a very exciting kitchen addition!

Its okay. Nice, but has its flaws
Reviewed in Canada on December 25, 2023Verified Purchase
A few things about this:1) The balaclava looks great. Dry fitting it, it also feels good. It's not thick and not the thinnest one either, but maybe more on the slightly thinner side. Putting on a hat or a helmet would not be an issue. When putting it on, it's comfortable. The lower part easily comes up and can be put down under the chin due to the stitching design. Other masks I've tried become too tight when I try to put it down under my chin, but not this one.2) The head piece is odd to me. When I put the balaclava on, I feel like I need to pull it down to stop just above my eyes, or else its way up my forehead. But, when I do this, the mask goes up a bit in the back, feels a bit weird, but manageable. Not that bad. But I feel like over time it would inch back up ever so slowly. So you may need to pull it down a tad every bit. So, the fit is a bit more on the smaller end I would say.3) The ventilation holes on the mask is nice, but I also think its not the best. When I had the balaclava on, and a pair of sunglasses, it instantly fogged up on the first breath. Would it be better with ski goggles? Not sure. With glasses, it was horrid. BUT, what did stop the fogging was by fixing where the holes in the mask were placed on your face. The holes are a bit too low, about 1/2-1"" too low. I had to roll the top part of the mask higher up on my nose. When doing this, the air coming out of my nose or mouth released through the holes better, instead of partially though the fabric and the holes, which caused fogging. So, to stop the fogging, I rolled the top portion of the nose covering to prevent this. Basically, brining the nose/mouth holes up a bit higher. Unfortunately, you cant just put it up higher as it then covers your eyes, so you have to roll/fold over the top part. It looks weid from someone elses perspective, but stopped the fogging in my glasses.So, its hard to say if I like this or not. I dont hate it as it is one of the better designs I've used, but a bit annoyed with the nose/mouth hole designs. The head piece is manageable as I just pull it down a bit, and its fine, but the breathing holes are a bit more of an issue to me. Maybe Ill just keep rolling it up and deal with it, unless I find an alternative, or modify it a bit somehow

This balaclava is good quality, feels nice, and has no inherent issues as far as I can tell. However it's advertised as also fitting in motorcycle helmets - this is not the case (at least for me). I have a full face helmet (AGV K1-S) that is perfectly my size (snug as it should be), but it will absolutely not fit with this balaclava on, which is what I purchased it for. If the intended use for this product is to wear it underneath a helmet (at least a full face helmet), it will not fit unless your helmet is larger than your head for some reason.With that being said, if you are not a motorcycle rider with a full face helmet, this balaclava seems like an excellent choice.

So, I got this ski balaclava for my 12-year-old aspiring snowboarder, thinking it would keep him warm and stylish on the slopes. Well, let me tell you, it's been a ride down the hilarity hill ever since. Picture this: my son, bundled up like a snow ninja, ready to conquer the mountain. But the moment he puts on this balaclava, he transforms into a cross between an Arctic explorer and a bank robber. Every time he tries to talk, it's like listening to someone speak through a pillow fort – muffled and ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the looks he gets from fellow snowboarders. It's like they've stumbled upon a real-life cartoon character shredding down the mountain. So, if you're looking to turn your kid into the next big thing in snowboard comedy, this ski balaclava is the perfect accessory. Just don't be surprised if he starts auditioning for the role of the abominable snowman in the next big blockbuster!""

When not compared to studio or HIGH prices microphones it's stellar.
Reviewed in Canada on May 9, 2013Colour Name: SilverStyle: MicrophoneVerified Purchase
I bought this after dealing with an absolutely terrible $80 microphone and I've been completely satisfied with this microphone.The packaging was solid. There were no rattling parts and it had the ""box within a box"" packaging style that just assures it's survival of shipping. When I unpackaged this thing I was expecting some assembly to be needed. In other reviews I heard that it's almost a foot tall. However they tackled this in a very ingenious way. The microphone was just swiveled completely upside down on its stand making it super compact and pre-built.The stand itself is incredibly sturdy and keeps the microphone really stable, one thing I've noticed is that the microphone can still pick up the rumbling of my typing or other things on my desk, that being said it was never advertised any other way and why would you be typing while recording something?The microphone is great quality, its nice and heavy and sturdy and built with good materials. There is talk that the knobs seem fragile but I have to say that it's SUPER nitpicking. The volume knob in the front is the only one of the 3 that seems brittle but unless you try to pick up the mic with it or something I'm sure it's fine. The other knobs on the product are SOLID. I never really thought that knobs could feel more sturdy than sturdy but these ones do that.I've recorded a couple things so far and the quality of this mic meets the same quality as my friends $200 microphone. (I dont know it's name so I cant provide it (It isn't available on amazon.ca or .com anyways))The highs are crisp without making the recording squeal and the gain knob allows you to easily adjust its sensitivity for whatever recordings you're hoping to make. The stereo option is really cool though I haven't personally had any reason to use it other than to move around it going ""wooooahoooooooaaaaaaaaaaoooooooooaaaahhhhooooo"" and listening to it change around on my headphones. It maintains it's sound quality throughout all of its modes including stereo.Over all I'm incredibly impressed with this entire product. The sound is great, the quality of the hardware is better than expected, it's sturdy, the packaging was incredibly secure it has a plethora of input types, the stand is just as sturdy and quality as the mic itself and its design is great. Its slick and clean looking. Something you would be happy to have sitting on your desk.Get yourself a spring mount thing to get rid of any potential rattling of the surface it's sitting on and I assure you that if you have any low budget or hobbyist projects, this microphone can absolutely meet your demands.

5 Year Later Review
Reviewed in Canada on January 23, 2023Colour Name: SilverStyle: MicrophoneVerified Purchase
5 years later. Lots of hype over this mic. What did I learn.Highly suggest a boom arm. Having it sit on a table will not give you the most this mic has to offer.Learn the mic. Take the time to learn the settings. Test it with an audio recording software, many freeware options to try.Don’t talk to close - adjust your distance. Also adjust the mic gain & the recording level, to avoid any unneeded background sounds. Take the effort of setting up your environment.Ideal for voice narrations, podcasts (but adjust & test the quality), zoom calls (a headset would be better…mic sticks out in video & does create a lot of conversation.. likely asking you if you’re YouTuber…)Suggestions. Get software that works for you. So you can edit the recordings. This is audio, not video. You don’t need a powerful computer to edit audio.Spend the time with the mic & adjust the distance & recording levels.After 5 years with the mic, I can say it’s built strong, but it would been nice if recording software was including. The mic has weight too it & is built strong. Mine is 5 years old & still looks new.

Served me well but the size, weight and flawed 5/8"" thread had me weary.
Reviewed in Canada on January 22, 2018Colour Name: SilverStyle: MicrophoneVerified Purchase
Great Condenser Microphone for all intents and purposes. Be wary: at the time of purchase refurbished models were the version with the 5/8"" thread about 1/16"" oversized. I had used this microphone on a boom arm and no 5/8"" mic stand adapters would fit properly. A bit of teflon or plumbers tape mostly solves the issue but it is not fool proof. Did not feel safe having the microphone suspended upside down or horizontally and would not use an official blue yeti shock mount as it requires the 5/8 thread to fit snugly. I mainly used this for voice while streaming, over voip, and occasionally to record acoustically or through an amplifier.Pros: Sounds great and incredibly clear even without EQ. Instrument and amplifier recordings sound good. I'm no professional in that regard, but I was more than happy with the result. USB makes it easy to use without the need for a DAC or mixer. Cardioid pattern and gain knobs are easy to use and useful for different situations. Easy to monitor sound directly from the microphone via headphone jack. Doesn't feel flimsy or cheap, it's heavy and feels tough.Cons: As this is a condenser microphone it picks up everything. Fiddling with gain and input volumes will decrease ambient noise. This wasn't much of a problem until I decided I wanted a shock mount. Which brings me to my next con: It's big and heavy. Much bigger and heavier than it needs to be. To my knowledge no third party shock mounts will work with the yeti. It's size and build is so far from the industry standard for microphones that you are locked into Blue's ecosystem. Along with a flawed 5/8"" thread I was unable to use a shock mount with the yeti and it picks up every rumble and tap I made on the desk. Did I mention it's big? It took up a lot of space in front of me which got tiresome.

Ever since I smelled someone wearing this years ago it has been my go-to. When you spray it on it dosent spread everywhere and linger, it lingers for about an hour and then you can’t really smell it, but it keeps clothing smelling amazing if you spray it on a shirt or dress, I sprayed it on one of my hoodies and left it in my locker over spring break and when I came back the purfume smelled so good on it.It smells sweet at first but fades into something more “adulty” and sophisticated, I would say this perfume could actually work as a unisex scent such as some of the Calvin clein perfumes. I enjoy it and I would recommend!

The packaging was good. The bottle is beautiful. The scent is absolutely amazing, a sweet perfume that is not so sweet that it annoys you as you are wearing it and is cut by deep woody notes, making it almost unisex. My one issue with the perfume itself is that it does not last long and is not very strong. Other than that, this is a unique and worthwhile scent that just can't be described.

Higher highs and lower lows than Breath of the Wild
Reviewed in Canada on December 13, 2023Verified Purchase
Tears of the Kingdom is an excellent game. The design is, of course, stunning. The gameplay is the same delightful formula as Breath of the Wild, but with a bigger map and even more ways to play around thanks to the new device building mechanics. I think the best way to summarize Tears of the Kingdom is that it has higher highs and lower lows than Breath of the Wild. The story is much better this time around, with the non playable characters actually involved in the story this time, and even slightly improved voice acting! The music is beautifully composed and performed. The map is, of course, much larger due to the sky islands and the depths. The sky islands have lots to discover with plenty of variety. In my opinion, the temples were much more fun than the divine beasts of Breath of the Wild. The new mechanics in this game are like being a kid with an infinite supply of Legos. You can make almost anything you imagine, and you can often use the new mechanics to find unique solutions to puzzles or quicker ways to defeat enemies. The game adds new enemies that helped keep the gameplay from feeling too repetitive (for the most part). I think the game did a better job rewarding players for completion/curiosity than Breath of the Wild. The ending was fantastic. Tears of the Kingdom is an excellent fantasy adventure that you won't mind getting lost in for hours.This game is not perfect, however. First of all, the size of the world is a problem in this game. For instance, the depths map is massive, but it doesn't have much variety. You can find some cool armor and his weapons from it, but it just feels like too much map for what it offers. The other major complaint that I (and many other players) have is that the sage powers you get for completing the main temples in the game are somewhat useless aside from helping you out in the final boss fights. Without spoiling things, they can be useful, but the way you use them is unreliable, leading to frustration. My other disappointment is that the shrine puzzles in this game are just not as clever as the shrines in Breath of the Wild. For almost all of them, the first thing I tried was the solution, and even finding the bonus chests in the shrines was too easy.In spite of the few shortcomings I've listed, Tears of the Kingdom is a high quality Nintendo game. I think the ambitious gameplay variety and the overall quality of life improvements over its predecessor easily make it worth buying. I think Breath of the Wild might be the better of the two games, but that's more of a testament to the brilliant work that Nintendo puts into the Zelda series.

This is the best Zelda game I’ve played. It’s like botw but so much more. So many puzzles and new places to explore. Way better abilities. Take your time playing this game cause once it’s over you will be sad.

It's everything Breath of the Wild is, but better.
Reviewed in Canada on June 30, 2023Verified Purchase
Tears of the Kingdom is a sequel to Breath of the Wild, but it feels like more of a remake than an actual sequel. Sure, the story is set after the events of BotW, however the game functionally uses the same map, the same engine, and the same concepts and adds onto every single one of them.The story is better, the mechanics have been refined, the combat is given more layers with the fuse system, the amount of ways to complete an objective is astounding, and there's more to explore with the addition of caves, sky islands, and the depth caverns. The amount of content this game holds is legendary and will easily net you 100+ hours of gameplay. If you didn't play BotW, skip it and play this. If you did play BotW back on release, play this too! It's familiar, but new enough to feel fresh and exciting. I do hope however that the next Zelda game will use an entirely new map, because Nintendo has clearly exhausted themselves with this iteration of Hyrule.That being said, TotK is an incredible Zelda experience that rewards the player with creativity and player choice and is a definitive staple of the Switch library.

Legend of Zelda: TOTK and BOTW 🤌🤌🤌
Reviewed in Canada on September 28, 2023Verified Purchase
What’s there to say? TOTK’s predecessor and TOTK itself is a great game. Both games have a ton of hidden little easter eggs that keep me interested. The story line wasn’t as clear in TOTK, unlike BOTW. Even so, TOTK brought many new features. Many of the features from BOTW carried over to TOTK. I love that in TOTK, regional heroes? like Tulin or Sidon can fight alongside you. The map of Hyrule is now crazy large as well. Instead of one map, you have 3 maps of different layers of Hyrule. You got the Sky Islands, Surface and Depths. More areas to discover = more easter eggs and fun. Over all, great game.

Reviewed in Canada on May 4, 2020Platform for display: SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase
Originally I did not think this would be a game for me. A real life friend who I also play at lot of PS4 with kept going on and on about this game and eventually just handed the game cartidage for me to try.-Well I tried Luigi's Mansion 3 and I loved it. The game play is smooth, which makes it easy to see and make out objects.  The puzzles weren't overly difficult. Basically a Mario brothers game that ensures everyone can progress and move on Which is great because very few game developers take the time to think of the ageing game base, as well as making it inviting to those who are looking for a pick up game, which you can leave behind and not have to worry about ""rust"" time, since the controls are pretty simple to fallow and remember.I ended up buying this game 3 times.  Once for my self, and then the other two went to parents; who may have grown up during the budding video game era but had to work for a living and didn't have the time to play. So the game play for them was very enjoyable. It started off have to hear the ""OH well I didn't grow up doing this like you"" or some other excuse those who are more seasoned in life say when they're unsure of new tech/game. But with out a doubt they're both fell in love with the game.-The game is quick and easy to pick up, and is very user friendly. Plus I get the chuckle every time my mother sounds like The Joker off Batman when she sucks a new ghost into the vacuum, and then proceeds to trash talk her hubby. Personally I feel this is a worth it game, with out question.

I saw someone streaming the game and thought it looked like fun. I decided to get it and it has not disappointed. The cowardly brother whooping ghost butt, slamming them around like it's nothing. The vacuum is a fun mechanic as is the ""Gooigi"". I can admit I get stuck trying to figure out how to find gems even if I bought a tracker and know it's in an area. Boos are fun and cute to collect as well. Boss battles are interesting and kinda difficult at times if you don't figure out the gimmick or fast enough to flash, etc. It's the right amount of everything. I'm sure the Luigi's Mansion 2 HD remake will be great as well. Fingers crossed!

The pheromones infused in the cologne add an extra layer of attraction, making it irresistible to those around you.The roll-on design of the cologne is another great feature. It's easy to apply, and the compact size makes it convenient to carry with you anywhere you go. The roll-on applicator also ensures that you can control the amount of cologne you use, making it a more economical choice than traditional spray colognes.The pheromone-infused formula of this cologne is another great advantage. Pheromones are natural chemicals that the body produces to attract the opposite sex, and the added pheromones in this cologne are a great way to enhance your natural appeal. The pheromones in the cologne work to increase your confidence and attractiveness, making you more desirable to those around you.In terms of price, the Pure Instinct Roll-On for Men is a great value for the quality of the product.

Don't be quick to judge, the scent really transforms with your body chemistry.
Reviewed in Canada on May 12, 2021Verified Purchase
I will have to update this review at some point as I have only been using it for 2 days and I've only been at home with family. My experience so far with this perfume has been interesting. I don't ever have a bad body odor so I can get away without showering few days, washing the important parts only lol. I found that on the first day, where I hadn't showered for almost 3 days, the scent lasted almost all day. I wonder if this is due to my own pheromones marrying the ones in this oil. Because I showered today, and put the oil on inside my wrists, behind my ears, my sternum and inside my elbows just as I had the day before but the projection of the scent only lasted an hour or two. HOWEVER. I want to talk about the scent itself. When I first got it I really didn't know what to think of it. I'm not really a fruity perfume kind of person, I prefer gourmand or earthy scents. I liked it in a way but it was almost sickly sweet to me at some times of me smelling it. I notice today I actually have really grown to like the scent, not just by itself but when I go to smell my wrists a few hours after applying I find the scent has mellowed and really transformed in combination with my own natural scent. It's not sickly sweet anymore, it almost has warmed a little, softened, and I find there is a smell that I can't quite identify that I really like and i believe it's the pheromone aspect mixing with my own. I know this isn't supposed to work on yourself and mainly others around you, but when I smell myself a few hours after applying I can really see how people would be drawn to the scent. Sniffing it out of the bottle probably not, but on the skin after a few hours it's so subtle and almost just enhances your natural scent. I will update this when I get the chance to test around others, but so far as just a perfume, for how little you use per application and how nice your body smells after putting it on, I think it's worth it.

Been trying this for a while….
Reviewed in Canada on August 29, 2022Verified Purchase
Okay so I bought this a couple of weeks ago and thought I should try it before writing a review because I saw a lot of mixed reviews on this… At first, I thought the smell was horrible ( kinda like the smell of public bathroom soap), but after wearing it for a couple of minutes, the smell fades and adapts to your own scent. I would say the dry down kinda smells like I just got out of the shower, smells a little floral and clean and the smell is light. I feel it amplifies your own smell so I started to like it more and more. I almost always wear it with another perfume on top ( because I like smelling good and wear perfume everyday and the scent of this one is not potent enough for me alone).Now for the pheromones part… I did notice something different when I’m wearing this. First, my hubby seems to be way more affectionate and he’s way more tactile ( holding my hand, hugging me etc) and he tends to tell me I look pretty and stuff like that even tho I’m wearing my pj’s… it is not drastic by any means but it kinda sparks his interest a little more than usual. I also noticed more people coming to talk to me or standing close to me when I’m wearing it in public and a lot more people looking at me, smiling at me etc. So to me it is very subtle and not crazy at all. Overall I like it.

It has a flowery scent maybe more jasmine. As to the pheromones, it is the animatic scent of musk. The scent is the pheromone.

This is a really cute toy, looks and sounds real!  Of course, I wasn't expecting it to work as well as a real vacuum but was expecting a bit of suction. Unfortunately it doesn't pick up dirt at all. If your child actually enjoys vacuuming like mine does, this toy is very frustrating because they'll go over the dirt or crumbs over and over again without seeing any results...

Reviewed in Canada on January 10, 2024Verified Purchase
When my first purchase arrived and didn't work, I thought I got a dud. 3 replacements later, and I still haven't received one that functions. I have tried fresh batteries and re-chargeables, and still nothing works. One of the replacements that I received even had part of a return label still attached, so it was probably a return that didn't work that was then sent to me. I have wasted so much time trying to find one that works and am convinced at this point that the batteries don't even lead to a mechanism that does anything. I had such high hopes as it really is a cute product, but not worth the price if it's not going to function at all.

As a faithful remake of game from the 1980s, Link's Awakening features pretty barebones gameplay. But the core gameplay loop is so solid that it still works pretty well. I'd have preferred to see some more modern mechanics in a few sections but, to quote Reggie, ""the game is fun"". The environments are absolutely gorgeous and very charming. Paying full price for a remake of a 35-year-old game hurts my soul though.

Incredible AirPods Pro 2nd Gen with MagSafe Case - A Lifesaver!
Reviewed in Canada on March 29, 2024Style: USB-C ConnectorVerified Purchase
I recently purchased the Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Generation with MagSafe Case, and they have truly been a game-changer for me. Not only do they provide exceptional sound quality and seamless connectivity, but they also come with a feature that saved me from a major headache.Unfortunately, I lost my AirPods Pro at my workplace, and someone took them. However, thanks to the Find My feature from Apple, I was able to locate them with ease. The ability to lock the AirPods remotely gave me peace of mind knowing that they couldn't be used by anyone else, and the pinpoint accuracy of the Find My app helped me track them down quickly.Aside from this incredible feature, the AirPods Pro themselves are outstanding. The sound quality is crisp and immersive, making every listening experience enjoyable. The active noise cancellation works like a charm, blocking out external noise and allowing me to focus on my music or podcasts without distractions.The MagSafe Case is another highlight of this product. Not only does it provide convenient wireless charging, but it also ensures that my AirPods Pro stay secure and protected when not in use. The sleek design of both the AirPods and the case adds a touch of elegance to my daily routine.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Generation with MagSafe Case. Not only do they deliver exceptional audio quality and convenience, but they also come with a lifesaving feature in the form of Find My. Five stars without a doubt!

I've never been able to enjoy apple earbuds or the first gen AirPods. These are totally different. The set up and fit is great. The noise cancelling feature is great and you can set it up to work in a way that background noises and voices can be heard (great feature for safety when walking and you want to hear what's going on around you). These AirPods Pro 2nd Gen have adaptive EQ, which adjusts its sound depending on your listening conditions. For example, if you are a louder listener, you will get a less bass heavy, less treble-heavy sound signature; vice versa if you listen quieter.I recommend these

New iPhone used and seriously impressed
Reviewed in Canada on November 25, 2023Style: USB-C ConnectorVerified Purchase
I was a Samsung android user for about 15 years and finally decided to make the switch to iPhone with the new 15 Pro lineup, as I love my  M1 MBP and I have been following Apple  products from afar since. Now that the 15 lineup is USB C, I decided to go all in on the Apple ecosystem.I am blown away by these airpods. Thankfully the second gens come with XS ear tips, because that's the only size that doesn't slowly push themselves out of my ear.But let me get to what I really love about these things:- the seamless transfer of connection between my M1 macbook pro and iPhone. It happens in about 1.5 seconds flat as soon as I begin playing audio/video on another device. And somehow it also knows when I don't need it to transfer?! I don't even know.-the charging speed of the pods themseld. I think I just popped them into the case for 10 mins, less than 15 for sure, and they jumped from 18% charge to 80% just like that.-transparency and noise cancellation. Remarkable and I use both depending on my environment. Haven't really found a use for Adaptive mode after a while, but that's ok. When you're walking on a busy street, noise cancellation is so soothing. Drowns out like 90-95% of the traffic sounds.-conversational awareness is great too, but I generally leave it off unless I'm in a grocery store or somewhere that I might need to interrupt the audio by speaking to someone for a few seconds. Only time I use it.- Con: they're super slippery! I have dropped the pods a couple of times because of this, especially when you get any skin oils on them, but no damage so far. I also just got a silicone cover for the charging case, in hopes that the pods don't just eject themselves when you drop the whole case on the floor. I think that fixed my concern in some quick tests from a 2 foot drop on carpet, because I've seen them eject from that height before.BONUS: These airpod pro 2s with USB C have a special feature that lightning cable pro 2s do not! Lossless audio, but this only applies to using them with the Vision Pro. I probably won't but the Vision Pro any time soon, but it's good to know that I will have that feature should I ever get them in the future.Buy these at full price or especially buy them when you see them 10-17% off. You will NOT be disappointed.

The best earbuds I’ve ever owned
Reviewed in Canada on March 16, 2024Style: USB-C ConnectorVerified Purchase
I was using Google Pixel Buds Pro with my iPhone 11 for less than a year, and I was satisfied, until they stopped holding a charge last week. I was pretty upset when they stopped working because I use earbuds most of the day while I’m working, and even at home. This week I was reading reviews on several top quality earbuds and I was almost sold on Bose because I have always enjoyed the sound quality of Bose products, in my opinion they are one of the highest quality speakers in the industry. Bose and Apple AirPod Pro 2nd generation are nearly identical in quality and performance from the dozens of reviews that I read. The only reason I chose Apple is because I am an iPhone user, and the functions and features of these earbuds work seamlessly with iPhones. Where as, the Bose earbuds require an additional app to control the features on an iPhone, such as spacial audio, noise cancellation, transparency mode, etc. I also really like that the earbuds themselves, as well as the charging case are able to be tracked or located with Apple’s native FindMy app, this is huge, no more loosing my earbuds when I fall asleep while they are in use. Overall, I am very happy with this product, and I look forward to seeing how well the noise canceling system works on the shooting range, my shooting partner swears by his Airpod Pro 1st generation, so I can’t wait to see how 2nd generation compares.

This game appears dense at first, but it is quite easy to learn, and games can be played inside of 30 minutes once you know the ins and outs of gameplay. The theme and setting really appeals to me, and the board and cards are beautiful.  The train pieces leave a bit to be desired, but understandably at this price.

Great console - very relaxing
Reviewed in Canada on August 4, 2017Colour Name: Black + TurquoiseVerified Purchase
I can't compare this to the older 3DS models but I love this thing so far. The build quality, battery life, and overall ergonomics seem really great. I got I'd say bigger hands and this thing feels fairly comfortable, my left hand gets a little cramped after extended play time, but it's not too bad. I didn't want the ""wedge"" 2DS model so this was well worth the wait and a good decision by Nintendo overall.So far I've played the Hatsune Miku game and Monster Hunter Ultimate 4. Being a PC gamer most of my adult life, I've been really impressed with how this console performs and plays these games. Sure, the graphics aren't AMAZING, but for a portable handheld it's a very relaxing way to play. It's also worth mentioning that since they sacrifice graphics, you get games with stellar gameplay and content. I can already tell I'm gonna get potentially hundreds of hours out of both Monster Hunter and Miku, both have tons of replay value and are just really fun to play (I've never played any other of the games in the series, so I can't compare).I'd say at this point this console alone for 3DS games has a solid 20+ exclusive titles to play, as well as an enormous DS library available (many of which are exclusive, never been ported, etc). Lots of remakes of DS games are coming out this year and next, some of the best games ever made in the past 10 years easily. Overall I'd highly recommend this console, it's an amazing companion to have as a PC gamer to change it up.

I'm a fan of JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games) and picked up Shin Megami Tensei IV and Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth.  I also picked up Super Mario 3D Land.The system is equipped with two screens and a stylus (one being a touch screen) and, in all honesty, I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I have.  The touchscreen, instead of being a gimmick, really excels as a tool supplementing gameplay in different ways, whether it be a way to access in-game inventory items on the fly, or displaying map information while exploring a dungeon; it is really neat.The stereo speakers are decent, although not very loud, but there is a headphone jack (no headphones included).  It comes shipped with a 2GB microSD card which you can upgrade later if you plan on connecting to WiFi and buying games from the Nintendo Shop.  If you're using Nintendo 3DS game cartridges you can save right to the cartridge.All-in-all, I'm very happy with this purchase.  Never been a fan of hand-held consoles and yet this little device has converted me.  Very entertaining.  Nice work, Nintendo!

Product came in perfect shape and mostly as described, but had a bigger microSD than listed (8GB as opposed to the listed 2GB) and the system came with custom firmware preloaded despite the listing not mentioning that fact, which was quite the pleasant surprise. Seeing as I had planned to put custom firmware on the console as soon as I received it anyway, seeing it already installed saved me some time and effort. Overall wonderful experience!

Get this game!! You will not regret it!!
Reviewed in Canada on April 5, 2021Style: Taco Cat Goat Cheese PizzaVerified Purchase
My wife and I bought this as a quick and fun game to play with our kids and friends. It did not disappoint!— What comes in the box: This game is literally a standard size deck of cards with different game images printed on them. The images consist of a “taco”, a “cat”, a “goat”, a piece of “cheese”, a piece of “pizza”, a “groundhog”, a “narwhal” and a “gorilla”. You also get a set of instructions for how to play the game, although I highly recommend watching a video online of how to play. Not because the game is difficult, because you will see just how much fun you will have.— Packaging: The packaging is a well made cardboard box with a magnetic “flip edge”. The box is small enough that you could pack it easily in a purse or small bag to take anywhere.— Card Quality: as previously mentioned, the cards are standard playing card size. The images printed on them are large, bright and colorful, which lends to the playability of the game. We have played the game several times and have not had any issues with the cards bending, becoming “dog-eared” or fading. The cards have a nice finish and could be wiped easily with a slightly damp cloth followed by a dry one, but you still need to be careful with them around liquids as the game gets quite animated ;) Overall, the cards seem durable and you can likely expect these cards to wear as you would a quality set of standard playing cards.— Playability: The game makers say this game is for ages 8+ and for a minimum of 2 players up to 8 players. I am quite confident that a 5 year old could easily play this game given the opportunity. It would likely be tough to play with more than 8 players due to space constraints and people’s ability to reach across the table, but if you needed to play with more than 8, I guess you could just buy a second set of cards.— How to play: I won’t go in to great detail here (watch a video, remember?) The name of the game is to get rid of all of your cards first. This game essentially involves players playing cards in succession and saying a word (either “taco”, “cat”, “goat”, “cheese” or “pizza”) and if the card laid by the player matches the word said by the player, all players have to slap their hands on top of the discard pile deck. The last one to get their hands down has to take all cards from the discard pile and add to their own pile of cards. There are other action cards as well, which is where more fun comes in, but again, watch a video.— Game hint: This game involves a lot of slapping on top of other peoples hands. We purchased a half dozen cheap oven mitts from our local Dollarama store, which helps when playing with younger kids or rambunctious adults :) it also looks and feels completely ridiculous, which again adds to the fun. Not a requirement, but an option.— Conclusion: If you are looking for a super fun and fast paced game to play with friends/family look no further. We literally cry with laughter every time we play this and it works well with both kids and adults. Dare I say, with the adults and a few adult beverages, it is even more fun.Get this game, you will not regret it!!!

Reviewed in Canada on February 23, 2021Verified Purchase
After reading a few reviews of people complaining about the bad quality of this board game, I hesitated to buy it. However, the game seemed fun and the price on Amazon was lower than other stores so I decided to give it a try. I am very satisfied of my purchase. This game is so much fun and I had no problem with the quality of the board along with the different components that comes with it. I like that you spin a wheel of numbers instead of using a dice which makes it more interesting. I also really like that there are different paths you can choose from which gives more variety every time you play. The ending of the game is always different depending mainly on luck but also the choices you make. I enjoy answering the questions on action cards which makes the game more socially interactive. Even if it is a game of 4 players max, it was still fun with only 2 players. My only complains would be that the pegs are small, the bills are flimsy and the cards are very pointy on the corners. Just little details that could be improved but otherwise I recommend playing this board game with friends and family.

The game of life
Reviewed in Canada on May 17, 2021Verified Purchase
Great game for kids and adults alike.  Most people have played this game...my gripes about this version are:1.  The spinner is junk...it isn't attached to the board so it's always flopping all over the place or won't spin properly because you have kids playing this game who don't realize they should anchor it with their other hand before spinning.  I find I'm often holding onto it when it's the kids turns so it stays in one place and they can spin it more properly.  After about a year, the colours beneath it started to shift too so it doesn't line up, which is frustrating.2.  There are too many things...like why do we need pets involved?  You have a pet to start, get married, and potentially have kids yet they left the vehicle with the same amount of spaces (6)...we've had more than 6 passengers several times and with pieces that small, you really don't want to be putting them aside to count up for points at the end of the game.3.  The spin to win...you get tiny cardboard circles you can place on the wheel...you are more than likely to lose these although somehow we haven't yet.  I always forget to place them because you get spin to win so many times it just gets too annoying so we just yell out what we want.4.  There are way too many action cards.My kid loves this game though and we have had fun playing it.  It is a good game but improvements could be made especially to the spinner...seriously, when are they going to get that thing right?

Love This Game!
Reviewed in Canada on March 4, 2019Verified Purchase
As an effort to get the grandkids off screens and actually doing something together, I bought this game. It was my favorite as a child so I knew what to expect. The grandkids love it and we play frequently. We leave the spinner unattached, and pass it to the player, as my table is large. It also makes storage perfect, as others have noted, you cannot close the box with the spinner attached. The kids particularly like the careers better than the old version, which they called ‘ boring’. They have my old game their mother ‘ borrowed’ from me decades ago, so this game holds up. We partner up my 6 yo granddaughter, as this game is too hard for a child who cannot do math in the thousands. That works well for us as we are 5 and only 4 can play. Good , clean fun for all ages!

Reviewed in Canada on July 2, 2023Verified Purchase
Had my eyes on this gun for some time and I finally decided to pull the trigger (no pun intended). The price was a bit high for a ""plastic"" gun but I told myself that if the quality was so bad, I will send it back. So I ordered it.Arrived the next day. No assembly required and it is ready to go out of the box. The built quality is very good. It is very sturdy and although I didn't try, I'm sure it can survive if it is being dropped. Accuracy is very good from about 3 feet or less. The one thing to be aware is that the salt can bounce back and possibly hit the eyes so I used safety glasses just as a precaution. Efficiency is about 70%... and by that I mean that even if the fly is hit, the shot doesn't always kill the fly. In any case, the gun does a good job.No, it doesn't come with salt - uses ordinary granulated salt and one fill, gives aprox 80 -100 shots.In closing, there is nothing bad I can say about this ""Salt-a-Bug"" gun and I can highly recommend it to anyone.

A Surprisingly Effective Solution for Pesky Bugs
Reviewed in Canada on April 3, 2024Verified Purchase
When I first heard about Bug-A-Salt, I couldn't help but chuckle at the idea of using a ""salt gun"" to combat bugs. However, my opinion quickly changed after experiencing its effectiveness firsthand during a particularly buggy summer in Northern Ontario.The Bug-A-Salt turned out to be far more than just a novelty item. When the air was thick with bugs and traditional methods of pest control fell short, we decided to give the Bug-A-Salt a try. To our surprise, it worked exactly as described, delivering a satisfying blast of salt that effectively dispatched pesky insects.One of the standout features of the Bug-A-Salt is its simplicity and ease of use. With just a few pumps of the handle, you can unleash a powerful shot of salt that takes down bugs with precision and accuracy. It's a fun and satisfying way to tackle insect problems without the need for harmful chemicals or messy traps.However, I did encounter one minor drawback with the Bug-A-Salt: filling it can be a bit cumbersome. While it's not overly difficult, it does require some patience and dexterity to ensure that the salt reservoir is properly filled. Despite this small inconvenience, I believe that the effectiveness of the Bug-A-Salt more than outweighs any minor challenges with refilling.Overall, I would highly recommend the Bug-A-Salt to anyone dealing with a bug problem, whether it's indoors or outdoors. It's a surprisingly effective solution that delivers on its promise of pest control in a safe and environmentally friendly manner. Plus, it's a fun and entertaining way to tackle insect infestations, making it a worthwhile investment for any household.Pros:- Surprisingly effective at dispatching bugs- Simple and easy to use- Fun and entertaining alternative to traditional pest control methods- Environmentally friendly and chemical-freeCons:- Filling can be a bit cumbersomeIn summary, the Bug-A-Salt is a game-changer for bug control, offering a fun and effective solution to pesky insect problems. While filling may be a bit tricky, its overall performance and effectiveness make it a must-have for any home.

I bought the Bug-A-Salt to combat the problem that a lot of camper owners dispise: Whacking bugs with a fly swatter that smears the remnants of it over the new walls and furniture. Using this item, a very minimal amount of salt is spread out (Not enough that I am worried!) and the bug is easy to clean up afterwards.The build quality seems satisfactory and feels like it will last over time. I like that the aiming sights onloy activate when the Bug-A-Salt is loaded and ready to fire. It is very easy to use, our kids love to take turns being exterminator around the house and camper. The Bug-A-Salt has been a great tool to teach the kids proper firearm safety as well!If you have any friends or family who own campers, this is a great gift idea that they will definitely enjoy!

I've tried many brands available in Canada, both all natural and non all natural typesAs far as non natural type of peanut butters go, this is one of the two best brands.Between this and Jif, it comes down to preference, but other brands just fall short whether in taste or texture.The affordable price, especially in 2kg jars, brings it down to a comparable price point to budget brands.

This is the absolute best crunchy peanut butter I ever eaten! My little dog takes pills and I put it in the peanut butter and she licks my finger clean and begs for more! For humans, it is amazing.....the taste is so good that now when I make a sandwich I eat some right out of the jar; I have never done that with any other peanut butter! Amazing!

This is fantastic peanut butter, are the extra ingredients worth the flavour? Read on to find out.
Reviewed in Canada on November 15, 2019Size: 2 kg (Pack of 1)Style: SmoothPattern Name: Peanut ButterVerified Purchase
This peanut butter tastes excellent, is perfectly smooth and spreads easily. The taste is not to sweat or salty, it is just right. The peanut butter is perfectly consistent, even after being in the fridge for weeks, the oils will not separate and the consistency will remain the same. Peanut butter is very versatile, can be spread on toast, used in cookies, as a dip or even eaten on its own as my wife likes to do.If you take a look at the ingredients list, you will see 7 ingredients. These ingredients are combined to create this perfectly emulsified, great tasting, long lasting peanut butter. In the USA, anything with the label peanut butter has to contain at least 90% peanuts by law, otherwise it is called a ‘peanut butter spread’. In Canada, where peanut butter was invented (Montreal) no such law exists so the consumer does not know how much actual peanuts goes into the product.The second ingredient ‘soy bean oil’ is regarded as a healthy oil and is used to prevent the oils naturally found in peanuts from separating and rising to the top of the jar, like in natural peanut butter.The third ingredient ‘corn maltodextrin’ is a highly processed white powder that is used to thicken the peanut butter, reduce the fat content per serving and keep the texture of the product. It is made from processed corn, has a neutral taste and has less than 20% sugar, however it adds carbohydrates to the servings.The third ingredient is sugar, which most people already know is used to sweeten the peanut butter and improve the taste. Peanuts on their own have zero added sugar obviously (although naturally contains 70mg per 15g). This product adds 1 gram of sugar per 15g of peanut butter.The forth ingredient is hydrogenated vegetable oil. This is used to improve the taste, texture and improve shelf life of the product. In this product they take, cotton seed and rapeseed oil which are liquid at room temperature, and they add hydrogen atoms to it. These types of oil are known to negatively affect heart health, inflammation and blood sugar. So this is probably the worst ingredient in this product. Being listed between salt and sugar, we can assume that there is between 60 and 100mg of this ingredient added per 15g.The fifth ingredient is salt, which improves the flavor and everyone loves salt. Peanuts on their own have less than 3mg of sodium per 15 grams. This product has 60mg of sodium per 15g, so they add around 57mg per 15 grams of peanut butter.The sixth ingredient is mono and diglycerides. This is typically used to help water and oil blend, to improve consistency and texture in the peanut butter. This is created by taking animal fat or vegetable oil and subjecting it to heat and adding an alkaline catalyst in a chemical reaction to isolate these fats. They are generally regarded as safe.15 grams of plain peanuts is 85 calories. 15 grams of this product is 90 calories. So the extra 6 ingredients that are not peanuts only make up about 5 calories per serving. They do however create a very palatable experience. So is the taste of this product worth it to you over natural peanut butter? Let me know.

Taste: Let's start with the make-or-break factor for most protein powders: the taste. The Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor is, in a word, exceptional. It strikes a perfect balance between richness and sweetness, avoiding the artificial or overly sugary taste that plagues many other chocolate-flavored powders. Mixed with water, it's delicious, but with milk, it transforms into a decadent treat that I actually look forward to after my workouts.Mixability: Optimum Nutrition has clearly put significant effort into the formulation of this powder, as it mixes effortlessly with both water and milk, leaving no clumps or residue. Whether I use a shaker bottle or a blender, the result is a smooth, enjoyable shake every time, without the dreaded sandy texture.Effectiveness: Beyond taste and mixability, the most important question is: does it work? Packed with 24 grams of protein per serving, including whey protein isolate as the primary ingredient, it provides the necessary building blocks for muscle repair and growth. I've noticed a marked improvement in my recovery times and gradual increases in muscle mass since incorporating this powder into my regimen. The inclusion of over 5 grams of BCAAs per serving is a welcome bonus, supporting endurance and recovery.Value: While not the cheapest option on the market, the quality and effectiveness of Gold Standard 100% Whey justify the price tag. It's a testament to the adage ""you get what you pay for,"" offering high-quality protein without unnecessary fillers or additives. The 5-pound tub provides great longevity, especially for those who train regularly.Overall: Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard 100% Whey in Extreme Milk Chocolate is a standout product that delivers on all fronts. It offers an unbeatable combination of taste, quality, and effectiveness, making it an excellent choice for anyone serious about their fitness and nutritional goals. Whether you're a seasoned athlete or just starting on your fitness journey, this protein powder is a solid investment in your health and well-being. Highly recommended.

I've been using this Whey Protein Powder for a while now, and I must say, it's a game-changer. This protein powder, especially the Chocolate flavor, is a delight for anyone who is serious about their fitness routine.Taste: The taste is absolutely heavenly. It's like having a guilt-free dessert after an exhausting workout. The chocolate flavor is rich and satisfying, not too sweet, and doesn't have that artificial taste that some other brands have.Mixability: It mixes well with both water and milk, with no clumps or powdery residue. It's smooth and creamy, making it a pleasure to drink. I would say mix it for at least 30 seconds before consuming it.Effectiveness: As for the results, they're noticeable. This protein powder is packed with all the essential amino acids, providing your muscles with the fuel they need to grow and recover.Value for Money: While it might seem a bit pricey, the quality and results make it worth every penny. It's a reliable and effective supplement to any fitness routine.If you're looking for a protein powder that tastes great, mixes well, and delivers results, it is a fantastic choice. It's a 5-star product in my book.

My daughter bought this for herself, so I decided to try it out. With my regular hair dryer, even though I would use a brush and try and dry my hair smooth, it would always end up with a bit of frizz, where I would have to use a curling iron or straightener to finish it off. My hair I would consider a medium thickness...not thin, and not THICK, but with a bit of natural wave to it and shoulder length. When I used the full bristled brush ending with this dryer, my hair was silky smooth, with some great body because of the way I brush-dried it. Honestly was like being at the hairdressers when I leave with silky, healthy looking hair. I LOVE THIS DRYER and need to get one for myself as my daughter is getting married very soon and I will no longer have this dryer available. I honestly don't want to go back to my other dryer. My hair looks so healthy using this. I actually was at my hairdresser's last week (not for an appointment) and she commented on how great my hair looked. I had initially said I need to put this on my Christmas list, but there's no way I can go that many months without it (it's July). Way beyond what I expected. Yes, the $350 is worth it (even though it pains me to pay that much for a hair dryer!)

So the next time I used the blow dryer attachment then the curling attachment. They still didn’t last, but it’s a nicer blow out than straight. I love how the curler works!

Beware ... it does not last unless you ?
Reviewed in Canada on June 9, 2023Style: Concentrator AttachmentVerified Purchase
My initial review was 5 stars as it's a great blow dryer. Then a 1 star review because it started to shut off and on after just 4 months of use. This was really frustrating and should not happen with a product in this price range. Other reviews have also mentioned theirs, having the same issues and or dying in less than a year.  I was feeling so frustrated and decided to contact Shark Customer Service to give them a piece of my mind. To my surprise, an amazing customer service rep DARCY was very concerned with my issue and was able to walk me through and resolve my issue over the phone.  Beware... it does not last unless ... you grip the round intake air grill (at bottom of the handle) squeeze and pull downward to slide over the cord. This exposes the metal air filter which needs to be cleaned at least once every month or two. My filter was almost completely blocked  causing the dryer not to work properly and shut off because of overheating. Shark backs the product up for 2 years from purchase. Thanks Shark and Thank you DARCY.  6 stars !!

First off the packaging was definitely opened prior to reaching me.  Not sure if it was returned or opened in the warehouse but it did not appear to have been used. However, there was a huge blob of heavily scented shampoo on the outer box of the product which had to have been there when it was packaged into the box it was shipped in seeing as that box had residue of this shampoo on the inside of it.  I spent quite a bit of time wiping this off and it wore down the images on the the box by the time I was done.I held off a long time purchasing this product based on price.  It went on a tiny sale so I grabbed it.  I really wanted to love this but it did nothing for me.  I tried it many times, nothing worked; increasing the speed, increasing the heat level, holding the curling wands straight up and upside down, using on damp hair, hair with texture spray, second and third day hair etc.I found my hair consitstently getting caught between the drying attachments and the hand piece.  As for the curling wands, I couldn't even get them to grab my hair so I tried using it on damp hair.  While it did curl lightly and in small sections my hair became a frizzy mess by the time I was done.  Even using it simply as a hair dryer was not strong enough to keep my frizz from getting out of control leaving me to reach for my straightening iron as usual.It is deceptively lightweight until you start to use it and then it's super heavy if you have small hands as I do and cannot get a good enough grip on the hand piece. It is also quite loud and high pitched, I had to use it wearing earplugs.If you have thick hair that gets frizzy easily, this product may not be for you.  While my hair is not exactly short, I also feel you have to have a substantial amount of length to your hair to get whatever curl you can achieve to look decent. I have watched multiple influencers and tutorials of people with longer hair than mine use this product and the results are beautiful.  Sad it didn't work out for me.

I absolutely love the blow dryer and the brush attachments. The paddle brush attachment is perfect for a silky smooth straight look and the round brush is great for a little volume. I find the curler attachments don’t hold very well even with product in my hair prior to curling. I have very thick hair so that could be the reason but I would 100% recommend this simply for the hair dryer itself with the bonus of both the brush attachments!!

This kept all the flyaways stuck to my daughter's head during a dance showcase where she performed three dances and ran around with her friends for hours. It was also easy to wash out with a little shampoo and massage. We had to use a lot of it to ensure the hair was secure, so perhaps it made it more expensive. We liked it and will buy it again.

Reviewed in Canada on April 9, 2024Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
The pails for adult diapers are far more expensive.  This one does the trick and is easy to use.  We put size large products in this pail.  If you try to roll in a ball, they won't fit through the hole.  Just put them in free and they work.  If you have larger product, this may not work.  This is discreet and keeps odour down.

Almost as good as the original
Reviewed in Canada on February 19, 2024Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
I had the original diaper genie for the past 4yrs but the lid broke off and it was time to replace it. I got this newer version and at first glance everything seems great but its slightly ""cheaper"" than the original. The plastic seems a little thinner and there is no longer a button that is keeping the diaper bag compartment closed, it's just a pull system that bends the plastic to the point it unhooks and opens. I was happy with the original and it did last quite a long time considering we use it everyday. I'm hoping this one lasts just as long.

An Echo Upgrade for My Home Office
Reviewed in Canada on August 23, 2023Colour Name: CharcoalConfiguration: EchoVerified Purchase
Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)I recently added the Echo (4th Gen) to my home office, and I must say, it's been a fantastic addition. This isn't my first Echo device, and I'm confident it won't be my last. Here's why I love it:**Sound Quality (★★★★★):**The sound quality of the Echo (4th Gen) is truly impressive. Whether I'm listening to music, having a conference call, or simply asking Alexa for information, the sound is clear, crisp, and fills the room beautifully. It makes working from home a much more enjoyable experience.**Voice Recognition (★★★★★):**One of the standout features of this Echo is its exceptional voice recognition. Alexa understands my commands and questions perfectly, even in a room with some background noise. It makes managing tasks and controlling smart devices in my office a breeze.**Tech Support (★★★★★):**As an experienced Echo user, I've rarely needed tech support. However, it's reassuring to know that Amazon provides excellent customer support for its devices. Should any issues arise, I'm confident they will be resolved promptly.**Smart Home Hub (★★★★★):**The Echo (4th Gen) doubles as a smart home hub, which is incredibly convenient.

It's a versatile and high-quality smart speaker that offers a lot of value for the price. If you're a fan of Echo devices like I am, you won't be disappointed with this one.

Just received my echo today, it actually arrived early! Was a breeze to set up with the downloaded alexa app. I recommend watching YouTube videos about the device and what you want to disable...for example you can disable the function of saving alexa interactions or choose a time period of deleting them...doing this is a great privacy feature.My original choice of echo devices was the echo studio for the sound loudness but I was reluctant to spend $250 before taxes. This echo 4th gen is the next best thing for soundcloudness and quality, especially when you adjust the treble, bass and mid-range to your preference. Excellent bass sound! Totally happy with this item!I will likely purchase another or save up for a studio to connect with it for a kick a** system!

A few things could be improved
Reviewed in Canada on December 3, 2022Verified Purchase
I like Alexa devices in general ... I have at least 7 in my home ...This being said ..# Stereo pairingI tried pairing this one with my older echo to have stereo when listening to spotify but it was a bit complicated even for an IT guy.The problem was that 1 echo device was on the 2ghz band and 1 was on the 5ghz band.So Alexa complained that there were not on the same network but it's the same SSID and I think it should work fine anyway since they share the same network somehow.The workaround I found was to go in my router settings, use mac filtering to block my new echo device from 5ghz band.# When using my Samsung phone, Spotify steaming to Alexa does not always work, I press Play and there is no sound. It always works in the end but it's a bit annoying to have to re-try multiple times# There are a few things Alexa has issues understanding, like some songs she can't find on Spotify for no apparent reason, it would be nice to have an easy way to report these so they can get fixed. I tried playing some playlists on Spotify but Alexa would not recognize them. Also for some reasons sometimes we say ""close light XYZ"" (in french) and it won't work, sometimes it does. Sometimes we say ""turn of light XYZ"" instead and this works. It's not consistent.# When there is a power outage, often some lights can't be found by Alexa but they work in Kasa/Govee/etc. The workaround is to re-plug the plugs and to reset the switches but it's a bit annoying.# In the Alexa app, often when we add a device in a group, it removes another device from that group# There were notification sounds that we did not know why we got them and it was a bit annoying. Eventually I realized that it was when there was a ""deal"" on Amazon. I disabled it using the Alexa App and it seems fine now but I think this should be improved. Indeed, when I asked Alexa what why Alexa made a sound. she was not able to provide an answer. When looking at the history in the Alexa app, there was nothing about that ""event"". I think it's when I finally asked ""do I have notifications?"" that I was able to understand what was that sound. I think this should be replaced by Amazon Store alerts instead or on the phone notifications instead. Something you can look at instead of listening to. Visual instead of audio.# Sound is OK as long as you don't crank it up too much, I might buy the Echo Studio eventuallyUpdate 2023 : the alexa app on android is really due for a refresh, i have maybe 20 alexa supported devices in my house and the app feels quite outdated and slow, managing groups and rooms among other things can be quite painful .. troubleshooting network issues should also be improved

This is my first Echo. (I also have 3 Echo Dots). Although the sound and speaker on the Dot is acceptable, the sound from this Echo is even better - deep bass, wider range and you can really notice the difference the separate tweeters and woofer make. This was successfully set up on my Wifi and integrated with my other Amazon devices in Alexa within 5 minutes out of the box. I put this Echo in a large room and moved one of my Echo Dots into a smaller room. They all work seemless together.  Highly recommended.

The best I’ve used
Reviewed in Canada on January 26, 2024Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I purchased the Momentum 4s in a head-to-head comparison against the Bose QC 45 and the Technics EAH800. The Momentum had by far the best sound profile and superior eq adjustment via the app. Can connect to multiple sources at once, noise cancelling  during music and on calls only slightly behind the Technics, best in-call acoustics, and weight and build made them suitable to wear during activities.  I wanted headphones that would allow me to have important work calls even with my children making noise in the background and they succeed. I really enjoy the sound profile and find myself using them far more than I anticipated. Being able to toggle the noise cancelling on and off with a tap is fantastic.My single complaint is the headphones occasionally disconnect during calls requiring me to re-select them as the audio source on my phone. Hopefully this is addressed with a firmware update.

Great headphones
Reviewed in Canada on December 17, 2022Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
Shockingly comfortable with a very good neutral sound profile. (probably the best wireless sound quality I've ever heard.) Also has an unbelievable battery life. I only have to charge these every other week at most, even with frequent daily use. The only flaws are with the gimmicky features that try to emulate the Sony headphones that we were all too 'cool' to buy instead.  The touch panels can be finicky in the cold and if you're sweating like the thiccboi/lady that we all are after the lockdowns, the ear sensor can sometimes think that youve taken the headphones off. This will make whatever is playing pause which will then make you have to go through the excruciating motion of tapping them once to play again.These are still borderline perfect headphones, but of course they had to have all the silly nonsense to appeal to the 17 people who talk to Siri...The ANC is solid but it's the one place that the Sony flagship headphones do outperform these. Its not really a feature that I'm hard for, but I guess if you're weirdly excited by it, you should for sure go with the Sony cans. The worst flaw by far is the fact that they took their very creative momentum design and made them look like all the other wannabe sony trendy headphones. Absolutely DEVASTATING for us hipster dorks. While the 10/10 sound quality and comfort does more than make up for no longer looking like a super cool and unique edgelord that ""for sure appreciates music way more and has infinitely better taste than all these other normies"", I did prefer the old design.But yeah. 10/10. Would blow $500 on headphones to listen to cringe podcasts again. Buy them, you won't regret it... And if you do regret it it's okay because you just die anyways. :D

A solid pair of cans in spite of
Reviewed in Canada on February 17, 2024Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
Pros: Nice feel and aesthetic with really impressive sound quality listening to music and engaging in telephone conversation.  Automatic 15 minute shut off when idle is also a nice feature that extends battery life.  The fit on the head and ears is quite comfortable and can also be worn for extended periods of time without any major discomfort.  Active noise cancelling is good to very good at blocking out external noise while the transparency mode is quite transparent in terms of external sounds entering the headphones without taking them off.  The 60 hours of battery life on a full charge, which only takes 2 hours from empty is quite impeccable as well as a quick 5-10 min charge giving me 3-6hrs of playback!  The battery life is bar none the best there is for a Bluetooth headset at this point.  Cons: Bluetooth disconnect occurs more often than I like and the touch controls aren't always responsive but works more often than not.  The on-head detection can also be annoying as even the slightest adjustment of the right earcup will pause play.  You can turn certain features on and off in the app to help curtail some of the issues associated with the Momentum 4.  Another con is that they're not the most comfortable around the neck, although the most ergonomically sound way would be to fully extend the sliders and turn the cups towards the neck/clavicle area soft side down.  They also don't fold like the previous iterations of the Momentum; instead, the earcups swivel 180°  All in all, a solid pair of cans based on the price point which also comes with a decent 2 year warranty from the manufacturer!

Reviewed in Canada on March 25, 2020Platform for display: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase
DO NOT LISTEN TO WHAT ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT ONLINE PLAY, IT ISN'T THAT BIG OF A DEAL. I always loved the feel of animal crossing as a whole, and this game might be my favourite from the entire series. I only ordered the game yesterday and although to some people the game might start off a little slow, the customization options from the start with things like clothing, face paints, and more is really fun to toy around with. When starting off, character customization in terms of hairstyles and eyes, mouth etc. can be limited, but more can be unlocked later on. When starting the game, the player can choose from 4 randomly generated island types, and can also choose the name of the island, 2 other campers also come and live on your island at the start. You also get a native fruit to your island, these can be peaches, apples, cherries, oranges, and pears. These are randomly chosen. Right after starting the game and getting out of the main setup, I had made my sister register inside of the game, which was extremely easy (if they had a nintendo switch account already on the switch they could just load up the game on their account and create their character right away). Yes, only one switch is allowed per island, and this probably wont change. However, I do not see a problem with this at all. Up to 8 residents are allowed on one island at once, and the island size is more than enough for each resident to have their own space on the island. local play between players is also very easily accessible by opening the nook phone and selecting the “Call Resident” app, from there you can select multiple residents to play with together. When playing local play, the game always has a leader, which can do more things than a player, such as going into buildings, the camera follows them, accessing shops, etc. This doesn’t mean the other people playing are left out though, people can still use tools from their inventory, and they can still pickup items (which are stored in a box inside resident services). I don’t these limitations as much of a problem, since changing the leader is extremely easy and just takes a shake of a controller and a button. There is also complaints about the fact that players who aren't the first player registered on the island can’t progress through certain parts of the game, but it has been like that for countless animal crossing games, and it only makes sense since the first person to found that island is basically the leader. Overall it is amazing game definitely worth the wait and price, and I think most complaints are just over exaggerated.

This product is pretty okay. It says use a generous amount when applying BUT I'd recommend way less. It makes your hair quite greasy, especially if you follow the instructions and use it root to end. I use it from neck to ends, just a small dollop, and it makes the hair quite soft. Has a vanilla scent.

I haven't used it yet but heard good things. I opened it and a giant waft of playdoh came at me. The smell is off putting tbh. Even if it's a great product, the smell is strong and really bothers me. I had a hair mask by this brand and I don't use it anymore because it smelled like playdoh and it would linger for days

Seriously the only reason you are browsing reviews for this game is to see what stupid things people will say. Because I highly doubt any younger kids will care at all about this relic and want to actually buy it. And I am sure the collectors don't need any convincing to buy it. Because we already know all about it. So how about you stop wasting your time and go do something useful or take pictures of your cat to put up on the internet?

This bassinet works great for my son, but this won’t be for everyone. 5 stars because the cons aren’t “bad”, they’re just my preferences:PROS:- Easy to assemble and sturdy. It’s not moving easily when you’re getting your baby in and out- The vibration is subtle but noticeable. It puts my son right back to sleep when he is fussing.- the noise/music it makes works well for my son- the light/vibration system works on batteries and is detachable so you don’t even have to have it on there if you don’t want- deep bassinet, when baby starts to roll, there will be no fear of limbs going over the sides- you can turn a light that illuminates inside the bassinet to see your baby. I thought it was too bright for me, but I know some people really like it- stars light up on the ceiling and it’s cute- priceCONS- the vibration and sounds only last 30 minutes, so it’s enough to lull baby to sleep but you need to keep turning it back on or doing a quick “off on” to reset the timer- the mobile doesn’t spin or make noise- the mattress feels a bit like plastic (but if you buy those change pad covers, they work really well!)All in all it’s a great bassinet for the price :)

Giving this bassinet a 6/10Easy to put together, sturdy, my baby loves the vibration and white noise on itHowever , the pad inside is SO thin, it’s rock hard and my baby hates sleeping in there, when he was first born he didn’t mind but around 3-4 weeks he started really fussing and crying every time he was put in it, soon as we added another bassinet pad he seemed to be fineI wish the mobile wasn’t jsut a rod with string ornaments, my baby loves watching things move , the star projector is really cool but my baby has already outgrown the bassinet and was never able to enjoy themThe bottom rack is great for storing blankets, swaddles, diapers and wipes, and seems to be able to fold a bit of weight , my 20lb cat usually sleeps there so 🤷🏼‍♀️Overall a good bassinet, nice to look at, mesh is a plus, but the hardness of the bottom really  made me give a lower review (I know it’s meant to be “hard” but this is hard to the point of discomfort )

But I was willing to take the chance and I’m glad I did because it seems perfect! All the parts seems to be there, box wasn’t damaged at all, and it looks brand new! (No mold!)

Good Bassinet, Surprisingly Great music, sounds, lights, vibrations. Soothing.
Reviewed in Canada on July 19, 2019Style: Soothing MotionsVerified Purchase
This bassinet exceeded my expectations.  Everything about it is very nice. The battery powered unit that you can connect to the bassinet or put on your dresser was the biggest surprise because I expected inane out of tune song snippets to plunk out of it however, they put beautiful nursury music, 2 choices of soothing (even to adults) outdoor sounds and white noise coming through a decent enough speaker. We also did not think we'd use the ceiling light stars but the are really nice too. The unit has vibrations if you like and also has a yellow light facing the inside of the bassinet so you can see baby or do a quiet diaper change. A lot of thought was put into making it very nice.  The bassinet itself is pretty sturdy.  Currently our baby is just a newborn but so far this purchase is a winner.

Great soothing bassinet
Reviewed in Canada on February 2, 2018Style: Soothing MotionsVerified Purchase
We love all of the soothing options this bassinet offers. The music and nature sounds are all quite soothing, and I really like the option for vibration, which sometimes is all it takes to distract our baby from his fusing and get him back to sleep.Also the star projection on the ceiling is very cool, and our baby loves to look at it.The mobile above his head moves really easily, so when he starts kicking and swaying the bassinet sometimes it grabs his attention which is great.  I also really love that I can see him through the mesh sides.It was really easy for me to put it together by myself, it all just snaps together, but it still feels really sturdy.I did end up sewing a softer mattress cover, as the one that comes with the bassinet is quite stark.All in all a great choice, we're really happy with it.

OK for a budget bassinet
Reviewed in Canada on July 26, 2018Style: Soothing MotionsVerified Purchase
I’ve been using this bassinet for the past 11 weeks, and here are my criticisms:- Vibration/music feature auto turns off after 30 minutes. Usually that’s enough to help lull the baby into a deep sleep, but often I find as soon as it shuts off abruptly the baby will notice and wake up. I wish there was a continuous play option.- Yes, it rocks. But you have to sit there manually rocking it, so it’s not really that practical. Because of this, I just rock her in my arms first and then place her in the bassinet, making this feature useless.-The lights feature is kind of lame, just some faint stars on the ceiling that my baby barely notices.- The mobile doesn’t do anything. Having said this, my baby still looks at it and smiles.  It really gets in the way when moving my baby in and out of the bassinet though, so I usually just take it off altogether.- Bulky, heavy frame makes the bassinet difficult to move around- Bassinet mattress is very thin and seems hard/uncomfortable

Everytime I pass near him, I physically need to punch him or slap him really hard.He's pretty robust and have a good elasticity for the skin-like texture. ""Bitch slapping"" him is a lot of fun too. My dogs are barking at it when I throw multiple punch. It's like a crowd cheering me to kill it with my punches and my kicks. Because yeah, you can kick it too, which is super cool and convenient when you want to throw a fit like a 5 years old mad child.10/10 Recommend it.

Putting it together is an absolute nightmare the directions show that the dummy just slides on the post which is not true I’m 180 pounds with all my weight on the dummy shoulders (feet off the ground) and it took for ever to be able to get the bolts in. Other than that it’s very rugged easy to move around my son and I both have the opportunity to do some training. It arrived days before the earliest date it said it was going to arrive. That’s a huge bonus of course.

Good product.  Delivered quickly.
Reviewed in Canada on October 28, 2018Verified Purchase
I used to box at a gym, not competitively, and they had these at the gym.  I preferred these over punching bags but bought a bag instead because of the cost.  My bag is still sitting in my garage, essentially brand new because it was difficult to find a spot to hang it.  My kids love taking a few rounds out of Bob and I use him for part of my cardio and toning work out.  The quality is good just like the ones at the gym and the price is although more than a heavy bag, not too expensive and worth the extra money especially if it's not sitting in the corner of my garage. The only thing I've noticed is that there are 6 screws at the back to attach the body to the post, not all of them seemed to tighten (almost like its stripped because they screw onto plastic).  I may have to keep an eye on the screws and tighten them now and again.  I was careful not to overtighten during installation but other than that potentially being a problem the product is awesome.

Reviewed in Canada on January 8, 2018Verified Purchase
Ok....I read all the reviews before I bought this product, and I am reasonably satisfied. However, it should be emphasized that even though you can fit up to 300 pounds of sand in this device, it is still not going to stay still. If you have this on a wood floor or smooth cement/tile...it will move across the entire room in just a few minutes of punching (I'm a middleweight fighter). If you are one of those guys that can get your bodyweight into serious kicks...especially spinning back kicks, this think is almost unusable for that stuff.....it really won't stay in one spot. As a result, your hardwood floors will take a serious scraping as this thing slides around. I even put 320 lbs of sand in mine...manual says 270. Plus I added 5 gallons of water. So I have over a hundred pounds of extra ballast and still it moves. IN any case, this is still the best of these lifelike punching bags around. And you can absolutely forget about using just water in the base....unless you are a child or small female fighter.

Century Bob loves getting beat up.  He craves it.  He longs for it.  Give it to him!It's amazing how much of a full body workout you can get by punching and kicking.It was really easy to assemble.  The only thing that was tedious (and messy because I didn't have a funnel) was filling it with sand.  It took 7X 25KG bags, and I think there's room for more, but it's not moving as it is.  Buy a funnel with a large top but with a small spout because the hole isn't very large.I'm happy I purchased this over a punching bag.

I have used Spectro facial cleaner in the past - this product worked as I expected it to. It's a face wash for sensitive skin. I have a mix of oily and dry skin which this cleaner doesn't irritate. When used prior to your proper after-care face cream, it's a good product. Arrived on time, undamaged and properly sealed. I appreciated the extra seal Amazon put on the top of the bottle to prevent it from accidentally opening during delivery.

I was very impressed. Probably the only minor thing I could possible nitpick for improvement would be the handle mid-level screw could use a lock...but honestly, barely noticed it.

I was happily surprised that I do not sneeze at all after using this brand. You get a lot of product in the bottle.

I recently purchased Affresh Washing Machine Cleaner, and I am incredibly impressed with the results! This product is an absolute game-changer, and I'm excited to share my positive review on Amazon.After noticing a strange odor coming from my washing machine and experiencing slightly dingy clothes, I decided to give this cleaner a try. The results were astonishing! With just one cycle using Affresh, my washing machine smelled fresh and clean, and my clothes came out looking brighter and revitalized.The process is simple and convenient. I just had to drop one tablet into the washer drum and run a regular cycle on the hottest water setting. The cleaner effectively dissolved any residue, limescale, and build-up that had accumulated over time, leaving my washing machine looking and smelling like new.I appreciate that Affresh is a trusted brand, and their cleaner is specially formulated to tackle the unique challenges of washing machines. It's reassuring to know that I'm using a product specifically designed for this purpose, and it gives me confidence in its effectiveness.Each pack comes with three tablets, providing me with multiple uses to keep my washing machine in optimal condition. I now make it a regular part of my cleaning routine, using it once a month to maintain peak performance.Not only did it improve the cleanliness of my washing machine, but it also extends its lifespan by preventing potential issues caused by residue build-up. It's a small investment that goes a long way in protecting my appliance and saving me from costly repairs down the road.Overall, I highly recommend Affresh Washing Machine Cleaner to every washing machine owner out there. It's a simple and effective solution to keep your machine running smoothly and your clothes looking their best. You won't be disappointed with the results!

Good Idea - if it works!
Reviewed in Canada on January 16, 2024Size: 1 count (Pack of 3)Verified Purchase
This is a great product idea!  You use your washing machine to clean your clothes and such - why would you not clean your washing machine?  The theory makes sense to me, but to be honest, I'm not positive it works 100% as advertised.  But the bottom line?  I use them now!When you washing machine does a rinse after the wash, does that not mean the machine gets cleaned out too?  Maybe.  But the idea of getting the machine cleaned out with a special product made for just that, is one that I now buy into.  Can I tell the machine is now cleaner?  No.  But, it makes me feel better!Our current washing machine is pretty new - maybe six or seven years old.  It has a ""TubClean"" function, that I have never used.  I assume it uses a hot water rinse of some sort, and to be truthful, I don't know if the manufacturer requires any kind of special chemical to complete their TubClean.  This product may be just the same as some manufacturers chemical clean.So, even though I can't tell you it will clean your washing machine to a ""like-new"" condition, I use the product myself.  The power of advertising!!  It's not too expensive to use, and I only use it every two months.Hope this helps a little.  Bought by me, with my own money.Thanks!

 I was having trouble with our washer and feeling like it wasn’t cleaning our clothes properly and my mum recommended I try a washing machine cleaner. I went on Amazon and found the affresh pods and purchased them. After fully looking at my washer I noticed it actually had a cycle for affresh washer cleaner and thought it was meant to be! The pods are super easy to use they are all individually packaged and easy to open. I would suggest opening the pod inside the washer to make sure nothing spills if one of the pods happens to be alittle broken. I use the pods once a month by just throwing it inside the washer and turning it to affresh cycle or if your washer doesn’t have that a cleaning cycle  and press start. They work perfect and our clothes are noticeably cleaner. I would highly recommend these cleaning pods the pack I got came with three which was perfect to try them out and the price was great! Will be buying more in the future!

Clean up of the pot was also very simple, and easy. No crevices to un-gum, and wiping the interior and around the lid was effortless. There is a handy condensation trap, which didn't end up being needed this time. The stainless steel cook pot is very well made, and has a very thick gauge base, which allows for excellent, even heat diffusion. The manual pressure release / steam valve is easy to use.

 I have been using pressure cooker on stove and gas burners for over 20 years but Instant Pot Electric pressure cooker is much convenient to use. The results were pretty satisfying. The yogurt and cake options worked well too.Unfortunately, the condensation collector is too lose and keeps falling off causing water to spill over my kitchen top. Since the condensation collector is installed opposite to control panel, there is no way to know when it drops off. I think it happens when the lid is opened or closed.Probably, this condensation collector belongs to larger 6 or 8 quart models. Please send me correct condensation collector for 3 quart model.The anti-block shield is too close to the edges of the lid. It does not provide enough space to grip it to pull out for cleaning.

            I have been using pressure cooker on stove and gas burners for over 20 years but Instant Pot Electric pressure cooker is much convenient to use. The results were pretty satisfying. The yogurt and cake options worked well too.Unfortunately, the condensation collector is too lose and keeps falling off causing water to spill over my kitchen top. Since the condensation collector is installed opposite to control panel, there is no way to know when it drops off. I think it happens when the lid is opened or closed.Probably, this condensation collector belongs to larger 6 or 8 quart models. Please send me correct condensation collector for 3 quart model.The anti-block shield is too close to the edges of the lid. It does not provide enough space to grip it to pull out for cleaning.

I'm a new instant pot user. I, admittedly, was never interested in having one before but now that I have it, I want to use it all of the time. I can get rid of the other appliances because this pot does it all.I've never used such an easy pressure cooker before and the list of recipes that you can do in this pot is amazing. I was also pleasantly surprised that this ""display"" unit is not only the ""duo plus"", it's the upgraded version!It was in brand new shape and never used before because, again, it was on the shelf for display which is why I got it at such a great price. I've even encouraged someone who had an instant pot but was too intimidated to use it. As we spoke, I encouraged her to go on Youtube to learn how to use it and to look for recipes because they usually explain how to use the pot for a recipe.The seller was amazingly accommodating. I discovered that it was missing the valve and when I messaged the seller, they immediately sent me the valve within 2 days at no cost. Great seller! Great product!

Better than a Microwave!  The New Way to Cook Nutritious, Quick Meals
Reviewed in Canada on December 19, 2019Size: 6QTVerified Purchase
I have been using my InstantPot every night since I got it, and it has made mealtime so much easier and delicious.I can take almost anything directly out of the freezer and prepare it in minutes and have it on the table in less than an hour, including prep and additional dishes.  It's quicker than going out for dinner, or ordering in, and so much healthier for you.  For example, I can take a roast directly from the freezer, brown the outside in a pan with some olive oil and garlic or onions  (while still frozen) then put the entire contents of the pan into the InstantPot, add a cup or two of water, set the time, and in 35 minutes, have a delicious pot roast ready and on the table.  Want gravy with that?  Set the pot to Saute after removing the vegetables and roast, and make your gravy directly in the InstantPot.  It is so easy to set, and safe to use with it's multiple safety features, you will wonder how you managed without it before.  Just like Grandma's pressure cooker, without the worry of overcooking or over-pressurizing, and it has so many multiple safeguards it's foolproof.  I'm expanding what I'm preparing in it every day, with thousands or recipes online, or in cookbooks dedicated to its use.  Well worth the investment, it paid for itself in less than two meals out.  It's a blessing for last minute guests, hurried days with the family or making weekends more relaxing knowing dinner is only minutes away.  One of the must have gifts of Christmas last year, I waited to get mine, but now I wondered why as it has made such a huge difference in preparing meals.  The best appliance in my kitchen.

Reviewed in Canada on July 31, 2023Verified Purchase
I'm a day sleeper and needed something beside the bed that could cool off my torso area quickly. This little gizmo does the trick. Yes, it's loud on the high setting, but so is my bratty neighbor joyriding around on his dirt bike on summer break, so I sleep with earplugs anyway. I only use distilled water, as was the recommendation. It makes sense as I have heavy water and using the alternative will extend the life of the filter. Glad I didn't buy it on the website of the commercial. I saved over $40 going the Amazon route. It won't cool down a room, but it does the trick in close quarters. Highly recommend. Thank you!

Meh.
Reviewed in Canada on July 18, 2021Verified Purchase
I would invite people who write excellent reviews of this product to load it up with clean water, turn it on, and set it next to a regular fan. The difference is measurable but negligible. When you freeze the pads and put ice in the water the difference is somewhat less negligible. On a very hot day, this effect lasts roughly an hour.The fan in the unit is the cheapest part of the design. In my case, it's out of balance and makes the table shake a little. I expect it to fall apart any day now.Then there's the noise itself. Mine is so loud I can't sleep with it on, which is fine: I use a fan, which works just as well.It will not - Read this: NOT - cool a small room. It will cool a part of a small room, maybe the part you're sitting in. It is not ""air conditioning"": it is a crappy little plastic swamp cooler, and as the design execution is absolutely abysmal that its performance is equally abysmal.Not worth $15, much less this panic price they sent up to accommodate a particularly hot summer.TL;DR: crappy components, crappy design. Not worth it IMO.

It’s better then a fan but it’s high maintenance
Reviewed in Canada on August 18, 2021Verified Purchase
The first machine I got was defective but I got a new one at no charge so that was nice. The device is loud, real loud. If noise bothers you this isn’t for you the motor is quite loud. But I like that so it was good for me. The light always stays on which is a minus personally because I like to sleep in pitch dark. The unit itself throws out cold air but you have to crush ice and mix water in at the top. I always would have icy cold water in my fridge and ice cubes I’d hammered to top it off to keep it cold. Because the filter doesn’t stay frozen long. You could freeze that thing 12 hours and 45 mins later if it’s really hot it’s melted but it’ll work wet too. But make sure to have atleast a wet filter, the colder water on the filter, the better. Also I put peppermint oil on the grate I felt like it helped cool the air down a bit.

Excellent for smaller areas
Reviewed in Canada on July 31, 2022Verified Purchase
I knew from the start that this product was not meant to cool larger rooms. It was designed for smaller, more confined areas like work areas or perhaps a bedroom. I had an older water cooling fan until it quit on me. This product is far superior to that fan. I use it in my home office and have it on my desk facing me. Works like a dream. What I do to keep the water cooler is probably not what the manufacturers want to hear but I do it anyway. When the water level is halfway down I drop a couple of ice cubes into the reservoir. They melt and cool the water, which in turn keeps the expelled air cool.

I’ve kept good care of it and the filter and just won’t work at all. It didn’t keep the area as cool as I thought it would either. For the price, the amount of working time, and work just to have some cool air. So not worth it at all!

I bought this thinking it would be a cost-effective way to cool a small room during the summer months, as I have an elderly cat who I want to keep comfortable when the summer heat strikes. Unfortunately, I tried using both cold ice water AND ice cubes, and neither option provided any sort of meaningful cooling in our space. For all intents and purposes, it was a total waste of money and I would NOT recommend this to anyone. Save your money and buy a fan.

I carefully read through many reviews on this product before buying and decided to try it based on the recommendation of a friend who has one and loves it. I realize that quite a few negative reviews have been written but I have to say that I think this unit works perfectly for what it is meant to be. I put it on my nightstand on warm evenings and it blows cold air all night long to keep me comfortable while I sleep. It is not designed  to cool an entire room or a large area.  I had no problem with any leakage, the noise isn’t bothersome to me at all, it just becomes white noise in the background. I fill the unit with ice cubes and then pour cool water over them to the top. I turn it in and it runs for eight hours or overnight on that one tank full. I’m super happy with this product and as long as you don’t have unrealistic expectations of it’s capabilities you will be happy too.

I think it helps, but I know it doesn't hurt
Reviewed in Canada on May 8, 2023Verified Purchase
I more and more rely on reviews to buy some things I see on Amazon, as a number of things Amazon sells are of questionable quality.  I think some of the reviews of this product are unfair.  Honestly, it does stink, and you have to swallow fast to avoid the taste.  But I know for sure it gives me more energy and blood flow. I'm pushing 50, so I don't expect to bulk up like a 25 year old - and I haven't, but I get through intense workouts 3 times a week with good energy. The label does say something about checking with a doctor, but I haven't and it's been perfectly fine.  At one point when I thought I should stop taking it because I was on my 3rd or 4th bottle, I definitely noticed a decrease in energy.  I think I might have felt a bit of stomach upset at the very start, but it went away within a couple of weeks.  To anyone looking for a supplement to make them bulkier, and immediately fit and trim, you're not going to find - in this or anything else.  But truthfully,  Ageless Male, over time, keeps your energy level strong and keeps another pretty stiff as well.

Incredible value for the money
Reviewed in Canada on February 11, 2024Style: VoyageVerified Purchase
I was lucky to catch a killer deal for this cologne, for under $25 and blind bought it.I've got to say all the fuss about it is true. This is a wonderful cologne, very fresh, masculine and versatile.The opening is an alcohol blast that last only about a minute, and the you get notes of green apple and sea water, all very well balanced and done. Then you start getting soapy notes but not harsh at all. It's the smell of a freshly showered person. On top of that, it is very long lasting on skin, easily over 6 hours. Of course projection decreases over time, but if you wear it in a temperature controlled space like an office, other people are going to be able to smell you pretty much all day.I have owned other economical fragrances that are in the same category as Nautica Voyage (Blue Seduction, Ferragamo Aqua, Black Seduction, just to name a few) that are also nice, but Nautica Voyage is a much better blend and it smells more expensive than it is, in my opinion.Men of any age can pull this, from high school kids to mature men, this is a great choice for daily wear, in an informal setting and even for summer time dates. Definitely not for special occasions when you are dressing up, or when you want your presence to be noticed.

Excellent value for money, but still a very cheap budget scent.
Reviewed in Canada on January 16, 2024Style: VoyageVerified Purchase
This is a classic for a reason. At 30$CAD regular price, it is still a steal. It is a very inoffensive scent you can wear almost anywhere but I would say only in the warmer months. The main notes are green apples and algae so it is very fresh smelling.However, you still get exactly what you pay for. This is a very cheap and rudimentary scent without a lot of layers or complexity. The longevity is also terrible - maybe a couple of hours at best. As soon as you have tried a few of the designer scents this has no reason to leave the bathroom. I throw it in my gym bag to use after a workout or saunaDon't buy it unless you have a specific purpose in mind for it where the quality of scent and longevity don't mean much. If you want something that says ocean or beach, look for Salt Air from Skylar. This has gotten me multiple compliments, and I think it captures the beach vibe much better than this does.

Reviewed in Canada on November 12, 2020Verified Purchase
I love this detox. I’ve been doing it 2x - year for the past 4 years (so about every 6 months). I find it really helps reset my body. I feel healthier by about the 3rd day. There are lots of food you can eat and it’s just a matter of taking the pills and drops 2x daily. I also get into better eating habits and drinking more water. I don’t use this for weight loss and I don’t weight myself before or after, but I’m sure I loose a few pounds based on how my clothes fit. But no more bloating and my digestion, skin, energy level all get a boost from this. I have recommended this to friends and family and they’ve experienced the same positive results as well.

Great cleanse for everyone ! Highly recommend
Reviewed in Canada on January 30, 2017Verified Purchase
I am on Day 7 of this cleanse. I do really like it because it is so easy - just take the herbal pills in the morning and at night in addition to following the food guidelines (which really aren't as hard to follow as you'd think - basically just no high sugar foods, wheat or dairy!). My body's reaction to the cleanse has been quite mild, however, I am not a first time cleanser so that may be why. I do go to the washroom maybe 2-3 times per day but it's nothing insane, nor did I get any headaches/nausea. I did, however, on the 3rd and 4th day experience extreme fatigue and low energy overall in the later morning/early afternoon before my body adjusted. Other than that I have felt perfectly fine and because of the meal guidelines I feel healthy and less bloated and light. I have dropped around 3 lbs so far not that its the main idea behind the cleanse but still.

Reviewed in Canada on February 1, 2023Verified Purchase
I finished my cleanse last Friday and am feeling great! It really helped me cut down on sugar cravings and just kick-start better eating more consistently.I had started to cut out many of the things days before the cleanse to make it a bit easier which I think helped. I didn't run into the day 3-4 difficulties I know many go through.I lost almost 7 lbs, and my skin is looking and feeling great. I wouldn't say that it improved my sleep but that could be because of other factors. Another difference I noticed was that I was feeling much stronger and had more energy during my workouts. I think I will get into the routine of doing this 2x / year as many do.Snacks that really helped me when I needed something outside a meal:- Apples and Almond Butter- Popcorn with a bit of herbamare- Cucumbers with herbamare or everything but the bagel seasoning- Chia pudding with frozen berries & almond/oat milk with lemon zestFavourite meals:- Poke bowl with brown rice, tuna, edamame, chopped zucc, peppers, red onion, corn, cilantro- Taco bowls with brown rice and chopped zucc, peppers, red onion, corn, cilantro, lettuce

Main reason i have not yet attempted to OC this chip is because alot source said even the platform for this chip recommends not to OC the Chip, due to damaging the chip faster but dont they all say the same thing for every chip.. but OC at ur own Risk I guess but its a 10/10 for me and if u install this chip an you get a encrypted key error to Press y or N, for your bios Keys Press Y an your good to go.. i overthink the process thinking i was going to completely brake my pc. but either or answer is correct and still boots but the N answer just reboots u right back to the black screen asking u the same answer. the right answer ended up Being the ""Y"" botton so go ahead and press that for me and enjoy your CPU <3.

It does run hot if you don't have a 360MM AIO, but if you use PBO2 and undervolt all cores by -25 you're good to go and it won't hit 60c while gaming. It made gaming waaaaaaaay smoother, I don't even notice any fps drops. This thing is awesome, worth the price, buy it.

The first CPU I bought arrived in a sealed box with bent pins, making it unusable. I returned the CPU via mail and waited for nearly a month without a response, until I finally reached out directly. Only then was I shipped out a new CPU, which did, thankfully, arrive intact.

He says the graphics are so much more realistic and I’ve noticed that the controller (the stock one the console comes with) is an upgrade too, the voiceovers are clear and it’s more interactive.  When you do a burnout the controller feels like how your steering wheel would irl.

I've never owned a Sony console before, I've always used a Nintendo switch (which I still love). I've been wanting a ps5 since the original came out but I'm so glad I ended up having to wait. I actually didn't know this specific one was a newer release. But I'm so glad I ended up with this one instead of the original. I started paying hogwarts legacy on switch but hated the quality so I was super stoked to play hogwarts legacy on ps5, it's been an amazing experience this time around! The new spider man game, I was skeptical since I haven't played any of the others. As a newbie I play on the easiest modes I can, combat and fps aren't my strong suite and not usually the type of games I go to but the spider man combat is actually pretty fun (even on easy mode). Even on easy, I find the combat difficult but thats just a me thing!It arrived in great condition, the ps5 box was inside a box so it didn't get damaged. I've been using my console for almost a month now and I have 0 complaints. I have a bunch of games and still have storage left, I do plan on upgrading the sdd however but for internal storage, 1TB is amazing!

Again, not all pizza ovens have this, but this is a winner.Next, the very fast preheat time and that it can reach 800oF.  It took only 10 minutes to get to full heat.  When it's reached the red lights go out and we're ready to go.Baking for me was only 5 minutes and the pizza turned out perfectly.  The bottom crust was crisp and nicely browned, the top was perfect.This morning I made a tuna melt on some homemade bread.  I set it to 600oF and put it on parchment paper.  That wasn't a useful idea as the paper that extended past the bread burned, but no big deal.I have always made my homemade pizzas in my wall oven at 550 on a pizza stone.  That required preheating the stone for almost 50 minutes and then baking was around 8-10 minutes.  This little oven does it all in 1/4 of the time and does it perfectly.I understand why this pizza oven is a best seller.  The features are terrific and the cook has full control.  Highly recommended.Oh, and they also offer a free one-year warranty with registration.  Bravo to Piezano!

It works!
Reviewed in Canada on February 8, 2024Style: Pizza OvenVerified Purchase
Very easy to use and professional results. With an easy to use machine like this one, you will never order pizza again. It is fun, and the results are amazing. I have tried one working with wood pellets, and it was never as easy or simple as this one. You just adjust the temperature control on top and bottom and that's it . Don't forget to put semolina on the bottom and it won't stick. The accessories (included) are useful. Great value compared to the other pizza ovens. The only other electric pizza oven that could reach this high temperature is the Breville which is almost 9 times this price.

Good 12 in counter top pizza oven
Reviewed in Canada on January 28, 2024Style: Pizza OvenVerified Purchase
This appliance is very efficient for baking a single 12 in diameter pizza and has independently controlled upper and lower heating elements for ensuring good results depending on crust thickness and toppings. I like the viewing window on the top to determine the best cooking time and when to turn the appliance off. Although the appliance comes with 2 bamboo laminated leaves for transferring the pizza to and from the cooking  surface I prefer to use a separate light metal tray to ensure efficiency and safety. The cooking surface in the appliance is not suitable for cutting the cooked pizza with a metal wheel and the pizza must be transferred to a separate ceramic wheel to cut and serve. Overall, I find the cooking oven very good for making a pizza for two and have had really good results so far (10 pizzas). I have found that the cooking time for a thin crust pizza, made from scratch, is about 4.5 minutes and I do not open the oven during baking. I also have a really good pair of oven mits which I think you need when opening the appliance to transfer the pizza to and from the oven.

Wasted  my money on this (CORRECTION)
Reviewed in Canada on February 9, 2024Style: Pizza OvenVerified Purchase
No amount of scraping the stone to clean it reduces the smoke Piezano produces when cooking a pizza.  After using it three times - and three strikes and you're out - I will never use it again.  I will add that it makes excellent tasting pizza but having to steadily, non-stop fan this machine, as my kitchen still fills with smoke, isn't worth the effort.UPDATE! I decided to give Piezano one last try and discovered that the problem wasn't with this product.  The problem was ME! I wasn't scraping the stone as thoroughly as I should have and, even though I pressed down on the pizza, it was still touching the elements.  No wonder Piezano was smoking.  If I'd followed the directions to the letter, as I did over the weekend, I would have had the pizza that Piezano is designed to make.  There was NO smoke and 6 minutes later I had a perfect pizza.  I've changed my rating to 5 stars and now and want to highly recommend Piezano!

Great product, Amazing customer service
Reviewed in Canada on November 12, 2020Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I took 3 months to write this review after using the product every alternate day these 3 months. I must say that this product is truly amazing and helps relieve aches and pains and as well relax muscles. During COVID we were hesitant to go in for physiotherapy and hence decided to give this product a try. Boy, I must say what a difference it made on day 1 of use. Now I feel bad I should have ordered this earlier.My wife has planter faciitis and used to get immense pain every morning. 1 month of regular use of this product and she hardly has sore feet. For this alone I would've given it 5 stars.When my dad, who is 70 years visited us he had a frozen shoulder and I asked him to try it out. We used it once and his muscles were so relaxed he could lift his arm immediately. We got another one for him and he is so happy with it.It is robustly built, has the perfect weight not to hurt your hands while providing firm pressure while massaging. It has enough power to penetrate the deep tissue as well as the speed options are great to adjust intensity of the massage. It is super quiet in operation, I use it at times when the kids are asleep in the same room, Battery life is great, if I use it daily for 15 mins for a week, I just to charge it once. Carrying case and all the attachments are very useful.Now for the icing on the cake: I did reach out to customer support for an issue I had, I must say I was totally impressed with their responsiveness and professionalism to resolve the issue. They were very helpful and totally stood by their product. Totally impressed. I would rate the customer service  5/5.Overall I recommend the product.

I'm giving it a 4 because it makes a slight clacking noise when not pressed up against the body but other then that the operation is very smooth.

Too good to be true (but it IS true)
Reviewed in Canada on October 27, 2020Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Easily the best purchase i've made in a really long time, here's my likes and dislikes:Likes:-The battery life is 3 hours according to the manual, but i've used it every day since I received it and It's still on 7/10 of battery. Make sure you charge it before you use and not to let it run out completely. That being said, you only really need to use it max 3-6 mins at a time, so 3 hours will last you a LONG time.- The manual is super descriptive, it gives suggested 'exercises' as in reps and times for each muscle group and it's quite easy to use. Honestly, you play with the settings a few times and you get the hang of it -super intuitive.- Amazing for passive recovery.  I  don't think you should completely use this item to replace stretching, still stretch and do your warm-up sets...but this helps when you start getting tense during your workouts,before your workouts, and after your workouts. I use 1 attachment (flat head) to relax my muscles after doing my initial stretches, and (not always) use it during my workout.  However, the best application of this is post workout, post stretches, and when you're just sitting watching a show or chilling with the fam, and you pull this out and begin to use it on the muscle group you just worked on.-  it has a wide variety of attachments for various muscle groups. My favorite is the deep-tissue one - it digs deep and gets at those pesky muscle knots. I work in front of a screen all day, and enjoy playing video games, but have terrible posture. This has helped my lower back pain immensely.Dislike: Very little. Not out of bias just only thing i would add to this product is a bit of a mesh on the vent above. I have a lot of huskies and they shed like no-tomorrow. However, if you keep it in it's case and make sure to take care of it, you wont have to worry about this.  Otherwise, i haven't really come across any negatives to it. If you can afford it, and are serious about muscle recovery and working out, this is definitely a great buy.

This massage gun is money well spent
Reviewed in Canada on March 31, 2024Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I had a really bad accident years ago that took years to recover from and a PT advised I buy a massage gun.  It was good advice, and money well spent.  I've been using my Wattne since 2021, and used it almost daily for upwards of a year.  It's been particularly helpful to release tension from my traps.  My shoulders were permanently tensed all the time, causing me headaches and lending to my anxiety and using the Wattne for just ten minutes of applied pressure and massage helped me release.  It's been helpful too for releasing my hamstrings that were siezing and cramping during exercise.  Night time charlie horses happened often too.  I've recommended the Wattne to friends and family, and would recommend it to anyone who resonates with what I've described.

Reviewed in Canada on December 15, 2018Verified Purchase
I really love these headphones. They sound excellent. I also have a set of Bose QC-35s and they're excellent too. The Bose noise cancelling headphones do an incredible job of cutting out the background noise. They're especially great on airplanes. You feel much more refreshed at the end of the flight if you've been wearing them for most of the trip. They cut out all the background airplane noise.  Best of all, they're light and comfortable. And the QC-25's still work even if the batteries run out. That's the best part.

Reviewed in Canada on March 27, 2015Verified Purchase
Wow. Amazing.  The noise canceling is awesome.  I bought to wear at work where my desk is under an HVAC system - i.e. noisy. These headphones cut out the drone and let the clarity of the music or talk show radio come through.  The headphones are bright.  Don't expect mind numbing bass. Good quality low end but may not suit all if thumping bass is high on your need list. Can be used just as noise canceling or just for listening without noise canceling. Used mic in the cord for a telephone call with the headphones. Fairly good mic sound quality.  Overall,  highly recommend these for noise canceling situations. These are not inexpensive but are worth the cost.

Extremley Comfortable with Excellent Noise Cancellation
Reviewed in Canada on April 6, 2015Verified Purchase
Ive tried a a couple of noise cancelling headphone before I bought these. The bose qc15's and Harman Kardon Noise Cancelling headphones. Both were very good in terms of comfort and noise cancelling. I tried these and have been using them for last 5 weeks and I can say they are much better in just about every aspect. I can easily wear them for more than 6 hours continously without any problems. I wear prescription glassses and dont experience any problems when using these headphones. Also my ears dont get hot like they used to with bose qc15's or the Harman Kardons. The noise cancelling is superb, they block out alot more noise then the other two models I owned. The headphones are also the lightest of the 3 headphones. The sound quality is much improved from the previous qc15 model. They sound more balanced now, with just the right amount of bass and treble. I like the fact that I can still use these headphones even when the battery runs out, although the noise cancelling wont work. The only thing I can say that I noticed that is different from the qc15's is that these headphones dont come with a second cable and there is no longer a switch for high or low noise cancellation. I also like the new look and improved built quality of the qc25. I highly recommend these to any one who spends a long time listening to music or travels alot, you wont be disappointed.

The Noise Cancelling is amazing.
Reviewed in Canada on June 11, 2015Verified Purchase
Before these, I used Sennheiser NoiseGard on ear noise cancelling headphones. They worked somewhat, but nothing like these Bose over ear Noise Cancelling headphones. I travelled to Australia and back with these and they made a huge difference. On the final leg of my flight back home, I had a 3 year old girl with her mom sitting beside me. The 3 year old was not happy and she did her fair share of screaming. I just put these headphones on and turned up my music a little and it was like she was in a whole other section. I am so happy with these. Some have commented on the low end not being great, but for me, they were fine. I don't like having my music very loud, because I have sensitive hearing, so more base would likely be less enjoyable for me. One reviewer commented that his ears were larger and so he would have sore ears after a while. Although I wouldn't consider my ears large, I did notice that having them on constantly during a 12 hour flight, my ears did get slightly sore. However it was manageable.One thing I do find a bit of an inconvenience, is the size of the Airline adapter, which I needed to use on the Qantas flights. It sticks out farther than I would like. I actually broke mine on the flight back when I went to sit back down in my window seat. I have replaced it and even bought an extra. But I will have to remember to unplug the adapter from the chair before I get up from my seat. It would be nice if they made it more compact. I tried other airline adapters that are for stereo headphones, but they don't work, since the cable is designed with a microphone connection.I have a Samsung phone and at the time I purchased these, there was only the Apple version of these headphones available. (For the inline volume.) I decided to take a chance when Bose came out with the Samsung version and I ordered a replacement Samsung cable. It worked! So now I have one set of headphones with two cables that I can use on my iPad or my Samsung phone. So if you bought one version and want to use it on the other, you only have to purchase the appropriate cable from Bose.Dec 17, 2017 Update:I still take these on every flight I take. One other piece of information that could be useful to some. I sometimes need to take short haul flights on twin propeller planes and the engines on them are very loud. Before I had these, I tried using my Sennheiser headphones on these planes and they just weren't up to the task. They actually introduced their own noise, so I just reverted to using ear plugs on these flights. The Bose do much better than I would have expected. They don't reduce the sound as well as they do on a jet, but they reduce it from a deafening sound, to something more manageable. I wear them from the moment the engine starts to the moment the engine stops and my ears are much happier for it.

Works extrenely well
Reviewed in Canada on September 20, 2017Verified Purchase
This noise cancelling (NC) headphone works really well.  I'm impressed.  Definitely gets rid of A/C fan noise as the room becomes silent with these headphones on with the NC turned on.  It will even cut down louder voices.  I tested by turning up the TV volume to a very loud sound level.  Although you can still hear what they're saying, the volume is cut down significantly.  But this is with the TV volume turned up very loud.  I normally do not listen to the TV at these high volumes.  There's no point to it unless you are hard of hearing.  For loud speech, it cuts down the volume significantly especially if the source of the noise is a bit further away.  You can barely hear it, it becomes muffled and low and with a radio attached on very low volume, talk radio or even music, it cuts out just about all the external sounds.  I never knew noise cancelling headphones were this good but they are, at least the Bose QC models.Also tried the Bose QC15 and it works equally well to cut down outside noise.  Bose QC15 or QC25; both are worth it.  Both are very comfortable.  I chose the QC25 because it has a more rectangular case and if the battery should fail you can still use the headphones to listen to the radio whereas with the QC15, the battery is required to use the headphones to listen to the radio.

Don't let the price scare you away. Sometimes you have to pay a little extra for quality. Not like those cheep China ones you see advertised on here that break after a few uses. If you have a MacBook you do not have to buy the bluetooth adapter, however if you are wishing to use with a Windows OS you will need to purchase the Bluetooth adapter separate. I love the fact that my Fiancé and I can have fun when he is away on business trips on the other side of the world.

My wife loves it. It’s replaced all her other vibrators and toys at this point. She loves to use it on her own and enjoys finding new patterns. It’s great for foreplay as you can vary the speed and intensity. I initially thought it might feel odd to use my phone to pleasure my wife while I was right next to her, but it was a lot of fun and a big turn on. Good range on the wireless, easy to clean, and easy to operate without a phone. Doesn’t come with a storage case or bag so something to keep in mind.

Best product for removing nose mucous
Reviewed in Canada on April 10, 2024Verified Purchase
This works so much better than traditional bulb suckers. The quality seems a bit flimsy, but it’s held up great after countless uses and washes. There’s a bit of a mental hurdle to get over (the idea of sucking snot out of your baby’s nose is a bit gross), but after using this hundreds of times, there’s no actual risk of getting anything nasty in your mouth. The design of the tube and straw eliminate that altogether.The shape of the tip of the aspirator is great in that can’t go too far up the nostril to cause pain or discomfort. My daughter never seems to mind when I use the about sucker to clear her nose.

Would be good IF
Reviewed in Canada on August 2, 2022Verified Purchase
The concept for the product is good. The tip of the tube goes into babies nose but it is fat so it can really go so far up and no more so no real concern about hurting baby. You have to press on the alternate nose you are not sucking out of to create a seal and then suck away. When done properly it works BUT this unit falls apart. the base of the tube constantly falls off. It does not ""click in"" and stay. I would never buy this again as i see too many other people with the same reviews. Would love to love it BUT if it were sturdy maybe i would have. Additionally, its very difficult to suction a baby unless he is dead asleep. Mine twists like a galloping horse the moment he sees it because he knows what's coming. A useful tip with any aspirator is to loosen the mucus with saline spray or drops as well

It’s fascinating to see the different strategies each player adopts, making each game unique.The build quality of the game is sturdy, with colorful pieces that are easy to handle and a durable game board. This durability ensures that the game can withstand frequent use, a crucial factor for a family favorite.Blokus is also a great social game, encouraging interaction and friendly competition.

Speaking of which....So I'm always asking my husband (a dear man who just walked by) to tell me (for he has amazing close up vision for some reason I don't really understand but I digress) which is the right or left one.  He says he's going to mark them for me but once my toes are straight I may sell them...  I kid, I kid.  I may kick him in the butt though for laughing at me.Oh... they have truly helped.

            Received One piece for the right side only, after opening it up found it to be defective with bad stitching allowing the metal support to come out. The video for this item showed something of better quality in different packaging. I feel a bate and switch was made this was total junk.

I have bought these heavy duty ones to wear mainly in the evening. You can certainly feel these working on you toes. I don’t wear them with shoes as they are a bit bigger than the others I have. Expect to feel a little pain the first few times you use these.

Relieves foot discomfort.
Reviewed in Canada on June 27, 2022Verified Purchase
Almost a year ago I went to my doctor due to foot pain. An x-ray revealed that I was starting to develop a bunion. Within a few weeks of diagnosis I began wearing this corrective brace, and while my bunion cannot be fully reversed, the alignment this brace provides has significantly reduced my discomfort. I've been using this product for nearly a year and it's still in very good condition. I feel it was a worthwhile purchase.

Good but not the best
Reviewed in Canada on June 8, 2023Colour Name: WhitePattern Name: MouseVerified Purchase
I've been using this mouse 8+ hours a day for 6+ months so let me give you the run down. Yes, it's a good mouse. Feels slightly small, though others say it's a good size so that could just be me. Not rechargeable but the battery lasts months. And that's with it being in use for 8+ hours a day, 7 days a weeks, so if this is just for little use that battery could last you a year. It's easy to clean. It has a very smooth surface and any grime that may get on it is easy to get off. However, it lags. It might be the model software since it is an older model, but I play video games and it NOTICABLY stops working for around 3+ seconds, making it look like I'm lagging, but really my mouse is just frozen. This happens to me daily, sometimes multiple times a day. Maybe I'm lucky but it seems to happen at the perfect times. Seriously, I'm not being sarcastic. It hasn't bothered me much at all. But if that sounds like it would bother you, just look into a newer model from Logitech, because physically the quality is top notch.

Way better than an iPhone 7
Reviewed in Canada on February 26, 2023Verified Purchase
I got it a few days earlier than expected and when I took it out of the box, it looked absolutely brand new! Although it did have some barely noticeable scratches on the side, but as I said, BARELY NOTICEABLE. And when I put a case on it you can’t even see them. I would love to thank the seller since it’s exactly what I was looking for. I am a bit disappointed that it came with 91 percent battery whereas I saw a review with someone that got 98 but that’s just me being greedy I guess. This is a huge upgrade over my old iPhone 7 and everything works like new as expected. Thank  you so much for this great product.

So far so good
Reviewed in Canada on April 5, 2024Verified Purchase
Ok, so I've been using the refurbished iPhone for a few days now, and overall, I'm quite happy with its performance.Initially, I was hoping for a gently used iPhone Xs, but the device I received appeared brand new, which was a good but wondered if it been rebuilt with knock off parts. The battery health showed 100%, with no warning messages about it not being a genuine Apple battery, which was a relief.One thing that caught my attention was the display. Compared to my previous iPhone 6s, the screen on the refurbished iPhone X initially seemed off when displaying a white background. It had a slight grey/blue tint, unlike the true white of the 6s. Upon comparison with my wife's stock iPhone X, I realized that it might have a third-party screen. However, despite this discrepancy, the screen works perfectly fine, and I haven't encountered any issues with it.Considering the price and overall functionality, I'm inclined to give it a 5 out of 5 rating so far. While it may or may not have all original Apple OEM parts, it performs well, and I'm happy with my purchase for now. If you're in the market for a budget-friendly iPhone option, this refurbished model is definitely worth considering.Update: 10 days after receiving, the phone works as hoped and the battery is still at 100 percent health and lasts the entire day with my usage. So no regrets so far.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I am an admittedly terrible cook when it comes to traditional means of using a stove and I imagine that my cooking is a slight step up from eating canned dog food, but the Instant Pot has entirely changed this.This thing is friendly for cooking dummies like myself.  There are tons of delicious recipes online that are easy to follow and once everything is in the pot, you simply start a timer and that's it. Once the timer is done, open the valve to release the steam and once the steam has released, dinner is served. There is literally nothing to screw up during the cooking process; it's simple and ingenious.The Instant Pot works by using pressure from steam to significantly shorten cooking times meaning more time for you to do other fun things like hanging out with your significant other, or watching TV, or both!  We've made 'fall off the bone' ribs in about 45 mins (including creating the sauté and taking into account warming up and steam release) that were comparable in taste to ribs that had been slow cooked for 4 hrs. We've also used it to make homemade soups as it takes much less time for the flavour in the ingredients in the soup to trickle into the soup vs traditional boiling over a stove. Chicken in ten minutes? You bet. Perfectly cooked hard boiled eggs in under 5 minutes and delicious cheesecake in under an hour (including steam release) were all no problem for even a simpleton like myself to make, and best of all, everything actually tastes great too!!  I've included pictures of a few of the things we've made using the Instant Pot.  Yes, all of the food pictures in this review were made using the Instant Pot!When it comes to cooking, there aren't too many things out there that are game changers, but an air fryer, a sous vide and an Instant Pot are, and if you happen to have all three, congratulations for having the trifecta of cooking greatness in your kitchen!PROS* So easy to use that even guys that literally can't cook (me) can look like a rock star. Once everything is in the pot, you set the timer and go. Once it's done, open the valve to release the steam and dinner is served. There literally is nothing to screw up and best of all, the food is delicious!* The Instant Pot significantly shortens cooking time of most things, freeing up your valuable time to do other fun things! :P* There are literally tons and tons of delicious recipes online. Guaranteed you will discover there are things that you can make in the Instant Pot that you never knew could be made in an Instant Pot.* Goodbye slow cooker. That was so the 70's.* Easy to clean. The pot is stainless steel and the lid can be removed and fully submerged. The seal on the lid comes off and replacement seals for the lid can be purchased when it eventually wears out.CONS* Too many models just make for mass confusion.  Have a look at my TIPS section for some help.* Expensive, so wait for a sale if you can as they do on sale, especially for big events like Boxing Day, Black Friday, etc.TIPS* Don't get too caught up with the ""x-in-1"" features. They just add a preset cooking time for a type of food to the Instant Pot and up the ""in-1"" number. You can just manually input the cooking time yourself.* The most important thing is determining the size of the Instant Pot that you need. For our family of 4, we went for the 8 quart esp. since the wife likes to make home made soups.* The Lux model does not have low pressure cooking while Duo models have both high and low pressure. Low pressure cooking is typically used to make delicate foods like yogurt, eggs and veggies. If you don't think you'll make yogurt, eggs or veggies in the Instant Pot, just get the Lux model which skips the low pressure. Pro tip: Cooking rice uses high pressure.* Take the Instant Pot outdoors to release the steam when doing a quick release or it will quickly smell up the house of whatever you're making. Use a glove or mitt to be safe.* When making a lot of food, esp. soups, mind the max line. If you want less chance to have a mess on the bottom of the lid, go an inch under the max line.* Be careful when releasing the steam.  I've included a video of what a fast release of the steam looks like.  You don't want your bare hand anywhere close to that hot steam.  Read the instruction manual!!!  Seriously, read it.

            I am an admittedly terrible cook when it comes to traditional means of using a stove and I imagine that my cooking is a slight step up from eating canned dog food, but the Instant Pot has entirely changed this.This thing is friendly for cooking dummies like myself.  There are tons of delicious recipes online that are easy to follow and once everything is in the pot, you simply start a timer and that's it. Once the timer is done, open the valve to release the steam and once the steam has released, dinner is served. There is literally nothing to screw up during the cooking process; it's simple and ingenious.The Instant Pot works by using pressure from steam to significantly shorten cooking times meaning more time for you to do other fun things like hanging out with your significant other, or watching TV, or both!  We've made 'fall off the bone' ribs in about 45 mins (including creating the sauté and taking into account warming up and steam release) that were comparable in taste to ribs that had been slow cooked for 4 hrs. We've also used it to make homemade soups as it takes much less time for the flavour in the ingredients in the soup to trickle into the soup vs traditional boiling over a stove. Chicken in ten minutes? You bet. Perfectly cooked hard boiled eggs in under 5 minutes and delicious cheesecake in under an hour (including steam release) were all no problem for even a simpleton like myself to make, and best of all, everything actually tastes great too!!  I've included pictures of a few of the things we've made using the Instant Pot.  Yes, all of the food pictures in this review were made using the Instant Pot!When it comes to cooking, there aren't too many things out there that are game changers, but an air fryer, a sous vide and an Instant Pot are, and if you happen to have all three, congratulations for having the trifecta of cooking greatness in your kitchen!PROS* So easy to use that even guys that literally can't cook (me) can look like a rock star. Once everything is in the pot, you set the timer and go. Once it's done, open the valve to release the steam and dinner is served. There literally is nothing to screw up and best of all, the food is delicious!* The Instant Pot significantly shortens cooking time of most things, freeing up your valuable time to do other fun things! :P* There are literally tons and tons of delicious recipes online. Guaranteed you will discover there are things that you can make in the Instant Pot that you never knew could be made in an Instant Pot.* Goodbye slow cooker. That was so the 70's.* Easy to clean. The pot is stainless steel and the lid can be removed and fully submerged. The seal on the lid comes off and replacement seals for the lid can be purchased when it eventually wears out.CONS* Too many models just make for mass confusion.  Have a look at my TIPS section for some help.* Expensive, so wait for a sale if you can as they do on sale, especially for big events like Boxing Day, Black Friday, etc.TIPS* Don't get too caught up with the ""x-in-1"" features. They just add a preset cooking time for a type of food to the Instant Pot and up the ""in-1"" number. You can just manually input the cooking time yourself.* The most important thing is determining the size of the Instant Pot that you need. For our family of 4, we went for the 8 quart esp. since the wife likes to make home made soups.* The Lux model does not have low pressure cooking while Duo models have both high and low pressure. Low pressure cooking is typically used to make delicate foods like yogurt, eggs and veggies. If you don't think you'll make yogurt, eggs or veggies in the Instant Pot, just get the Lux model which skips the low pressure. Pro tip: Cooking rice uses high pressure.* Take the Instant Pot outdoors to release the steam when doing a quick release or it will quickly smell up the house of whatever you're making. Use a glove or mitt to be safe.* When making a lot of food, esp. soups, mind the max line. If you want less chance to have a mess on the bottom of the lid, go an inch under the max line.* Be careful when releasing the steam.  I've included a video of what a fast release of the steam looks like.  You don't want your bare hand anywhere close to that hot steam.  Read the instruction manual!!!  Seriously, read it.

The Ultimate Kitchen Multi-Tasker!
Reviewed in Canada on July 26, 2023Size: 6QtStyle: Instant PotVerified Purchase
As an occasional and budding home cook, the 6-quart Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker has been a complete game-changer in my kitchen! This versatile kitchen appliance has become my go-to for whipping up delicious meals with minimal effort and maximum flavor.First and foremost, the 7-in-1 functionality is mind-blowing. It's like having a team of kitchen gadgets in one sleek and compact device. From pressure cooking to slow cooking, rice cooking, steaming, sautéing, yogurt making, and warming, this Instant Pot does it all!The pressure cooking feature is the real star of the show. It significantly reduces cooking times, making it a lifesaver on busy weeknights. Whether I'm preparing tender stews, fall-off-the-bone ribs, or flavor-packed soups, the Instant Pot never fails to deliver perfectly cooked meals in a fraction of the time.The slow cooker function is equally impressive. It lets me set it and forget it, making it incredibly convenient for days when I'm occupied with other tasks. The result? Melt-in-your-mouth pulled pork, rich and hearty chili, or tender pot roasts that are sure to impress.Rice cooking has never been easier. The Instant Pot consistently produces fluffy and perfectly cooked rice, taking away the guesswork and hassle from traditional stovetop methods.I was initially skeptical about the yogurt-making feature, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Homemade yogurt is not only healthier but also more cost-effective, and the Instant Pot handles the process like a pro.The sauté function is perfect for browning meats and sautéing onions and garlic before pressure cooking. It's a fantastic all-in-one tool that reduces the number of pots and pans I need to wash.The 6-quart capacity is ideal for feeding a family or having leftovers for the next day. The stainless steel inner pot is easy to clean, and the exterior stays cool to the touch during cooking, ensuring safety and convenience.The user-friendly control panel with pre-set cooking options and a delay start feature makes meal planning a breeze. Additionally, the included accessories like the steam rack, serving spoon, and measuring cup are thoughtful additions that add to the overall value.In summary, the 6-quart Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker is an absolute must-have for any kitchen. Its versatility, efficiency, and convenience have transformed the way I cook, saving me time and effort without compromising on taste. If you're looking for a kitchen multi-tasker that delivers exceptional results, look no further than the Instant Pot Duo - it's truly a game-changer!

Reviewed in Canada on November 27, 2023Flavour Name: Spiced Rhum & ColaSize: 1 Count (Pack of 12)Verified Purchase
I tried Atypique because, heck, why not. I'm not concerned about my alcohol consumption. As a substitute for the flavour of alcohol, this beverage isn't gonna do it. It tastes nothing like rum and cola (and lets be real, rum and coke). It tastes like slightly cinnamonny, watery, crappy cola, and at the end of the day when you're buying non alcoholic beverages like this (not counting beer), that's exactly what you're getting: just a weirdly flavoured cola at an absurdly premium price. You're quintessentially paying $26 for a vastly inferior coke, and it isn't like these even have more volume than regular cans of cola. $26 is really steep for 12x355ml  cola, it's not as though there's alcohol in it, and the flavour leaves a lot to be desired. It certainly won't fool anyone into thinking they're drinking something with alcohol in it.

Cheapest set if Airpod Pros that I could find and the quality is great. The noise cancellation is the best I’ve ever experienced and they come with 3 sizes to fit good, if you have an iPhone the possibilities expand, it even has a fit test to ensure full range of the devices sound quality and noise cancellation capabilities. There is also a transparent option that allows you to hear straight through he AirPods as if you had nothing in your ear. 100/10

Amazing ear pods! Apple bringing out amazing products as always
Reviewed in Canada on July 16, 2023Verified Purchase
Upgraded from the older AirPods and boy is this an upgrade! these are much smaller yet the bass is exceptional and the sound is crisper then ever before. The battery life is solid (will drain faster on noise cancellation). The noise cancellation is such a great addition and it makes so much of a difference, really blocks noise around you. Comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Sweat proof so these are excellent for the gym or running. Phone calls are loud and clear, the mic is awesome.

Interesting Experience
Reviewed in Canada on February 3, 2022Verified Purchase
I could write a book on my experience with these, I'm an audiophile who spends most of my time immersed in ""music and sound like"" stuff, to put it mildly - I'd also like to add that I am a self-admitted Apple and AppleEcosystem fan, through and through - so these APPs already had the ""edge"" going into the foray of TWS earbud shopping.  So let me begin:- wasn't expecting sonic excellence that of studio grade headphones or monitors, that's a given- was hoping for a better ""soundscape"" than the usual AirPods or earbuds- wasn't hellbent on wireless either, knowing full well that with-wire delivers better audio resolution- was 50/50 on buds versus over-ear style playback systems; wireless or not- I wanted ""a decent listening experience"" wired or notAirPod Pro ""Positives"":- typical Apple feel and design- seamless integration into my iPhone and Mac platforms- intuitive design and interface, typical Apple- the buds once fitted with the right stock tips felt very light in the ear- took very little to settled them into the ear canal for ""best sound delivery and ANC""- overall, pretty comfortable ""except"" for my constant adjustment in trying to ""seal better for bass"" fussing- sonically, they are evenly tempered across most of the frequency range, and surprisingly highly detailed- they have fantastic focus on sibilants and very good instrument/note separation/articulation- charging case is small, slick, seemingly quite sturdy and super convenient- in-case charging was a breeze; as was T-Bolt case charging when needed- cross platform multi-device connectivity is instant and seamless, SO intuitiveAirPod Pro ""Negatives"":- the sound they delivered was at times almost too sibilant, too ""biting"" in the upper registries- they lack a solid bass/low-frequency performance platform- the native adjustments with the preset EQ choices are garbage (parametric please!!)- their inability to play nice with outside streaming platforms other than AppleMusic Lossless is just silly- their ""claim"" to play lossless under the guise of ""hi-def"" AAC is just ridiculous- they refuse to play at the streaming hi-res norm of 24bit/96KHz and AM doesn't even OFFER THIS res- the AAC codec is, IMHO, needing a serious re-working to up the ante to *true* FLAC/ALAC/LDAC ability- only when compared to other competing models (ie WF-1000XM4) did I realize how sterile they sounded- they lack a warmth and fullness, and I'm not asking for artificial DSP here, just ""full bodied audio""- the case is super slippery and something that I found to be a major PITA when trying pry the buds out from- foam ear tips should be included in the package as an end-user option, not just silicone- they did *not* sound like a $275-$300 pair of APPLE audio earbuds (IMHO) ought to sound- Spatial is cute, but it's matched with 360- Soundstage is acceptable given certain genres, but very limited given those ""certain genres""I feel it's way better to await the anticipated AirPod Pro II's - and HOPEFULLY Apple will have listened to their clientele and given these new buds a better codec, better BT codec, and the ability to stream and accept 24bit/96KHz actual ""Lossless"" high-resolution audio; and also get a better native app to allow the end user to customize their audio to best fit their needs - not just ""deductive EQ"" audio presets.  The APPs feel old and sound like they're missing something given the rest of todays audio tech.  I hope Apple addresses these shortcomings in their next AirPod Pro iteration.  I'll happily buy back into them to keep my AppleEcosystem intact 100%3.5 Stars at bestFootnote:  I made the decision to opt solely into TWS as even WITH wire, and as it is I intend to use my iPhone for mobile music and convenience; I'd still have to purchase an outboard DAC in order to benefit from the maximum audio rendering that the iPhone and AM apparently dish out.  Even the AirPodMax don't render ""true"" lossless high-bit/frequency...AND THAT'S WHILE PLUGGED IN!!  Apple - c'mon, if there's a company out there that can do this right - it's you.  Don't let us down.  Get the AirPod Pro 2's RIGHT when you launch to the public!!

New Apple AirPods Pro
Reviewed in Canada on February 9, 2022Verified Purchase
Highly recommended.  These are so good, that I gave 2 sets to my mom, so that she can listen all day uninterrupted with no recharging down time.  She has had several ear buds, but none have fit her like these Airpod Pros.  The comfort, and fit, the sound and nc are super good.  Compared to much more expensive models like Bose, or Sony, these are a great alternative.  The caveat is, these are not for everyone.  You must have a certain shape of ear (which I personally do not), in order to keep these earbuds from falling out when you get active.  I personally gave my Pros up to my daughter and got the Bose NC Earbuds, which fit my ear shape better.

Waste of my time and money. Thanks for nothing Amazon
Reviewed in Canada on July 25, 2022Verified Purchase
Bought these less than a week ago. I bought them used so it cost me a tiny bit less, but they were advertised as “Perfect Condition, Slight Box Damage”. I used them for a couple days and realized that the left airpod would consistently die at 70% every single time without fail. I then talked to 2 customer service reps who both told me the only thing I could do was return them for a refund, and spend more money on new ones. I understand that they were used, but if you advertise something in perfect condition, and it isn’t upon arrival, maybe don’t tell your loyal customer that there’s absolutely nothing they can do but waste time and more money on new ones. Not pleased with the customer service, nor am I pleased with the product. Beyond the battery issue I loved the AirPods for the 30% battery I could get out of them. Wish they would’ve worked properly as advertised.

Reviewed in Canada on July 31, 2022Verified Purchase
Been daily driving my pair since Febuary and the best thing about the Apple Airpods Pros is definitely the Noise Cancellation. Nothing I own matches how much it isolates the outside world nor the transparency mode which makes me feel like I'm not wearing airpods at all if I set the music low enough. the Sound quality is good enough but not the best there is so if you're going for that you can find better. Its easy to connect to my Phone and it can work with other things via bluetooth (though its a bit of a pain to sometimes switch between the iPhone and non-apple stuff). Overall, pretty satisfied about getting them but I also could've waited for a sale.

Reviewed in Canada on August 28, 2023Verified Purchase
WHOA!Trust me, spray this outside first to really get a 'sense' of how potent this stuff is. Due to it taking a few primer pumps and then the first 'spray' being small, I sprayed again, towards the downwind. Then I immediately moved towards where I sprayed... me and my coworker were shocked at the stench! It's rancid for sure and plus, I got a tiny bit on the back of my hand from the spray, so PLEASE NOTE, when first testing, make sure to wear gloves unless you want your hand to smell like it for a bit! Even a faint scent of this smell can make the strongest stomach weak!I plan to get an empty bottle of the same size, pour half in that and then dilute both with water to hopefully soften the intensity of it so that the prank could be used indoors.Again, when using outside (preferable too in it's natural state), make sure you are upwind and spray downwind (with a glove incase little droplets get on your hand).

Best Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Headphones on the Market - Replacing my AirPods Max
Reviewed in Canada on May 30, 2022Colour Name: SilverVerified Purchase
Ready for the best in class noise cancelling headphones with incredible sound profiles completely customizable? I owned them all. AirPods Max, Sony XM3, XM4, Bose 700. The all new Sony XM5’s is the new king of NC headphones.✔ Much Better Microphone (vs. XM4) – Tested with Zoom/Microsoft Teams business calls and family/personal calls. Performs much better than XM4 previous generation✔ Long Term Comfort – I can wear them for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort while wearing my glasses. XM4’s felt warm/hot after long term use, XM5’s have more breathability.✔ Touch Controls – Works flawlessly between swipes and tap. Feels like an upgrade with better sensitivity compared to previous generation.✔Bluetooth & Connectivity – I take them off, music pauses, I put them back on, music resumes. I walk anywhere in my home while leaving my phone on my desk. Clear sound, no distortion whatsoever, signal transmission remains in-tact and stable at any given moment. I have them connected to my iPhone and MacBook Pro, I’m able to swap between both devices quickly.✔Hard Case & Wire – The case is good quality, headphones fit perfectly with slot for USB C charging cable and audio aux cable, both included no extra charge.✔Sony app is full of features. Can customize audio profiles or use presets. The presets are excellent for any genres of music and I often swap depending on my mood. Updates are done through the app. NC and transparency mode can be controlled in the app or by using a button on the headphones. Adaptive sound is nice, it auto detects my environment and changes from NC and transparency. It works in my favor, no complaints. Auto power off is an option, or manually turn them off using the button on the headphones.I purchased 2 pairs of the new Sony XM5’s – one for my wife and one for myself. We absolutely love using the latest and greater wireless noise cancelling headphones – I can easily say that both Sony and Apple make the best out there. Because I own all the latest NC headphones, I created a comparison below between the 2 best: Sony XM5’ and how they compare with Apple’s Air Pods Max.Sound Quality: Winner TiedI tested the XM5’s using Tidal and Apple Music using both wired and wireless. I found the music quality on the XM5’s sound better on specific genres such as Jazz, Bossa Nova, Hip-Hop (90’s), Classical Rock, Symphony, and R&B.The APM are ahead when it comes to EDM like House, Drum & Bass, along with Pop and other computerized music.Both headphones are close for most genres, however the biggest difference I noticed between the two was Jazz like genres, with the XM5’s being leagues ahead.This is a tie because it depends on the genre you prefer.Audio Enhancements: Winner Air Pods MaxThe XM5’s offer 360 Audio Reality which is only accessible to less popular streaming music apps like Tidal, while the APM offer Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio. The audio library for the sound enhancement is also smaller for Sony with limited selections.Comfort: Winner Sony XM5The XM5 can remain on your head for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort given its lightweight feel. When walking around the house, or outdoors, the XM5’s remains on your head without moving.The APM on the other hand are heavier and begin causing some discomfort after 1-2 hours. When stationary, they’re fine, but when walking around and tilting your head, they begin to slip off.Features: Winner Sony XM5Sony offers an headphones app accessible from the App Store or Google Play Store which allows you to heavily customize your XM5’s, from building a sound profile, selecting audio pre-sets, adjusting noise cancelling, transparency modes and a great deal more.The APM on the other hand, do not have an app of any kind, besides the ability to select audio pre-sets from the music app you subscribe to.Transparency Mode: Winner Air Pods MaxThe transparency mode on the APM is unlike anything else; I can have full conversations that sound natural. The XM5’s on the other hand are an upgrade from the XM4’s, but it doesn’t sound as natural as the APM.Microphone: Winner Air Pods MaxThe microphone on the APM is excellent; I’ve hosted hundreds of hours of business meetings and personal phone calls; the microphone is crystal clear and professional.The XM5’s on the other hand is an upgrade from the XM4’s and noticeable a lot better, but the APM are noticeably better. I tested the XM5’s for calls and was satisfied with the results.Noise Cancelling: Winner Sony XM5When wearing the APM for a long period of time, my ears feel like they’re going to explode. When I first purchased the APM on the release date, I could use the noise cancelling option for hours however, after over a year, I can no longer handle noise cancellation beyond 15 minutes it gives me severe ear pain and I must switch to transparency mode or take them off and break.The XM5’s on the other hand, do not cause me any pain, regardless of if I’m listening for 30 minutes or 2 hours. During testing, I listened to music for a long period of time and watched a YouTube for an hour.I feel that prolonged listening to the APM using the noise cancelling feature caused my ears to become highly sensitive after using them for over a year, with a feeling of severe cabin pressure. This is also worse if using the Bose QC35’s, with pressure being too intense.I can wear the XM5’s for long periods of time; they manage to block loud televisions and screaming babies. The biggest takeaway is being able to keep them on for several hours without discomfort or pain.Build Quality: Winner Air Pods MaxThe APM are built to look and feel luxurious. From the band, metal, and aluminum components, they feel like the Lamborghini of headphones. The XM5’s on the other hand are made out of sophisticated plastic. Also, the APM has magnetic interchangeable ear cushions that can be purchased separately, while the XM5’s do not.Accessories & Costs: Winner Sony XM5Sony offers a real carrying case that protects the headphones and its accessories from damage/drops. Apple has a bra-like case that doesn’t protect the headphones at all, forcing the user to purchase a third-party case online. Also, Sony offers a headphone cable, while Apple requires a separate purchase ($45). This means between the cable and the case; you’re looking at almost $100 of added expenses with the APM.Moreover, the price at the time of this review is $499 for the XM5’s and $779.00 for the APM.

                Best Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Headphones on the Market - Replacing my AirPods Max

            Ready for the best in class noise cancelling headphones with incredible sound profiles completely customizable? I owned them all. AirPods Max, Sony XM3, XM4, Bose 700. The all new Sony XM5’s is the new king of NC headphones.✔ Much Better Microphone (vs. XM4) – Tested with Zoom/Microsoft Teams business calls and family/personal calls. Performs much better than XM4 previous generation✔ Long Term Comfort – I can wear them for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort while wearing my glasses. XM4’s felt warm/hot after long term use, XM5’s have more breathability.✔ Touch Controls – Works flawlessly between swipes and tap. Feels like an upgrade with better sensitivity compared to previous generation.✔Bluetooth & Connectivity – I take them off, music pauses, I put them back on, music resumes. I walk anywhere in my home while leaving my phone on my desk. Clear sound, no distortion whatsoever, signal transmission remains in-tact and stable at any given moment. I have them connected to my iPhone and MacBook Pro, I’m able to swap between both devices quickly.✔Hard Case & Wire – The case is good quality, headphones fit perfectly with slot for USB C charging cable and audio aux cable, both included no extra charge.✔Sony app is full of features. Can customize audio profiles or use presets. The presets are excellent for any genres of music and I often swap depending on my mood. Updates are done through the app. NC and transparency mode can be controlled in the app or by using a button on the headphones. Adaptive sound is nice, it auto detects my environment and changes from NC and transparency. It works in my favor, no complaints. Auto power off is an option, or manually turn them off using the button on the headphones.I purchased 2 pairs of the new Sony XM5’s – one for my wife and one for myself. We absolutely love using the latest and greater wireless noise cancelling headphones – I can easily say that both Sony and Apple make the best out there. Because I own all the latest NC headphones, I created a comparison below between the 2 best: Sony XM5’ and how they compare with Apple’s Air Pods Max.Sound Quality: Winner TiedI tested the XM5’s using Tidal and Apple Music using both wired and wireless. I found the music quality on the XM5’s sound better on specific genres such as Jazz, Bossa Nova, Hip-Hop (90’s), Classical Rock, Symphony, and R&B.The APM are ahead when it comes to EDM like House, Drum & Bass, along with Pop and other computerized music.Both headphones are close for most genres, however the biggest difference I noticed between the two was Jazz like genres, with the XM5’s being leagues ahead.This is a tie because it depends on the genre you prefer.Audio Enhancements: Winner Air Pods MaxThe XM5’s offer 360 Audio Reality which is only accessible to less popular streaming music apps like Tidal, while the APM offer Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio. The audio library for the sound enhancement is also smaller for Sony with limited selections.Comfort: Winner Sony XM5The XM5 can remain on your head for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort given its lightweight feel. When walking around the house, or outdoors, the XM5’s remains on your head without moving.The APM on the other hand are heavier and begin causing some discomfort after 1-2 hours. When stationary, they’re fine, but when walking around and tilting your head, they begin to slip off.Features: Winner Sony XM5Sony offers an headphones app accessible from the App Store or Google Play Store which allows you to heavily customize your XM5’s, from building a sound profile, selecting audio pre-sets, adjusting noise cancelling, transparency modes and a great deal more.The APM on the other hand, do not have an app of any kind, besides the ability to select audio pre-sets from the music app you subscribe to.Transparency Mode: Winner Air Pods MaxThe transparency mode on the APM is unlike anything else; I can have full conversations that sound natural. The XM5’s on the other hand are an upgrade from the XM4’s, but it doesn’t sound as natural as the APM.Microphone: Winner Air Pods MaxThe microphone on the APM is excellent; I’ve hosted hundreds of hours of business meetings and personal phone calls; the microphone is crystal clear and professional.The XM5’s on the other hand is an upgrade from the XM4’s and noticeable a lot better, but the APM are noticeably better. I tested the XM5’s for calls and was satisfied with the results.Noise Cancelling: Winner Sony XM5When wearing the APM for a long period of time, my ears feel like they’re going to explode. When I first purchased the APM on the release date, I could use the noise cancelling option for hours however, after over a year, I can no longer handle noise cancellation beyond 15 minutes it gives me severe ear pain and I must switch to transparency mode or take them off and break.The XM5’s on the other hand, do not cause me any pain, regardless of if I’m listening for 30 minutes or 2 hours. During testing, I listened to music for a long period of time and watched a YouTube for an hour.I feel that prolonged listening to the APM using the noise cancelling feature caused my ears to become highly sensitive after using them for over a year, with a feeling of severe cabin pressure. This is also worse if using the Bose QC35’s, with pressure being too intense.I can wear the XM5’s for long periods of time; they manage to block loud televisions and screaming babies. The biggest takeaway is being able to keep them on for several hours without discomfort or pain.Build Quality: Winner Air Pods MaxThe APM are built to look and feel luxurious. From the band, metal, and aluminum components, they feel like the Lamborghini of headphones. The XM5’s on the other hand are made out of sophisticated plastic. Also, the APM has magnetic interchangeable ear cushions that can be purchased separately, while the XM5’s do not.Accessories & Costs: Winner Sony XM5Sony offers a real carrying case that protects the headphones and its accessories from damage/drops. Apple has a bra-like case that doesn’t protect the headphones at all, forcing the user to purchase a third-party case online. Also, Sony offers a headphone cable, while Apple requires a separate purchase ($45). This means between the cable and the case; you’re looking at almost $100 of added expenses with the APM.Moreover, the price at the time of this review is $499 for the XM5’s and $779.00 for the APM. The Sony’s offer a much better value.Conclusion:There are many factors to take into consideration between both brands, but ultimately, my heart is with the XM5’s because they sound better for the genres I listen to (Jazz) on a daily basis, and it puts me in the musical ‘zone’. Also, the noise cancelling feature from the XM5’s don’t give me the ‘cabin pressure’ feeling found from the APM.

The holy grail of headphones in my opinion!
Reviewed in Canada on October 15, 2023Colour Name: SilverVerified Purchase
I'm not a super techy person so apologies if this review lacks a lot of techy details. I'm a student who lives with a music producer, and while I value my peace and quiet, I don't always get it at home for obvious reasons.The noise cancelling feature of this headphones is next level! When I put them on and start playing music, I feel completely isolated! I like the touch control features on the headphones as well. Saves me from having to reach for my phone every time i want to increasee/decrease the volume and stop or skip music. I also like that I can change from noice cancellation mode to transparent mode by just holding my hand on the right ear phone. It's nice that i don't have to remove the headphones and put it back on every time I want to have a brief conversation with someone.The headphones themselves are very light weight, and they come in a very nice looking protective case that actually protects the headphones. It also comes with the charging cord but you have to use your own USB wall plug.I use the apple ecosystem but I found that these headphones work well with Apple products. I don't need any of the fancy superdetailed sound features that apparently only work with Android for what I do so I'm happy with the purchase so far. I did have a bit of a problem connecting them to my Macbook but found out that I just had to hold the pairing button for about 10 seconds or so and the issue was resolved. It was very easy to connect to my iPhone and I had no issues there. I just had to install the app first before connecting them.The app offers good features for customizing the equalizer and what not. I like that I can set the noise cancellation at different levels for different places for instance when I'm on transit, or when I'm walking on the street.Word of caution if you use this headphones while walking, look around you to make sure you see cars, bicycles coming because I feel it'd be too easy to get into an accident! These headphones are also not waterproof so they're not ideal for walking outside in the rain without an umbrella, or wearing them at the gym if you know you're gonna be sweating a lot.I did notice that like other reviewers mentioned, after wearing the headphones for about 2 hours or so my head started hurting because of the weight distribution of the headphones. It's not ideal but for everything else that these headphones offer, it's something I'm willing to live with.

It's a portable oasis of magical silence
Reviewed in Canada on December 11, 2023Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
TL/DR: this headphone is noise cancelation magic in a compact, light and comfortable all-day use format.- Active Noise cancelation: 10/10 - best in class. period. It's like magic.- Passive noise isolation: 8/10 - surprisingly decent.- Sound Quality: 8/10 only and, ONLY if you are using a LDAC capable source. (windows does not support it at the time of writing). The app is good for tuning your sound profile to your preferences. Non LDAC connections use the standard Bluetooth pairing and it will sound meh, but that's the codec's fault, not the headphone's.- Battery life: 10/10. Actually lasts 24hours. In real life use that's roughly 3 days- Connectivity: 9/10. strong signals and you can connect 2 devices at the same time. It's all day phone and work laptop with no hassle and intelligent automatic switching between sources. works with a dead battery via cable - you always have a backup.- Call quality: 10/10. The other side is always clear and friends said my voice was crystal clear even in noisy environments (as the headphone filters noise out too)- Functions: 9/10. Easy to use buttons, the environment and chat functions are awesome. The touch sensitive panel is nice, but can get an input wrong here and there.- Price: 8/10. Better and cheaper than Bose. Buy on promo though.

Reviewed in Canada on December 18, 2020Verified Purchase
I got these pills after reading reviews and figured it would be something fun to do with my family, seeing as we were all stuck inside due to COVID.THE TASET:I have an inversion to chalky textured items (think time), and while the actual flavor of the pill was pleasant, the texture of the pellet itself was a little bit funky for me, but the rest of my family had no issue whatsoever.DOES IT WORK?It 100% works!!! I went into it with high expectations and they were completely blown out of the water. Strawberries became the sweetest strawberries I'd ever eaten, lemons became lemonade, pickles became something I can't even describe... It was AMAZING. There are four of us that tried it and it worked for each and every one of us with just one pill each.This is something I'll definitely be recommending to friends and family to try.If you found this review helpful, let me know by clicking the helpful button down below.

Reviewed in Canada on December 30, 2023Size: SPC023Colour Name: PurpleVerified Purchase
I have really severe cramps, I'm usually curled up in a ball for at least a day or two. While this product doesn't completely alleviate the pain and discomfort, it definitely minimizes it for me.The 3rd heat setting is quite hot, and when my pain is most severe, I find it's comfortable. But I did have to go down to the second setting as it was too hot after a while. The second setting is what I find myself using the most. The low setting is warm, and nice when the cramps start to subside.The vibrating settings are great, help distract/ease the pain. Though the vibrations are a little loud. I put the heating pad on and put it under a pair of jeans while I ran some errands. Super comfortable, didn't move around but the vibrating settings are a little loud for public.As a plus size person, I was worried it would move around and not sit right. I put the band a little higher on my hips, and then tucked the control panel (heating pad) under my little pooch. And it was secure.I'm so glad I bought this product. The only downside is it takes forever to charge. I'm almost tempted to get another one so I can have one on while the other charges.

An Absolute Game Changer for Comfort and Relief!
Reviewed in Canada on July 19, 2023Size: LargeColour Name: BeigeVerified Purchase
As someone who often experiences the discomfort of menstrual cramps, I must say that the Slimpal Electric Heating Pad is a lifesaver. Its smart design and user-friendly features have truly revolutionized my approach to pain management, and I cannot recommend this product enough.One of the standout features of this heating pad is its wearable design. The fact that it's portable and hands-free has given me the flexibility to move around and continue my day-to-day activities without any hindrance. The extra belt provided ensures a secure fit around the belly or back, accommodating various body types beautifully. This thoughtful inclusion by Slimpal really does add an extra level of comfort and convenience.The size of the pad is another plus point. As a 'plus-sized' heating pad, it provides ample coverage to soothe not just the cramp-prone area but also the surrounding regions. The warmth distribution is even, with no cold or excessively hot spots, which is indicative of the quality of this product.Its functionality does not disappoint either. The Slimpal Electric Heating Pad heats up quickly, which is a godsend when cramps strike suddenly. The heat settings are adjustable, allowing me to tailor the intensity of the warmth according to my comfort level. The auto shut-off feature is a cherry on top, providing safety and peace of mind while using the pad overnight or when I drift off to sleep.Lastly, I appreciate the fact that it is easy to clean and comes with a stylish, discreet carrying bag, making it perfect for on-the-go use. It would make an excellent gift for anyone who battles with menstrual cramps regularly - it certainly has made my life so much easier.To all the girls, women, and wives out there, give the Slimpal Electric Heating Pad a try. This product is worth every penny for the comfort, relief, and independence it offers during that challenging time of the month. Five stars without a doubt!

This heating massager is very comfortable and helps my cramps, but the battery and the heating part of it sucks. Within 1-2 hours, the battery is drained. It also takes forever to fully charge. I also don’t know if it is because I put the massager on top of my shirt instead of my actual skin, but it’s not as hot as I want it even with the highest setting. But it’s still comfortably warm! Everything else is great. Just mostly the battery is the problem.

Reviewed in Canada on October 26, 2023Size: SPC020Colour Name: PinkVerified Purchase
Very helpful during my most recent period, the heat it can produce is very impressive. I wish it held a charge longer as I need heat for hours on end during cramps, and the three hour turnaround until its recharged leaves some to be desired. Not slim enough to be worn under most clothes, but worked well under a work apron. The massage feature is far too loud to use in public, and it would be nice if the surface area was a bit larger as I find myself moving it around a lot to redistribute the heat. Very impressive with the size of the band! As a plus sized person I was worried it wouldn’t comfortably sit but it was stretchy enough to be positioned anywhere without issue

The Best Compact Echo Video Speaker now with Remote Viewing
Reviewed in Canada on June 16, 2021Colour Name: CharcoalConfiguration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
This review is broken down into two parts.  Part 1 is Short with some detail, while Part Two is more in-depth with more detail.*** Part 1 ***I’ve owned the original Gen 1 Echo Show 5 Smart Speaker since May 2019 and it remains my favorite Echo Smart Speaker.  The Echo Show 5 is the perfect speaker for the Bedroom, Kitchen and Office.  The 1.65”, 4 watt speaker sounds better than the Echo Dot while the 5.5” touch screen adds much more versatility than regular Echo Smart Speakers.Gen 1 or Gen 2 What’s the Difference?The Gen 1 and Gen 2 Echo Show 5 Video Speakers are virtually identical with the exception of three features.1 - Upgraded CameraThe new Gen 2 Echo Show has a 2MP front facing camera instead of a 1MP camera on the Gen 1.  The camera is better however if you want to use the Echo Show for Video Calls the New Echo Show 8, Gen 2 has a 13MP camera with auto framing.  If the primary use for this speaker is video calls then the Echo Show 8 Gen 2 is the way to go.2 - Remote Viewing - Security CameraThe second upgrade Amazon Added to the Echo Show 5 Gen 2 is the ability to use the built in camera for home monitoring.  The camera on the Show 5 Gen 2 can be used to monitor your home while you’re not at home.  This feature is not available on Gen 1 Show Speakers.3 - SidewalkThe third feature Amazon added to Gen 2 Echo speakers is something called Amazon Sidewalk.  Sidewalk is a low-powered mesh network that is designed to make smart devices work better when you are outside your home.  While Sidewalk is a useful idea, I have disabled it due to privacy and security concerns.  I Do Not recommend you use this feature.There are some other minor changes to the new Echo Show 5 Gen 2 but in a nutshell the above three features are the main differences between Gen 1 and Gen 2 Echo Show 5 Speakers.The new Echo Show 5 Gen 2, looks the same, sounds the same and with the exception of the Remote Viewing Security Camera option, works the same.If the security camera option is not really important to you then the Echo Show 5 Gen 1 is still and excellent speaker and you can buy it at a substantial discount till stock runs out.*** Which Echo Speaker Should I Get Show 5 or Show 8? ***The Echo Show 5 is the Best Smart Speaker to use as an Alarm Clock in the bedroom or compact Display speaker for the Kitchen or Office.If you want a larger screen, have more room on the kitchen counter or office desk then the Show 8 would be a better choice.If your primary purpose is going to be Video Calls or Streaming Video then the Echo Show 8 is a better choice.*** PART 2 ***The new Second Gen Echo Show 5 looks exactly the same as the previous first generation Echo show and is physically almost identical with a couple slight variations.*** Looks ***The layout of the controls on the top of the echo show is the same only the Camera privacy indicator is Square on the New Second Gen Echo Show 5 and was round on the first gen Show 5.They removed the 3.5mm audio output jack on the Gen 2 Echo Show and added a micro USB port for service on the back.  This means you can still output the sound from the Echo Show 5 to a Bluetooth speaker if you wish but the hardwired connection is gone.  The micro USB port is used only for service.The color of the Black Fabric on the back side of the new Gen 2 Echo show is a little darker or more saturated than the previous Gen 1.  I would describe the Gen 3 Echo Show as black and the Gen 1 Echo show as charcoal.••• Video Screen •••There is no change to the screen resolution between the Echo Show 5 Gen 1 and Gen2.While the screen resolution is only 960x480 the screen seems bigger, brighter and clearer than you’d think*** Sound ***The sound on the Echo Show 5 is decent for its size and fills up a room nicely if you keep the volume under 75%.  Once you turn up the volume past the 3/4 mark the treble gets to be too prominent and the speaker gets out of balance.If you want the Best Sounding Echo Speaker with a video screen I would recommend the Echo Show 8.••• White Power Cord/Power Supply ??? •••In 2021 Amazon only includes a white power supply with all their Echo devices regarding of color.  This means BLACK, WHITE or Colored Echo devices all come with the same WHITE Colored power supply …. YUK!  This is one change I wish Amazon didn’t make.  I would prefer a Black coloured power supply and cable with Black devices and White power cord on white devices. The white power cord/transformer is not a deal breaker but If Amazon was going decide on one color for the power supply and cord I wish they would have selected BLACK rather than white.  White discolours, gets dirty and yellows over time with UV exposure.••• Performance •••Inside the new Gen 2 Echo show uses the same MediaTek MT8163 processor as the Gen 1.  The only hardware upgrade is the front facing camera.*** Camera ***The camera on the Gen 2 Show 5 has been upgraded from 1MP to 2MP.  For Privacy Amazon built in a sliding camera lens cover which is easy to use and colour coded so you will know when the camera lens is open or closed.  We keep the camera lens closed all the time unless we're making a video call.  The Show 5 Supports Echo to Echo calling and Skype.IMPORTANT CAMERA TIP:  The New Echo Show 8 Gen 2 has a 13MP camera with point, tilt and zoom.  If you are planning to use the Echo show 5 primarily for video calling then the Echo Show 8 is a Much Better Choice.*** Security Camera - Remote Viewing ***The biggest reason to upgrade to the new Echo Show 5 Gen 2 is the ability to use the device as a security camera.  While the camera doesn’t record, it does allow you to look in and monitor your home to help you verify if an alarm in your home is false or real.The security camera feature can not be activated if the Echo Show 5 is in Do Not Disturb mode or if the camera cover is closed.When the security camera feature is activated a message appears on the Screen of the Echo Show announcing that “A household member is viewing your camera”.  There is a STOP Button on the screen which you can press to stop the security camera feed.*** Important Camera Note ***The camera on the Echo Show 5 is a fixed camera and unless you add a tilt stand stand or prop up the back the camera on the Echo Show 5 will point at the ceiling.*** Other FEATURES ***The Gen 2 Echo Show five supports all the same features as the previous Gen 1 Show 5 so you can use Alexa voice search and commands to control smart home devices, ask questions, weather, sports scores etc.  You can stream music from Amazon, Apple, Audible, SiriusXM and Spotify.  You can play video from Amazon Prime and Netflix but not Hulu.For video calls the Gen 2 Echo 5 supports Amazon Drop from other Echo displays plus the Alexa app and Skype.*** The Bottom Line - Conclusion ***Amazon continues to improve and add functionality to all their Echo Show Video Smart Speakers.  I heartily recommend both new Echo Show 5 and 8 Gen 2 Speakers.The New Echo Show 5 Gen 2 is the most affordable Video Smart Speaker and best suited as an alarm clock in the bedroom, kitchen or office.The Echo Show 8 Gen 2 is Amazon’s Best Overall Smart Video Speaker and perfect for areas where you have more counter space.  The camera in the Echo Show 8 Gen is much better and the screen is larger making it the perfect speaker for streaming video and video conference calls.

Technical problems resolved
Reviewed in Canada on April 24, 2023Colour Name: CharcoalConfiguration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
I purchased an echo show 5 and a Blink video door bell to add to my existing Blink mini and sync module 2. The door bell was successfully connected to the sync module and Alexa app. I am able to view the Blink mini with the Echo show but not the doorbell camera.The door bell is recognized on the Blink app and Alexa app. However when Alexa is requested to ""show door bell"" it fails with a message: ""door bell is not responding"".  I have tried for hours trouble shooting with the on line self help services to no avail.  Blink customer service was not helpful. Really frustrating!UPDATE:Following the above review I was promptly contacted by Amazon and Blink. Within 48 hrs. Blink had detected the problem. After a software update it was resolved and I am now most satisficed with the items.Great customer service and I thank you.

He has a jolly jumper at his house that he lost interest in a few months ago so we are surprised he still has a good go with this one.  He’s a wild guy in it but it seems good quality so should hold up for future grand kids... good buy :)

Baby loves it!
Reviewed in Canada on April 25, 2023Pattern Name: Rainforest JumperooVerified Purchase
This jumper is great! It has a lot of little things on it to keep baby occupied and entertained. We don’t like to keep our baby in it for too long or even very often as we’re afraid it will be bad for his hip development. So we only do about 5-10 minutes every couple days or so. But he is 4 months old and fits in it well, and he enjoys it! I like that the music option has a continuous mode so that it keeps playing even if baby isn’t touching anything.

            This jumper is great! It has a lot of little things on it to keep baby occupied and entertained. We don’t like to keep our baby in it for too long or even very often as we’re afraid it will be bad for his hip development. So we only do about 5-10 minutes every couple days or so. But he is 4 months old and fits in it well, and he enjoys it! I like that the music option has a continuous mode so that it keeps playing even if baby isn’t touching anything.

pretty good but there are flaws
Reviewed in Canada on June 17, 2020Pattern Name: Rainforest JumperooVerified Purchase
As a thing that allows your baby to bounce in, this sure does that. It is built well enough that despite my baby's exceptional exuberance and excess energy, I feel safe with this product.As a thing that will engage your baby for a long time, umm, I think it can definitely be improved there. There are really not a lot of variety of toys that grab your baby's attention. There is a sun spinner mounted high, and there is another low spinner, but they are both spinners (transparent containers with something inside that the baby can spin). The toys hanging on the musical control centre are just hard plastic things that don't do anything or make any noise. So my baby gets bored of them pretty fast. The dragonfly (teething toy?) doesn't self retract, so once pulled out, it just dangles to the side. The wheel of fortune spinner is bent on mine and does not spin at all. And I think the rotation to a different station is only possible with a parent's help (or when the baby is much older). But I then imagine a baby much older will not want to be in a bouncer.The height adjustment is also quite coarse, between setting 1 and 2 is like maybe 1.5"" or 2"". So if your baby is too tall for 1, he/she will be too short for 2.It takes a little time to master getting your baby into this thing by yourself. You have to hold your baby mostly with one arm, and then use your other arm to guide their two feet into the cloth bucket holes. If you just drop your baby in hoping for the best you will likely end up with your baby having one leg through a leg hole, and the other one bunched up by the crotch part.Anyway, overall, it is a solidly built bouncer that allows your baby to bounce. But it is not a great entertainment centre.

Love this thing
Reviewed in Canada on April 21, 2023Pattern Name: Rainforest JumperooVerified Purchase
My son loves this thing, he's on the small side but can use it on the lowest setting. I love that you can raise it as they grow so it lasts longer. For the reviewer who said this hurt her child's legs - why aren't you raising it according to the baby's height? It shouldn't hurt your baby if it's properly adjusted for their size.The music is cute and the batteries last quite a while, when setup correctly it's very sturdy. No complaints here, just one happy baby in our house.

Awesome Remake
Reviewed in Canada on February 10, 2014Verified Purchase
Im so glad Nintendo remade this game for for the Wii u. It takes all the great moments and features from the original and make them even better!Pros:- HD resolution and smooth framerate (mostly)- Shortened repetative actions (using any wind waker song more than once becomes instant)- Controls feel more natural (Better mapping)- Faster sailing- Revamped soundtrack sounds better than ever!- Hero mode adds difficulty and replayability- Easier locations for certain items, mainly triforce pieces- Cheaper than most games (I consider this a big plus since I buy many games)Cons:- Frame rate sometimes dips when there is alot happening on screen.Overall this is a great game whether you have never played it before or have played the original many times like myself! Its definitely shelf worthy for any Wii U owner because anyone can play it and have fun. If you buy this game also consider the guide founf here: http://www.amazon.ca/Legend-Zelda-Waker-Prima-Official/dp/0804161356/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1392061716&sr=8-1-fkmr1

Worth It!
Reviewed in Canada on September 15, 2016Verified Purchase
LOVE IT! I have the original for GameCube, and was a little nervous about buying this one...I kept wondering ""what did they change?"" ""is it going to be the same?"" ""is it better?""IT'S GREAT! My favourite thing is that they took the items board and put it (and the map) on the controller screen, it makes it much easier to change Items. The only flaw, is the aiming, you either have to use the camera stick (located about the buttons you need to use, so annoying) or move your controller to aim before you shoot (arrows, boomerang, bombs, etc.) and it doesn't always respond well. That's literally the ONLY problem.If you have never played this game before DO IT! it's so much fun.

I played the original Wind Waker back when it first came out and had very fond memories, so getting the HD version was a no brainer. I am amazed at how good this version looks and I was also pleased with the tweaks that were added to alleviate some of the more time-consuming aspects of the original. Wind Waker also greatly benefited from the Wii U controller, with the ability to use the map on the little screen while sailing on the TV.

Reviewed in Canada on May 23, 2023Verified Purchase
First let me say, I started playing games during the pandemic. My kids say I'm progressing well for an old fart,Delivery was prompt. I'm upgrading from a PS4 and so far I'm not sure. The PS5 works great it's very quiet. It plays all my purchased PS4 games and lets me use my PS4 controllers to play the PS4 games.What is causing me concern is some menu items are in unfamiliar places. I'm sure I'll adapt.The other nitpicky thing is the included PS5 controller. It works fine and feels good in the hands, slightly heavier than PS4 controllers. but the charge dissipates at an accelerated rate because of the vibro-shock stuff.Conclusion: It's still early days but I think the PS5 and I will become close companions.

Kinda cool, But needs LOTS of work!
Reviewed in Canada on March 14, 2021Colour Name: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Show 10Verified Purchase
A cool piece of tech. It certainly has some flaws though. I’m hoping some of these issues are temporary, and that they will be fixed in an update very soon.The sound is good. I wouldn’t say great. Mids and highs are clear and crisp. Bass (meh) is kinda there IF you have the bass setting turned all the way up to full, but overall it’s fairly weak. For a screen just sitting on a fairly large speaker, and with today’s newest audio tech available, I sure expected MUCH more with this. I set my background to my Amazon App uploaded pictures, just like I have done on my multiple other smaller Echo Show 5’s with no problems. With this new Echo Show 10 3rd Gen, its been a total headache! It cycles through my pictures for a little while, then it repeats a bunch of the same pics again for some reason, then sometimes the screen just goes completely dark. No clock, no pictures. Nothing. Just dark. I have made sure that the screen timeout Auto Sleep feature is turned OFF, so that isn’t it. Other issues are, it just gets stuck sometimes on one picture as my background, usually at the end of my uploaded pictures that it is trying to show, and it gets stuck showing it over and over again, or it gets stuck on another card/page like the weather etc, and won’t continue to cycle through my personal pictures once it’s made it’s way through them all. It doesn’t keep going on a loop in the background like it should. It should allow us to set it to shuffle or randomize the pictures being displayed in the background from our uploads on the app. Like I said, this is all working just fine on all my other smaller Echo Show 5 devices using and displaying my uploaded Amazon pictures as a background through the app, so It’s an obvious glitch with this new one. I’ve re-started the device several times, and did as much as I can on my end fooling around with it in all the different settings etc, but all these annoying weird things still keep happening. This issue alone makes me want to return it, if it can’t even handle being a simple digital frame without glitching out! Overall, It honestly does a terrible job as a digital frame/clock as It never shuffles the pictures properly while displaying them as a background. When it does work for a while, It just displays the pictures in what appears to be a straight series sequence, apparently that they were dated and taken in/uploaded.The new Echo Show 10 3rd Gen also doesn’t seem to work great with Apple Music. Yes it will play music if you ask it too, using your Apple Music account, but that’s about it, they don’t play well together. It won’t recognize your Apple Music playlist’s that you have likely painfully taken the time to create. Sometimes, randomly it WILL recognize my Apple Music playlist, BUT it then only says it’s found and plays ONE song in that playlist , or sometimes it only recognizes a small handful of songs on a large playlist. Either way, it NEVER really works properly. Overall, It’s very glitchy with that music service, yet it advertises as being fully compatible and integrated with Apple Music.Also, while it’s tracking you, it can’t seem to handle multiple people in the room at once very well, and it gets all confused on who to follow and often turns the opposite way of who is watching it when someone quickly walks by, which is VERY annoying. It Happens ALL the time to us here! It’s become a bit of a family joke here actually. Good luck to those with this thing in busy households with kids, like ours.It does not go back to its standby idle position that you can set for it, for a whole 15 minutes. You may not realize it right away, but that is a long time for it to take, to go back to its original starting set idle position. This means for example, it will turn to respond to you when you are giving a verbal command at say, a sharp angle, and if you then move to a fixed position somewhere else in the room, it stays stuck where it was facing you earlier for a full 15 minutes before returning back to its starting set idle position unless you verbally direct it to move again by saying ‘Alexa’.  Amazon should Let us users be able to set exactly how long we want for it to take for the Show to go back to its set idle position!This thing often moves all over the place when it’s trying to determine exactly where I am while I’m giving it verbal commands, or while I’m typing on its screen. All this moving around and yet it very often still gets my exact position wrong. The ‘Alexa for your day’ screen is EXTREMELY annoying!!!  NOBODY wants this stupid screen that keeps popping up over and over again giving us useless Alexa command tidbits whilst interrupting our personal background pictures being shown. Please Give us the CHOICE to select whether we want this lame screen to appear or not, and don’t force it on us!Overall, It’s certainly not all puppy dogs and ice cream with this thing. It’s a fun, cool, and a neat concept. It’s very ambitious! Sadly, in my experience with it so far it’s been very buggy, and needs some updates very quickly with some big changes and fixes. I’m Still on the fence here.

The instructions weren't super clear on how to play we set it up followed the instructions to the best of our ability and packaged it back up pretty quickly. Not sure it was interesting enough to bring it back out to be honest. Loved the idea of a fnaf themed board game but I think it's too complicated especially for younger fans

Great board game
Reviewed in Canada on April 28, 2021Verified Purchase
My son was very excited for the game to arrive, and it did not disappoint!  Rules are straight forward and we were able to get going pretty quickly.  There's options to play the game alone, or with one other player.  Language and themes are toned down a bit for younger players.  Lots of fun, and would definitely recommend for anyone who likes Five Nights at Freddy's.

It is still a really good scent, though it’s a steep price. If you want to smell really good it’s one of the best colognes you can buy. Personally I would put in my Top 3 colognes. I would recommend getting the EDP (Eau de Parfum) instead as it’s much stronger and lasts much longer.

This over the Beyerdynamic DT 990 PRO, DT 900 PRO X, Sennheiser HD660S2 and HD660S
Reviewed in Canada on May 25, 2023Style: HeadphonesVerified Purchase
I've tried the many ""Hifi"" headphones over the last couple of weeks after taking a dive into theses Hi definition headphones and to be honest, these are the best ones and the last ones I will be trying out.Here are the flags I've noticed that made me change and try a new pair everytime, until I bought these.Beyerdynamic,DT 990 PRO: wayyy too airy, like hissing at your ears. not comfy enough.DT 900 PRO: still a bit airy but with more low end, still the fit is not it. Comfortable factor got worst as the cans got smaller, its almost an on the ear headphone at that point.Sennheiser,HD660S: was nice at first but was a bit pricey for the sound I feel like, not worth the $650 CAD +taxHD660S2: same thing, was nice at first with a very similar sound to the HD660S, better slick design with the goldy touches but wtf, $800 +tax lolAnd then the HD600, still not an average headphone for the price but, it fits and sounds like a very good set of cans. Comfort it's the same as the S series since it's the same band. Sound is less bassy than the S series and with a more neutral sound. Price is way lower than the S series and still, I ended up staying with them. Most of the time, it won't be the most expensive ones. Lesson learned here.This was decided with music and gaming in mind btw.If you're still debating between the HD600 and HD660S, it's like a sidegrade for less treble/very highs and more general low end. The price does not justify the S series tho, just EQ if you wanna slightly adjust the HD600 and you've pretty much bought an HD660S. A few programs can do that, search.Also be careful with headphones on amazon, there's a bunch of returns that have been used for a bit, not cleaned up, scuffed ones and they will end up in your hands. Thanks for the experience amazon.

the audio quality is great on my onboard offering (ALC1150 + 600Ohm built in ...
Reviewed in Canada on October 28, 2015Style: HeadphonesVerified Purchase
Edit: As an update to my review below the HD600's I purchased are much better when combined with an AMP / DAC, I paired them with an O2/ODAC from MassDrop and the difference is enough to make the experience more enjoyable than the vanilla setup I had with my motherboards DAC / Amp combo.----------TLDR: Definitely a step up from the M50, the audio quality is great on my onboard offering (ALC1150 + 600Ohm built in headphone amp) however the color isn't overly appealing and the standard cable feels like cheap crap I could buy from a dollar store. I would definitely recommend the HD600's still however in the future I hope an HD601 could be revised with a better cable / color scheme.I enjoy high quality audio, I had originally looked into the headphone market and was immediately told to try an Audio-Technica ATH-M50 and while it wasn't terrible after a year it started to be too bright for me to handle and cause me to exhaust my ears ability to listen to music after an hour or two. I searched for dozens of headsets over the whole year I owned my M50 and had settled on either the HD600 or HD650 and ultimately decided to go with the HD600 because I was able to get it as a lightning deal on Amazon out of pure luck after missing the lightning deal on the HD650.This review is being written while using the on-board audio on my Gigabyte Z97X-UD3H-BK which has a built in 600 Ohm headphone amp and the ALC1150 Codec / Audio Chip. I am upgrading to the Objective 2 / ODAC as I type this so while I wait I will have to settle for what I have.-----Audio Quality:The HD600 is definitely very neutral sounding on the treble side / bass side of things in comparison to the M50 which is definitely on the bright side and offers a larger thump in the bass areas of the music but you end up trading a lot of the mid section as a result. The HD600 on the other hand sounds natural, I'm hearing things in songs that I wasn't able to hear with my M50's over the last year or on any other pair of headphones I've owned in songs I've been listening to for upwards of a decade at times.I tested the HD600's with several different genres of music and I feel like it excels at anything with Piano, Violin, Trumpet or other classical instrument but I haven't disliked anything I've heard from the likes of A Perfect Circle, Tool, Trivium, Puscifer, Alexisonfire, Daft Punk, Mumford & Sons, Celldweller, Eric Prydz, GRiZ, Above & Beyond and Armin Van Buuren and the only place I feel like it lacks is in the bass end which is due to the year I spent with the M50's. I also feel like the HD600 also excels at anything with vocals in it which lends itself well to Trance or many forms of popular EDM with Dubstep and other electronic genres sounding very similar to the M50 minus the overpowering bass.The only downside to my purchase in terms of audio quality is that I feel like the HD600's are being held back by my lack of Headphone Amp / DAC which is why I'm purchasing the o2/ODAC from MassDrop in order to see if there are any differences between what I have now and what NwAvGuy brought to the audiophile community.Build Quality:The HD600 feels sturdy, the color of it isn't as appealing as it'd be if Sennhesier decided to go with a simple black color scheme but I guess I don't have to worry about anyone mistaking what headset I have with the current colors it sports but I'm looking into painting it myself at a later date. The one gripe I have with the build quality are the cables, they feel extremely low quality in comparison to what I imagined a $400 - $500 pair of headphones would have. The cord on the M50 in comparison feels much better, it's end connector (1/4th) is better with threading overall looks better on the headphones than the HD600's default cable but I guess that can be an upgrade at a later date.Comfort:I would not recommend this pair of headphones if you have extremely thick hair, they aren't overly comfortable with thick curly hair however once I cut it all off they definitely became fairly comfortable, more so than my M50's were at first and with time I expect them to get better. The top headband doesn't dig in as much as people in other reviews made it out to be and the ear cushions are stiff but have just enough give to contour to your face / jaw. In the future I may try additional ear pads to see if they make a difference in terms of comfort but I haven't had a problem wearing the HD600's for several hours at a time without breaks,Value:If I had to do it all again I would still consider the HD600 however without trying the AKG K7XX's I believe they would also offer a similar value for their price ($200) and would definitely consider them over the HD600 if a Canadian supplier can be sourced to avoid huge import fees and shipping fees. I feel like what I purchased is definitely worth it, the only thing I believe could be better is the cord.

Just like its name says, the mouse is super, super light and it felt like an empty and hollowed-out dummy unit for customer display when I first picked it up. It's the lightest mouse I've ever laid my hands on and it took me a little while to get used to its surreal lightness. That's not to say, however, that the mouse feels cheap. Due to Logitech's excellent design, the mouse cups underneath my hand like a second skin, feeling very ergonomic and comfortable.For the type of games I play, which are mostly FPS and third-person action RPGs, the number of buttons provided proved adequate and satisfactory. MMO players, on the other hand, might wish for more. The left and right-click buttons, as well as the two left-side buttons all worked just fine. The scroll wheel, which has good resistance, performed well, with no over-, under- or laggy scrolling. It's tuned perfectly out-of-the-box and I have no complaints.I'm already familiar with Logitech's G Hub software and I'm glad the company is keeping the design and navigation within it simple and elegant. There aren't many customization options for the G Pro X Superlight because it comes with a minimal number of buttons (five) and no LED light colors to change, which is fine by me. But it's in here that you can toggle among the various DPI settings. Thanks to the awesome HERO sensor, the dpi can be set as high as 25K! My reflexes aren't that good so I usually have it set way lower when playing slower-paced third-party action RPGs and I crank it up a bit for FPS games like Cyperpunk 2077. You'll have to play around with the dpi slider until you find the setting that is most comfortable and appropriate for your usage scenario.It's only when I'm not gaming and using the mouse for web browsing and productivity tasks that I wish there was at least one or two more programmable buttons - a dpi-changing button and a general-purpose button underneath the scroll wheel. On my other computer mice with more buttons, I usually set the button underneath the scroll wheel to launch a keyboard shortcut, such as CTRL + W (close tab). If I had a dedicated dpi-changing button, then I could be saving some time by not having to launch G Hub and setting a different dpi value. But all of this is really nitpicking and missing the point since the G Pro X Superlight is specifically tailored for hardcore and pro-level gamers.All in all, I'm more than pleased with the Superlight. It is feather-light, very ergonomic and perfectly suited for hours-long gaming sessions, ultra-precise and accurate, and has really long battery life. The price tag is quite high but I can definitely see this mouse being worth it for both serious and casual gamers alike. It's an absolute 5-star win!

The Logitech G Pro Superlight is a gaming mouse that lives up to its name, delivering a superlative gaming experience that has left me genuinely impressed. From its featherlight design to its precision performance, this mouse has elevated my gameplay to new heights.First and foremost, the weight of the G Pro Superlight is a game-changer. It's astonishingly light, making it feel like an extension of my hand rather than a peripheral. The absence of unnecessary bulk allows for lightning-fast movements, whether I'm engaging in rapid flick shots or executing precise maneuvers in a strategy game. Logitech has truly redefined what it means to have a lightweight gaming mouse.The design is not just about weight – it's also about comfort. The ambidextrous shape accommodates various grip styles, and the smooth curves provide a natural feel during prolonged gaming sessions. The mouse glides effortlessly on any surface, thanks to Logitech's Hero sensor, which delivers impeccable accuracy and responsiveness. I've experienced no lag, stutter, or jitter during intense gaming, giving me the confidence that my every move translates seamlessly in-game.The customizable buttons are strategically placed, allowing for quick access to essential commands without any accidental clicks. The minimalistic design doesn't compromise on functionality, and the lack of excess buttons adds to the overall clean aesthetic.The battery life is exceptional, lasting through extended gaming marathons without needing frequent recharging. The Powerplay compatibility is a notable feature, enabling wireless charging while in use. It's a small detail that adds a layer of convenience for those who prefer a wireless setup.Logitech has also nailed the build quality. The Superlight feels sturdy and durable, capable of withstanding the rigors of competitive gaming. The PTFE feet contribute to the smooth glide, ensuring that the mouse remains responsive and precise even under heavy use.

Back to basics
Reviewed in Canada on December 11, 2023Colour Name: WhiteStyle: Generation 2Pattern Name: MouseVerified Purchase
As mentioned in the headline, I'm back to basics with this mouse.  It's super light, it's white, it's wireless. It doesn't weigh a lot compared to my old Corsair Glaive. At 60g, the mouse is speedy and responsive—excellent tactile feedback with the buttons and scroll wheel. The plastic body has zero rubber side grips, which my Glaive has; after two years of wear, holding the Glaive felt gross and sticky with the rubber sides. However, the Superlight 2 does come with non-slip tape/stickers if you need extra grip.I probably could have gone with a flashier, cheaper, all-plastic mouse, but at the end of the day, the features of this mouse outweigh any of the other alternative mice I was looking at.On-board memory for profile switching between my laptop and desktop, weight is ultra-light. The Glorious Model O comes in at 59g (wired/RGB/black), but I wasn't into the RGB lighting and the Cooler Master MM710 at 52g (wired/black). It's ultra-lightweight, white, wireless and has no RGB; the Superlight 2 quickly met all my requirements.A downside to this mouse is the lack of ambidexterity, as there are no right-side buttons, a super long charging cable, and a missing dedicated DPI button. Switching DPI is through the G Hub software.It's pricey, but I can see this mouse lasting me a long time. Worth the investment, in my opinion.

Amazing Value for the Price

I recently purchased the 128GB SanDisk micro SD card for my Nintendo Switch, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. This little card offers an incredible amount of storage for the price, making it unbeatable for expanding your Nintendo Switch game library past the low starting storage.With 128GB of storage, I can now download and store a plethora of games without worrying about running out of space. The installation was a breeze, just pop it into the slot, and the Switch recognized it instantly.Now, I can have all my favorite titles at my fingertips, from massive open-world adventures to indie gems, without having to constantly delete and re-download games. It's made gaming on the Switch much more convenient and enjoyable.The SanDisk micro SD card not only offers ample space but also maintains speedy load times, ensuring a smooth gaming experience. For the price, this card is a must-have accessory for any Nintendo Switch owner looking to expand their gaming horizons. It's a fantastic investment, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

Replacement of the original
Reviewed in Canada on October 1, 2021Verified Purchase
I bought this to replace my original copy of the game. While the disc itself worked as expected, there was a noticeable difference in the quality of the case plastic & inserts. This one was cheaper compared to the original, and this one did not include the instructions booklet which came with the original. However, since the game itself worked as intended and that's what's most important, I'm satisfied.

Great cable - just make sure to plug it in properly
Reviewed in Canada on January 22, 2018Verified Purchase
Great cable. I have a Canon Vixia HFR300 and it fits just fine. The ten foot length is a great bonus because you can stand far back from your TV set and still comfortably use your camcorder.Just a short note - make sure you push the cable all the way into your device safely. I hooked it up the first time and I was being delicate with it and didn't want to damage my camcorder or the new cable. I didn't push it in far enough and I kept getting disconnected from my TV. At first I was holding my camera and cable at certain angles in order to maintain the image on the TV. After about a dozen tries, the cable slipped further into my camcorder slot ... it was then I realized that I hadn't pushed the cable far enough into the camcorder. Now the connection is fine, the picture is great, cable works, doesn't disconnect and works just as promised.So just make sure you have the cable attachments fully inserted into the HDMI slot of your TV and the connector slot of your device.

Great phone, came brand new in box without any imperfections or defects. Has a great battery life, charges up quickly, great screen and sound quality, overall an amazing phone for the price. Pretty comparable to a Samsung.My only issues stem from the Google UI being rather unintuitive and needing a 3rd party app to make it more suited to my own needs. The finger print reading is hit or miss and most times I just end up putting in my pin because it wont read.

The best phone you can buy dollar for dollar
Reviewed in Canada on February 1, 2023Colour: ObsidianVerified Purchase
**PLEASE READ**THIS PHONE DOES NOT COME WITH A CHARGER!!  If you already own a Pixel phone then this will not be an issue, as your 12V charger and USB-C cable are compatible with the Pixel 7; however, if you are coming from another type of phone that is not a Pixel then you will have to buy your own 12V charger.  The box comes with a USB-C cable, and USB-C plug for those who prefer to charge their devices with a computer.Besides the lack of a 12V charger, the phone is very responsive and has outstanding software for the price.  Out of the box, I don't think there's a better phone in the same class as this.One glaring issue that I'm trying to solve right now is the fact that the fingerprint reader seems to be having trouble reading my print.  I've done a reset which seems to have worked for now, but it's a noticeable issue - especially coming from a Pixel 4A; that has 0 issues with fingerprint reading.Battery life is good, though I wish it could have been equivalent to the 7 Pro considering the lack of a 12V charger.  Still, I can't complain as it's better than what I currently have.All in all, the phone is solid for the price.  I recommend it to anyone in the market for a new phone.

            **PLEASE READ**THIS PHONE DOES NOT COME WITH A CHARGER!!  If you already own a Pixel phone then this will not be an issue, as your 12V charger and USB-C cable are compatible with the Pixel 7; however, if you are coming from another type of phone that is not a Pixel then you will have to buy your own 12V charger.  The box comes with a USB-C cable, and USB-C plug for those who prefer to charge their devices with a computer.Besides the lack of a 12V charger, the phone is very responsive and has outstanding software for the price.  Out of the box, I don't think there's a better phone in the same class as this.One glaring issue that I'm trying to solve right now is the fact that the fingerprint reader seems to be having trouble reading my print.  I've done a reset which seems to have worked for now, but it's a noticeable issue - especially coming from a Pixel 4A; that has 0 issues with fingerprint reading.Battery life is good, though I wish it could have been equivalent to the 7 Pro considering the lack of a 12V charger.  Still, I can't complain as it's better than what I currently have.All in all, the phone is solid for the price.  I recommend it to anyone in the market for a new phone.

First the dislike: Shipping was quick but packaging was poor (see photo), the phone box was loose in the carton thus flying around in there. Can’t be good.The phone works as expected. The transfer of data etc from my Pixel 2XL was easy and quick. Even though not quite complete. I recommend to read the tips for the new phone, otherwise it is much the same as the old one, just faster. I changed all the wallpapers and icon appearances just to get the “new” feel. The battery charge lasts a lot longer. The camera is awesome and the additional features are appreciated. I am sure there is more to discover as I go along. Overall I can highly recommend the Pixel7.

Reviewed in Canada on December 12, 2023Colour: ObsidianVerified Purchase
When my iPhone 8 finally gave up the ghost, it was time to make a decision. Spend nearly a thousand dollars for a new Apple phone or make the move to the Pixel with an unbelievable Cyber Monday deal. I chose the latter and haven't looked back since.Yes, it took a while to get used to the differences between iOS and Android, but the learning curve has been relatively easy and smooth.The phone is fast, the battery lasts way more than a day of my typical use, and I have experienced zero issues with the fingerprint reader or the face recognition.I'm glad I made the switch and saved myself a lot of money in the process.

The most expensive and the worst phone that I have ever owned
Reviewed in Canada on September 19, 2023Colour: ObsidianVerified Purchase
This touch screen on this phone is unresponsive a lot. The trouble shooting guide says to restart it when that happens. REALLY! Say I have spend a lot of time purchasing something online and it freezes. So I reboot and lose everything and start all over. What if there is a time limit to what I am doing or this is the last one and it is gone after I reboot this piece of junk. The support is awful. I looked up my order and tried to go into support but it is completely useless as far as being able to get anything done to exchange this thing or return it under warranty. Do yourself a favour and don't buy this phone. The battery life sucks, the charging is very slow on top of it doesn't work way too often. $700 for the worst phone of at least 20 that I have had over the years. If another from the seller reads this please get in contact with me. The next step will be to try to get a hold of customer support at Amazon but that is nearly impossible!!

Reviewed in Canada on March 23, 2024Colour Name: BlackStyle: MascaraVerified Purchase
I have almost invisible lashes unless I wear mascara. Since I have sensitive eyes most mascaras irritate after about an hour but I really need to wear a mascara so I came across L'oreal telescopic mascara.  I really like the slim application brush that gets to even the smallest lashes. It really makes my lashes look long with just one application although it is buildable and so far hasn't irritated my eyes. I will certainly purchase this product again.

Fun and challenging
Reviewed in Canada on November 27, 2023Platform for display: Nintendo SwitchVerified Purchase
My daughter bought this game, and it's fun... Regardless of how coordinated you are, you'll find something in the game. Several (40) songs for dance to, with the option of accessing more ($). Songs have 1 por more coaches (people on screen), so you can do a choreography with friends along the way - not just play head to head. You also have the option of saving songs on your memory card so you can play without Internet access.My biggest criticism is that the user interface can be daunting at times, as there are multiple menus and multiple options to fiddle around with.We have yet to try the online mode to challenges friends and family.Be aware that there is no cartridge, and you have to download it from the Nintendo store. You also need a Ubisoft account. Both are easy to set up.All in all a good purchase. I see many hours of fun in my daughter's future and her friends'.

Working on playing this game for over 2 hours. A lot of headache to finally get into the game and then none of the songs would work. Click on the song and it would just buffer for 2-3 minutes and return to the same screen with no song. Download some free content and they still wouldn’t work. Read online to delete and reinstall and it would fix it. Instead my code no longer works and the game is useless. Now we wait on support! What a great way to spend a Christmas evening.

Reviewed in Canada on March 1, 2024Pattern Name: Xbox/PCStyle: WheelVerified Purchase
Super easy setup and learning to use. This is my first ever steering wheel purchase and I really have nothing bad I can say about it. I've had it for quite some time now and it works great. There were minor hurdles here and there but ultimately it came down to the connectivity most of the time. Great force feedback the pedals work great but keep in mind the acceleration pedal has no resistance so it is VERY hard to tell how much it's down. I also hear a squeak from it every time I turn and hold it right. Not too sure what's up with that but you get used to it eventually.

The Logitech G920
Reviewed in Canada on May 24, 2017Pattern Name: Xbox/PCStyle: WheelVerified Purchase
Alright let's get startedI put this order in on May 19th, 2017 and the package was expected to arrive the following Thursday. However, it came two days earlier which is great for me.On receiving the package, I immediately noticed that it was left in the box that it would be sold in at a store. The G920 box looked noticeably damaged on the outside, (scuff marks, punctured holes) and it appeared as the box was already opened as the carboard tabs on the lid were ripped off. I was a little nervous that the G920 would be damaged, however to my dismay it was in perfect condition.One thing you'll notice about the package when you open it up, it doesn't come with a shifter, just the pedals and wheel which to me I feel betrayed but at the same time satisfied. I had read online that the shifter felt cheaper and of lesser quality (also looking at online reviews and unboxings) and its prone to be worn out. Regardless of this, I'll be sticking with the paddle shifters on the wheel and maybe in a month I'll buy a thrust master shifter.The wheel itself is very nice, leather and steel which makes it look and feel like a real steering wheel (however the size of the wheel seems a bit smaller compared to a replica size one). Pedals feel like they are the real deal, with the breaks having actual resistance when pushed down onto along with the clutch and gas pedal.Overall quality is high and well received.Onto the gaming portion. For now I'm playing Assetto Corsa for the PC and it's a little tricky to find what settings you are comfortable driving with. I am constantly fine tuning my settings so I am able to get the most out of racing and more importantly; drifting. You can also download the Logitech software that's comparable with the wheel, and have even more access to settings to fine tune your driving experience.In conclusion, the Logitech G920 stands out on the driving simulator market as an entry level of driving gaming, and it's currently affordable as it is/was $100 off on Amazon.

Worked great until it didn't but Logitech replaced it so all good
Reviewed in Canada on January 2, 2023Pattern Name: Xbox/PCStyle: WheelVerified Purchase
We had the wheel for a few months when it started to not auto-centre without first turning it all the way to the left before plugging it in.  It also kept moving the centre to the right and the force feedback was fighting any turn to the left past centre.But Logitech support was great and helped me to try to diagnose it - they wound up sending us a replacement free of charge.I like the feel of the wheel and pedals - the brake pedal is too stiff but there are lots of videos about how to modify that for free or cheap.  Our cheaper unit has a gear shift but fewer buttons, and only two pedals - I like to use manual transmissions in BeamNG.  I wish it powered over the USB rather than needing a seperate power supply.  Once everything works with G-Hub it is easy to adjust and use - easy enough for my kids or wife to hook up without the dad tech help.

Best bang for your buck
Reviewed in Canada on January 20, 2024Verified Purchase
We own Connetix and Picasso Tiles and I personally feel like Picasso Tiles actually have the same if not stronger magnetic hold than Connetix and Connetix are triple the price! The kids love the bright colours of the Picasso Tiles and they feel very durable in hand. I work in a childcare centre and have purchased several sets of these for use between 32 children and there have been no damaged pieces with daily and rough use. When they were on sale for 52.49 a set and knew I needed at least 2 boxes to add to my own collection. The only ""complaint"" I would have is that the colours you receive for some of the pieces aren't consistent box to box. One box would have 2 large pink squares for example and no green or purple and another would have only 1 pink but 2 green and a purple. Definitely MUST get multiple boxes to make more things. 100 pieces isn't as many as you think.

BEST REVIEW - READ AND WATCH VIDEO
Reviewed in Canada on May 15, 2021Verified Purchase




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 So I got motivated to make this review with video after seeing a bad review with the video that was 100% not accurate. The complaints are that these are not strong magnets. We have Magformers and we prefer Picasso. Magformers are strong magnets. You can make a cube and play catch with it without it breaking. But can you build a huge castle with Magformers in 3 seconds? Nope! Picasso as you see in my video is not made to make a structure and move the structure. Simply not strong enough. What Picasso is made for is building whatever your child imagines. We have made a car garage. We have made the Paw Patrol tower. We have made buildings with shelves that we called a library. It’s endless the possibilities. These tiles are the best out there. We have two boxes. First box was $50 second box $55 and now they are $60. There was a time where they shot up in price. Today I just ordered two more. Yea 4 boxes in total - 400 pieces. Why? Because THIS IS THE MOST USED TOY ON THE SHELF. It’s mess free. Storage and clean up is easy. And most importantly SUPER FUN! Watch the video and see how easy they are to put together. And we love to knock them down and start all over. We’ve had ours for two years now and still look new. So super durable. We’ve had friends visit even adults and it becomes a group building activity. Buy 2 you won’t regret it! Highly recommend!!!

The AmazonBasics 9V battery is too big to fit into the housing of my CO2 detector and guitar tuner.While the AmazonBasics 9V battery fits into the compartment of my cordless mic and microphone mixer the terminal posts are too short to make contact and therefore won't power up these devices.So What's the Verdict?  There's no denying these AmazonBasics Batteries are a fantastic deal and if you're a Prime Member you get an additional 20% off bringing the cost per battery down to $1.37 each, compared to $3.24 each for Duracell 9V's.For my uses, I find the AmazonBasics batteries last about 70% as long as the Duracell's so when your factor in price and performance the AmazonBasics 9 Volts are a good value as long as they will fit and work in your device ... and that my friends is the magic question.The bottom line - I will continue to purchase and use AmazonBasics 9V batteries for the devices they will work in andUnfortunately I will still have to use the more costly name brand batteries for the devices they won't fit.

Reviewed in Canada on November 9, 2016Verified Purchase
I had read many reviews prior to purchasing this, and am confident I made the right decision.A few people had complained about it falling off or not really working properly, but this has not been my experience. Does it help not to have hair in that area? Yes. Perhaps that was the problem for some. I've put it on without using lubricant around the edges (as many have suggested is necessary), and it holds perfectly well. I'm wondering if some users had also expected it to cover the entire area, so felt it fell short for that reason... again, this has not been an issue for me. I may be slightly above average in size, too, and do not feel I need to use anything larger than this - positioning is key.

I used it once and got mediocre results, then it stopped working all together. Turns out it has because ""moisture"" was sucked up and clogged it. As that area often produces moisture I consider this a defect. I was able to get a refund by contacting customer service.

The ""cup"" part fits well and covers the entire vagina area.  My partner says that it made her feel tingly right away, and she is eager to use it again for longer periods of time.  If you are very visual you may want to get a clear model, as the pink is hard to see through.

Clean looking console, lots of fun to be had
Reviewed in Canada on May 22, 2023Edition: OLED Console White/Black Joy-ConVerified Purchase
What can I say, it's a Nintendo Switch! Lots of exclusive games you need this thing to play. Very happy with the purchase. I upgraded from a Switch Lite, and yeah I basically paid an extra 400$ to be able to play on a TV, but playing with the joycons is also a pretty nice experience.I don't really have much to say about the display, but I do like the fatter kickstand that the OLED model has compared to the original Switch. The colors on the joycons and dock are also a lot nicer in my opinion.

IMPRESSIVELY PORTABLE
Reviewed in Canada on February 28, 2024Edition: OLED Console White/Black Joy-ConVerified Purchase
It is insane how much data and games this console can hold while also being completely portable. Moving a traditional console usually is a hassle and quite overwhelming with all the different components and cables etc. But this is as easy as bringing a tablet with you! You can also add more space by buying an additional chip to slide into the Switch. This can boost your space to an insane about of capacity. In my case I added 256GB, but you most likely can even add 1TB!

From Switch Lite to Switch OLED
Reviewed in Canada on October 20, 2021Edition: OLED Console White/Black Joy-ConVerified Purchase
I first purchased the Nintendo Switch Lite for times when I travel. Even with a grip my pinky finger would go numb while playing longer that 10-15 minutes. This was very frustrating as I could not enjoy playing it. I purchased the Pro controller and a dock for my Switch lite so that I could play this way however, this presented a new problem. When you hold a Switch Lite, it is usually quite close to your face, making the smaller screen not that big of an issue, but now with the dock or stand, it was just always a little bit too far away from my face while using a dock/stand on Most surfaces to see the screen well enough. It was truly sapping out a lot of the enjoyment of the games I was playing - BOTW, Hollow knight, Super Smash Bros, Metroid Dread, Ninja Gaiden, Mario Odyssey, and some others.I have only had the OLED  for ONE DAY. I can easily see the screen when I put it on the stand on any surface level. My eyes feel so much more relaxed (I have 20/20 eyesight so my previous issues are not anything to do with my vision). I'll sell my Switch Lite and get a nice amount of my money back so this purchase also isn't even as expensive it was. The ability to set up to a TV is also a really nice reason to make the SWITCH (hehehe) if you're on the fence and in the same position in any way.Hope this Helps!

Was very skeptical buying 2 renewed iPhone 14 pro max gold phones. Both were like new, no scratches on front or back, battery on both were 100%. They came in generic boxes, both had different sim remove tools and not original chargers but that’s not why I bought the phones. Shipped to me in 4 days, regular shipping. Time will tell but they are excellent as described and we were not able to tell they were renewed phones. Aside from the price 1200$ each plus tax, it was a great purchase.

Was very hesitant buying refurb iPhone, happily tho everything worked out just fine. iPhone 14PM had 95% of battery life (really good) and ZERO scratches or dings anywhere, came with screen protector applied (didnt expect that) and all cameras perfect all functions (speakers mics, wifi, bluetooth, faceid) work as they should. Phone was already reset and ready to activate, which it did without issues. I hated the new colours on the 15 series and dont really care for USB C or anything like that as I have years of investments in lightning cables that work just fine. iPhone was shipped quickly and wrapped in bubble wrap in a box. Will keep this seller in mind for future purchases due to the great experience.

The tool is well designed and works as intended. The locking mechanism is very helpful but it is unknown how long it will last as it is constructed with plastic. The cost is low so can be replaced when it wears out. A metal heavy duty one would be even better

296,Fujifilm 16643000 X100V Digital Camera - Black,4.5,512 ratings,,"  Great Photography Every Day, Everywhere: X100V features a newly designed, incorporated 23mmF2 lens, ensuring you preserve those special moments at maximum resolution with minimal distortion. It also offers an improved close focusing performance compared to previous X100 models, and, for the first time in the X100 line, you can keep making images even in the toughest conditions when you attach the optional adapter ring with the weather-sealing protection lens (sold separately). This outstanding lens retains the same slim line design as other X100 models, so it retains compatibility with existing WCL and TCL lens attachments    Designed for Quality and Speed: From fleeting holiday moments and family celebrations to hard-hitting visual stories and ever-changing city streets, X100V has been designed to always deliver exceptional image and video quality. Creating a tool this capable takes powerful technology; that’s why Fujifilm’s state-of-the-art X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor and X-Processor 4 combination sits at this camera’s core. Pairing this exceptional, 26.1MP, back-side illuminated sensor and powerful quad-core CPU results in incredible quality, wide dynamic range, lightning-fast processing and precision AF performance, right down to -5EV    Two Ways to See an Image: To truly convey the magic of a scene, you need to be immersed in the moment and X100V’s advanced hybrid viewfinder gives you everything you need to do exactly that. At the flick of a switch, you can change between the X100V’s 0.52x magnification optical viewfinder (OVF), which uses parallax-correcting frame lines to let you see outside the shot, and its 3.69M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder (EVF), which gives you a real-time preview of your exposure. You can even get the best of both worlds by using the electric rangefinder function (ERF) to activate a mini EVF display within the OVF window    Frame the Perfect Image: X100V has been specifically tailored for photographers who are never without a camera by their side and always ready to frame a moment. The two-way, tilting LCD touchscreen is a perfect example of Fujifilm’s tailored design. This new technology within the X100V offers quick, intuitive controls and makes struggling to frame images from difficult angles a thing of the past. Furthermore, when folded flat it fits seamlessly into the camera’s slim line body, and in doing so, this sophisticated LCD touchscreen finds the perfect balance between functionality and portability    Movies on the Move: The X100V allows you to explore a whole new world of image making with the ability to create stunning 4K video at 30 frames per second. Additionally, super slow-motion footage can be recorded using the camera’s Full HD/120p setting, so you can relive details that would otherwise be missed by the naked eye. This professional-level quality is backed up by Fujifilm’s outstanding color reproduction technology and unique selection of in-camera film simulation modes, while those who need more fidelity can record 10-bit, 4:2:2 color via the HDMI port   ","['5 star81%', '4 star6%', '3 star3%', '2 star1%', '1 star9%']",,,"Electronics › Camera, Photo & Video › Digital Cameras › Point & Shoot Digital Cameras",$,"2,749.99","Gibson595.0 out of 5 stars
Superb Camera!
Reviewed in Canada on August 27, 2020Colour Name: SilverVerified Purchase
Incredible ""Jewel"" of a camera with stunning retro looks with modern appointments and excellent image quality.  It's almost the perfect camera in every way.  The build quality is fantastic and it feels so good in the hands.  It's an absolute joy to shoot with as well.  The updated lens is super sharp, even wide open and at close-up distances.  Everything is in the right place and the manual controls work so well.Image quality is fantastic and about as good as you can get out of a modern APS-C camera.  I no longer need to shoot in Raw as I find the jpgs to be more than adequate.  I enjoy the film simulations which are professional as opposed to other manufacturers simulations which are more ""gimmicky"" and ""toyish"".  No complaints in the image department.There are a few negatives though.  Gone is the 4 way controller and you're forced to have to swipe the rear screen to replicate the missing controller.  I'm not a fan of swiping as it's not as intuitive and there is some lag to the swipes.  Also not a fan of the recessed buttons because there harder to feel when you're looking through the viewfinder.  I like the buttons on the previous X100F model much better.

There are a lot to love about this camera
Reviewed in Canada on March 13, 2020Colour Name: SilverVerified Purchase
If you are looking for a multi purpose, compact, high performing, beautiful camera then you are at the right place.It is amazing how compact and feature packed is this camera. It is a fun to use with all mechanical tactile and compactness that makes you bring it anywhere.Having a fixed lens is also great as you do not spend a lot of money on lenses and carry them around. Instead you can concentrate on capturing the great moments of your life and your beloved ones.You can always buy wide or telephoto converters. I have a wide converter that I occasionally use for landscape photography.If you want to zoom you can digitally zoom and you will not be disappointed as image quality is great and new lens produces sharp and vivid images.I owned Fujifilm X100F and I loved it although there were a couple of missing features such as weather sealing and fast autofocus.I live in Montreal, Canada and weather can be harsh at times so having weather sealing is a great addition.Besides, camera is improved in many aspects. Faster and better autofocus, tilting touch-enabled screen, higher quality body build, and longer battery life are some of the improvements.In short, it is such a joyful and capable camera!

Great headphones at a price to match
Reviewed in Canada on February 27, 2022Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I bought this looking for comfortable headphones with good sound, and this pair was everything I was looking for (and more!).Comfort: The headphones rest lightly on your head without pushing down. The earcups are very soft and have ample room for your ears. The clamping pressure is almost non-existent and I can go 12+ hours with these on my head without any pain or irritation.Sound Quality: I am no expert on sound and how to describe it, but I feel like I am able to experience a wider range of sound wearing these (especially in the higher frequencies).Bluetooth: Easily connects to up to two devices (won't connect to more unless you remove devices using ""Bose connect"" app) with no noticeable latency. Unfortunately the volume is fairly low on bluetooth (I usually listen to music at around 30-40% system volume with other headphones, but I needed to turn it to 60% with these to reach the same volume levels).This isn't a problem for me however, because I'm at my computer most of the time, and when using a wired connection, it's actually quite a bit louder (I only need to keep it at 16-20% for the same volume).ANC: The headphones already have good noise isolation due to their design, but the ANC also works very well at blocking out all sound. I can't hear people talking 6 feet away when I am listening to music. The ANC is also very nice when I am gaming, since my fans can get pretty loud on my desktop. When the headphones are connected through wire, ANC is permanently on, so you can switch the headphones off to save battery if you don't need the ANC.For me, the only downside is the cost. I got it on sale for $280 CAD, but I would say it is worth it for its longevity (according to online reviewers) and comfort. I am extremely careful with my headphones, and the last pair of headphones I had ($80 Skullcandy Crusher 2014) lasted me 7 years before the earcups completely wore down and it started getting uncomfortable, so I am hoping these will last me much longer.tl;dr: A comfortable pair of closed-back over-ear headphones with great ANC. However, it might not fit everyone's budget.

Nice sound, battery only 20h, only connects to 2 other devices
Reviewed in Canada on November 10, 2020Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
First off, I can wear this thing all day comfortably. I have a large head. The pressure is noticeable, but tolerable. The material is nice. The top part is soft, so people with no hair will enjoy that. A little on the heavy side, I find, but I don't notice any neck fatigue after wearing them, but it's something to consider if that can be an issue for you. They do not slip off if I tilt my head.They seem rather durable. Haven't tried it, but they'd likely survive a fall from a table or chest-height. Big hinges, proper screws and all motions are smooth. The power off button doubles as Bluetooth discovery mode. Button feels fragile, honestly, but with the auto-off from the app, and not needing to connect devices repeatedly, I only used it a few times. However, it can only store 2 connections. So if you have a PC, phone, and TV... Uh oh.The sound is good. I'm not an audiophile, as I had a twenty bucks Sony pair before this, but it sounds a little smoother maybe. There is no equalizer settings, which is a bummer for an expensive set. Max volume is very loud, and can damage hearing if used. Use the ""Quiet on the Set"" app on PC if this is a concern.There's an assistant button, but the phone assistant has to be active first, so what's the point? On its own, it can't even understand most vocal commands, like power off, mute or the like without the brains of the cell. The word ""connect"" activates Bluetooth. But the cell can manage the device, which is nice. The app lets you turn off either of the two connections, so if one is dropping frequently, you can switch it off.It has Bluetooth 4, which doesn't have the low latency codecs 5 has, but is alright. There seems to be a microsecond delay between pushing play on a YouTube and the sound going out, but I don't think it's noticeable to most humans during speech? I don't, anyway. Gamers may notice however, so a note of caution if that's your thing. Of course, there's no surround sound, so some movie watchers may be turned off by that. These are good, and made for, music listening.The noise cancelling is very good. Most reviews say the latest Sony pair is better at that, but it's less expensive. I can't barely hear the computer fan or other low sounds. With music on, I can't hear someone speaking nearby. It has 3 settings, off, mid and high. With mid, someone can speak to me and I'll hear them, while still blocking out most fan noise. Perfect.It does not leak sound.The battery is the weakest point : you can get 40h headphones for less than 50$ nowadays. I plug them in when I wake, make breakfast and etc and they're powered on for most of the day afterwards. They run out of juice if I stay up late (which I shouldn't do, but it can happen).The USB-C port is standard, and that standard is flimsy. It's like that industry wide now. You know what they say : if all your friends jump off a cliff... so they should go to either back to jacks, USB-A, or try something new. A mm thick ""tongue"" piece is all that stands between us and the loss of expensive electronics. Madness.I got these as a treat for myself.

Reviewed in Canada on December 25, 2020Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
These really are made to be used with an Android device and with Bluetooth. They will work with a computer wirelessly if it has Bluetooth sure, but it's not a great experience. If you try to use it as a headset, it will sound pretty bad, I understand this is mostly a Bluetooth limitation, but it's something to keep in mind. There also is no real way of turning off the noise cancellation while using them with Bluetooth, but you can when you use them with a wire. However the cable doesn't connect to the microphone built into the headset, so it's headphones only when using it in wired mode.They do sound great if you just use a wire or use them as just headphones via bluetooth.Latency with the headset has been pretty good, I can perceive a delay with the devices I've tried them with, but it's not bad, of course when used wired, this isn't a problem at all.They are extremely comfortable to wear for me, I have a big head and I wear glasses all the time with them, and the physical pressure isn't bad. They really are comfortable to wear, and live up to the QC. The Noise cancelation is probably the best in this price bracket, and honestly most devices that are more expensive barely do it better if at all.I've been a long time user of mostly Sennheiser products, but when it comes to noise cancelation, Bose is hard to beat, especially for the price.

I bought a five pack c/w sync module when the cloud storage was free and they work reasonably well, the battery life is quite impressive, in fact they are still using the included batteries and it's now ~2.5 years.  However, I discovered that the scheduling feature works at the module level rather than the camera level and I wanted the rear cameras to operate at night while the front camera should operate 7x24, which I could not do.  So ... I bought the doorbell c/w a second sync module and moved the front camera to the 2nd sync module along with the doorbell.  In the meantime Blink now charges for the cloud storage and the subscription price is in my view far to expensive @ $150 CAD per year.  I added a flash drive to the 2nd sync module to store the clips and this is the primary reason for my headline ""Has a few issues"".  Retrieving clips from the local storage is painfully slow relative to the cloud storage, there are no thumbnails and you can only delete them one at a time, which is a slow process.  These cameras including the doorbell do not have face recognition or AI capability and I found the zoning doesn't seem to work very well on the doorbell as I keep getting clips of our plants moving in the wind despite zoning them out and I tried multiple times to configure this feature.  Thankfully, we don't have many windy days here.  Also, the notification response time varies quite a bit, from literally a few seconds to perhaps 30-40 seconds occasionally.  Overall, for the price I would say that the product is pretty good, and it has been reliable and integrates well with our existing electronic door chime.

Not useful as an actual doorbell.  Batteries last 4 Months at most.
Reviewed in Canada on December 17, 2023Colour Name: BlackStyle: Doorbell SystemConfiguration: Video DoorbellVerified Purchase
Have had the Blink Doorbell with sync 2 module for about 2 1/2 Months now.The Blink Doorbell is not actually very useful as a Doorbell.  The app takes about a minute to 3 minutes or a bit more to connect to it when someone rings it.  By that time they have given up and left.Also when viewing the clips it takes a long time to load them with a message that says ""USB Clips Take a little longer to load""  This makes absolutely no sense.  Clips from local USB on my own network should load faster than clips from an internet server.  The only reason I can see for this is that Blink purposefully slows them down to try to convince you to sign up for their subscription service.I had to install it very low on my door and also sideways because the field of vision is much wider than it is vertical.  So I had the choice of seeing 1. Who is at my door (But not packages on the ground in front of it) or 2. Packages on the ground in front of my door (But not face(s) of who is at the door.  Or the one I opted for.  3.  Install the camera sideways and a bit low on the door in order to see full view of who was in front of the door and also packages on the ground in front of my door.This is a poor design in my opinion.  The Camera should have had a better vertical field of view.There is a lag between motion detection and the camera recording so you always miss the first few seconds of any motion activated recording.It's probably good enough of a security system for me to see if anyone messes with any packages in front of my door but that's about it.I would have regretted purchasing this item more if I hadn't gotten it on a 50% off sale and would definitely not purchase it at regular price.  Not even too sure I would purchase it again at 50% off.Blink disables some function that should work just fine such as saving live views to the local USB storage because I opted out of purchasing their subscription service.Still though they are one of the few doorbell camera systems that offers a local storage option at all so I have added 1 Star for that.The picture is pretty clear and the night vision seems ok as well (I always have a light on at my front door so not generally fully dark.)I put a 256GB USB storage in the Sync Module and that may have been overkill as it has never gotten over 1% full.  I stopped deleting clips about a month or two ago and it records all motion at my front door (Which includes my neighbours going back and forth 20 - 30 times a day lol.The Battery level just says ""OK""  Would be nice if it had a percentage or something so I knew how ""OK"" it is?  Not sure what it will go to from ""OK""?Hopefully they will update something with firmware or something to that the doobell function is not totally useless.  The Doorbell is about 20' from my router through one wall (& Obviously the door of course).  So there is no reason why the signal should not be strong enough to produce a much better experience.Update: Now after only 4 Months the very expensive Li-Ion batteries are dead.  The camera does activate about 5 - 10 times a day but that should not reduce the rated ""2 year"" down to 4 Months.  These batteries are incredibly expensive.  At this rate the batteries are going to cost me almost what the subscription I was trying to avoid would.  NOT impressed at all and would not purchase again nor recommend.

Works like a charm
Reviewed in Canada on November 20, 2023Style: Brushed ModeVerified Purchase
Works well once installed. The hose part is just long enough for its intended purpose, although I would have liked it a bit longer to spray-rinse my tub after taking a shower/bath - tub is on opposite side of my bathroom. Should be long enough if your tub is beside the toilet.Note: if the bidet's T-valve needs to be installed behind the toilet, then if the toilet is too close to the wall it may be difficult to access the area. Make sure your hand can reach easily behind and loosen/tighten the nut, and with a wrench if needed too. My toilet is the American Standard Studio Skirted Two-Piece Duel Flush Elongated (smaller than normal due to tiny bathroom space), so I had to move the actual toilet to attach the bidet due to the way the toilet is made plus next to no room between the toilet and the wall. Would be easily to attach if the access to your toilet tank was on the side or somewhere easily accessible.The product itself works well, seems well made, no problems!

Excellent Product
Reviewed in Canada on October 23, 2023Style: Brushed ModeVerified Purchase
I have had our bidet system in place now for a few years and our family would not go without it. Especially, since our granddaughter has started using it regularly. We have had no issues such as water leak. We have enjoyed our setup so much at our home in the suburbs that I have also purchased one for our family cottage. This will be installed in the new bathroom and when we refinish our old bathroom we will be also be purchasing another setup tp be installed in there as well. The only thing to be aware of is that this system is hooked up directly to your cold water. Therefore, at the beginning getting use to the shock of the cold spray was challenging. But over time like anything else we have become accustomed to that inital shock. I am also cognizant that our bidet helps us to be environmentally conscious because it affords us to use less toilet paper. Along with feeling refreshed when we are finished using the toilet. Especially, in the cases where number 2 is the reason for visiting the WC. You can also use the hand held spray nozzle to help with the cleaning of the toilet as well.With all this in mind I would highly recommend the bidet because the install is relatively easy, quick and for those of us concerned about minimizing our footprint on the environment this is also a perfect solution.

Do not purchase! Will flood your bathroom.
Reviewed in Canada on August 30, 2023Style: Brushed ModeVerified Purchase
Three strikes and you're out. This bidet hose has flooded our bathroom three times now and I've removed and thrown it in the trash.The first two times it flooded, I replaced all the teflon tape, made sure all the connections were secure. This last time I discovered the leak is not coming from the junctions, but from the internal head of the sprayer. There's nothing you can do about the internal parts—they're trash manufacture. That means any time the bidet valve is left open, it will leak from the sprayer. It says you should not leave the valve open when not in use, but in a house with kids, it is inevitable that at some point, someone is gonna leave the valve open. The sprayer cannot withstand normal household water pressure for even a short period and will immediately leak.Stay away from this piece of trash!

Love this hand held bidet
Reviewed in Canada on September 11, 2023Style: Brushed ModeVerified Purchase
I love this. I had read in reviews that some people were finding it leaks, so I have been sure that I always push the lever down after use, to close the valve. It has never leaked for me. I placed a little tray under the lever and toilet just in case, but in the 14 months that I've had it, it has not leaked.It wasn't difficult to set up. You turn off the water to the toilet. You unscrew the hose from the water to the toilet. You screw this device's hardware inbetween and reattach the toilet hose. I made sure to turn this so the lever points towards the front as opposed to the side. It's easier for me to just flip the water-supply lever up and down that way.It's not just for keeping yourself clean. Since my toilet is next to the bathtub, I have used it to rinse the tub after I've scrubbed it. I have also used it to clean dirty and dusty items that had a lot of grime. I just plunk the dirty storage container, the outdoor step stool, whatever, into the tub and hose it down with this. The flat lever on the nozzle easily controls the flow from soft to hard. Your water pressure would really be what ultimately determines how hard the spray will be, but my average apartment water pressure, flat lever pressed all the way down, is more than enough to sluice layers of dirt from a white plastic step stool that was left to disappear into the black hole that was my uncle's garden shed. It would have been good to film it for one of those ""Satisfying to watch"" videos you see on social media.And for your soft areas, you just don't press the flat lever on the nozzle very hard. Practice a little before using it on yourself if you're nervous.Before I got this, I had been using a long nozzled little watering can to clean off after the bathroom. Pandemic toilet paper shortages did not affect me at all. But this gadget means I don't have to constantly be refilling a mini watering can. I have a metal over-the-tank shelving unit and I hook the flat lever of the nozzle over one of the crossbeams instead of the hook provided in the box.It's such a great gadget that even though I don't need another one, I feel like getting another one anyway, just because I like it so much.

This wonderful little bottle will become your best friend, from the moment you give birth and for a few weeks afterwards as you heal. Yes, the hospitals may provide one to you, but it is not as good as this one, and this one is far more reliable than the hospital inexpensive one. This bottle is obviously not free, but it is well worth the price. It is very good quality, and you can wash it and store it for the future if need be. I highly recommend this to all new moms, to be added into your hospital bag. It is one of the best tools you can buy for yourself or to gift a mom to be for her birthing journey.

Despite the recommendation for warm water, I found that using cold water provided an even more soothing sensation, easing the discomfort effectively.

Lasts for about 3 days and stops the curls from getting tangled or matted. You can refresh the curls the next day with a little water from a spray bottle. Doesn't make the hair crunchy and does not dry out the hair. It's expensive but it's worth it.

Quality Custard
Reviewed in Canada on March 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Being a big fan of Kinky Curly products i was very excited to try their curling custard.I was very impressed with the cast the custard leaves, its quite strong and holds throughout the day. This is a solid product when paired with the Kinky Curly Knot today leave in conditioner. I haven't tried this custard with any other products so i cant give an honest opinion about that.The trick for my is applying the conditioner to wet hair and then applying the Kinky Curly Curl Custard gel immediately after. This will leave a nice cast and lock in the moisture from your conditioner. You can then choose to leave the hard cast or break the cast and have more looser curls that are still together.Overall its a good product and decent value.

I always come back to this product
Reviewed in Canada on April 2, 2021Verified Purchase
I have stopped using this product from time to come, to try other (cheaper) things. A little goes a long way. Works best on wet hair and after using Knot Today leave in. This is important. It is stick and will be too sticky if the hair is not wet. Smooth it through the hair with the fingers and it is frizz free for days, and it feels soft and shiny. I used to wet my hair daily using other products. I have been sporting the same wash and go for the past 4 days without reapplying product or setting my hair. It’s worth the cost to have clean, botanical based hair products that work. You get what you it for. I’m not so into hair typing, for for those that are I am between a 4c and 4b. I have medium porosity hair.

Excellent Headphones
Reviewed in Canada on February 25, 2019Size: 250 OHMColour Name: GrayVerified Purchase
Wanted to review based off of my application as it was difficult to find any comments or reviews for how I would be using these headphones and there is a lot of negative reviews on the web on driving high impedance headphones off of home theater receivers. My use will primarily be off of my Marantz SR7009 receiver headphone jack for music, gaming, and movies/tv after the kids go to bed. I tested the 80ohm and 250ohm side by side in all scenarios and ultimately went with the 250ohm version as my receiver has no issues driving these headphones. In my opinion the 250ohm version sounds far superior then the 80ohm variant, much larger sound stage with excellent definition in particular at the high end. Both pairs are extremely comfortable to wear for hours on end and the build quality is superior to many other headphones even at higher price points.Live music and acoustic music hands down sounds better on the 250ohm version, the 80ohm version sounds noticeably flatter, however the 80ohm version can be driven louder due to the flatter highs which helps if you are looking for a little bit more bass out of these. On that note, the bass definition on these headphones is excellent and more then adequate for my listening preference, if you want a bass heavy headphone then go buy a pair of beats and sacrifice all other aspects of sound quality and stop complaining. Heavy metal/rock comes through great on these with no noticeable distortion at higher volumes and excellent definition in the mid range.Gaming with these is just fine, sound detail is amazing in particular on darker games like Resident Evil with lots of quiet creepy sounds coming through clear as day and first person shooters are just as good, albeit no built in mic. Movie dialog comes through sounding natural and overall no complaints here.  At $200 you will not find a better pair of headphones for a home theater type of application such as mine.

250 OHm version - If you love yourself, buy them!
Reviewed in Canada on May 8, 2020Size: 250 OHMColour Name: GrayVerified Purchase
I hope this review will help many... I've been an audiophile all my life, but never dated to spend more than 100$ on headphones. I got my 770 pro for 240$ at the time of this review. I love all genre of music. Hardstyle, tehcno, pop, kpop, 60, 70, 80 & 90s rock, R&B, dubstep, classic, you name it, I like it.With these headphones, every little bit of sound coming out of it is pure (make sure you download your music at the best possible quality). High and mids are particularly great as everybody says and the bass is, in my taste, perfect. Not taking over the vocals & melodies. I didn't notice how good the noise cancellation is good until my girlfriend yelled at me (couldn't hear her).Only cons is that you would probably need an amp to crank it up to its max potential, but if you buy 250 OHm version, you should know this information. Still 5/5

Reviewed in Canada on March 26, 2020Size: 250 OHMColour Name: GrayVerified Purchase
The headset noise cancellation is not electronic, it is hardware.So no gadget, just a really well built headset that removes -20db naturally.The sound with a proper amp is amazing (I use SMSL SAP-II with a Topping D10 Dac).I listen to classic, jazz, pop, movies and heavy metal and really I'm satisfied.The ear pads are removable and washable as far as I know and are also really soft for the ears.The clamping force is just right even for a big head like mine, so you can wear them all day no problem.Would buy again anytime. They will probably last more than 10 years, these are not flimsy.

Great headphones, bad delivery
Reviewed in Canada on October 17, 2023Size: 250 OHMColour Name: GrayVerified Purchase
These headphones are great. But they were delivered in such a way that seems careless (and they may have even been opened?) besides the slightly disturbing condition of the box, the headphones were thankfully unharmed. The sound of these headphones could be described as “bright” or even a bit “sharp” at times. The bass of these is weirdly flat, considering they are closed back headphones. I feel their strengths are soundstage and separation. If I had to recommend these headphones to any buyer, I’d say they’d be best for voiceover artist, vocalist’s, jazz listeners, and maybe gamers (as footsteps would be pretty clear on these). Overall, if you’ve got the amp to power these 250 ohm (you wont need an amp for the others, 80/32ohm) versions, there worth it for my application.

Best Headphones i've ever had!
Reviewed in Canada on August 6, 2021Size: 250 OHMColour Name: GrayVerified Purchase
These are by far the best headphones i've ever had. My review may not mean too much as these are my first studio quality headphones. The sound quality is by far superior to my gaming headsets. I've had a few and I always bought high quality spending roughly the same and these are much better. I did not buy the headset version of these because I have a stand alone mic. To any new people looking to buy studio headphones: you will need to buy an amp so it can be plugged into your pc as the jack is bigger. The amps don't seem to work on your tv, gaming system etc. These headphones will essentially only work on your pc and musical instruments. You will also need to download an equaliser which I highly recommend Peace. Otherwise you won't get much out of them. But you do these will be the best headphones you've ever had.

These headphones are amazing!
Reviewed in Canada on June 21, 2018Size: 250 OHMColour Name: GrayVerified Purchase
My first pair of headphone in the beyerdynamic line, and I'm very much impressed! I own Audio Technicas and Sennheisers, but I can almost say for sure these are my favorite headphones only after a day of use (that's coming from someone who uses HD800 on a daily basis!)I'm a diehard gamer, and I have AC in my room, so closed cans were one of my prerequisite, problem is, most closed cans are very uncomfortable and make your ears sweat, I also love the sound signature of my Audio Technicas, but they're so uncomfortable, so I feel the DT 770 Pro is an amazing choice for gamers with loud surroundings and who wish to use for extended period of times. I bought a modmic 5.0 for them, still waiting on that, but honestly these cans impress me a lot and they're awesome for gaming.Just remember that if you choose the 250 ohm version, you do need a decent amp to power them, I personally use a Mayflower O2/ODAC combo and it does the job! I'm thinking to go for a schiit stack in the future, but for now, this setup is great, and I highly recommend it to you!

This is how GTAV was meant to be!
Reviewed in Canada on February 15, 2016Platform for display: PlayStation 4Verified Purchase
I originally picked up GTAV for PS3 on launch day and although that version was a fun and amazing experience, it was limited by PlayStation 3's hardware capabilities. Despite this, Rockstar managed to give us an excellent game and some excellent DLC content for two strong years.  In July of 2015, GTAV for PS3 finally reached the end of the road as the DLC pack ""Ill gotten gains: Part 2"" was the final DLC to be made available for last gen systems and if players wanted any more new DLC, they would need to switch to next gen systems like PS4/Xbox1.  Like most people, I didn't like the idea of essentially being forced to switch if I wanted to continue to enjoy the new DLCs for this game but I knew it had to be done as last gen systems are now obsolete and can't keep up hardware-wise.If you've played the last gen version and is undecided on whether or not you should upgrade to the next gen version, there are a few things to keep in mind: First, there is much more content on the next gen version. More missions, more weapons, more features, etc. In-game radio stations have more licensed music, there are more vehicles available and the game even has a full first-person mode.  Secondly, Rockstar continues to add new DLC to the next gen version. With last gen consoles, support from Rockstar is LITERALLY non-existent now for GTAO.  There's no more DLC and online public lobbies have more and more modders running wild. Next gen lobbies are still pretty safe.  Thirdly, this game supports Remote Play so if you own a PS Vita, you can now play GTAV on it (amazing, right?). Finally, if you invested a lot of time and effort into your GTAO's character(s) on last gen, you will be happy to know that you can cross-platform transfer your characters, progress and money to the next gen version and continue where you left off.  (EDIT: As of March 6, 2017, PS3 owners can no longer transfer their save data to PS4.)A minor downside to this game is that you must pay to play online whereas last gen GTAO was and still is completely free to play. This normally shouldn't be a problem considering most next gen owners usually have income to spend but if you're on a fixed budget or prefer not to pay for PSN+ services, then you're out of luck with playing online with this game.Overall, if you own a next-gen system and enjoyed GTAO of previous gen, you should consider upgrading to this game if you haven't done so yet. The extra content, missions, feaures and DLC makes this game well worth the price.

Don't believe the hype
Reviewed in Canada on March 2, 2017Platform for display: PlayStation 4Verified Purchase
Wrote this review a while back, but never got around to posting it on here.An okay game. The biggest flaw is probably the online community.There are 2 types of players online: The level 1000 players who literally never stop playing the game that drive around in tanks destroying your vehicles and killing you whenever you spawn outside in free-roam, and the kids who are too young to be playing this game, and have their cheap $10 gaming microphones cranked while they scream at everyone or blast crappy dubstep or rap through their microphones, begging to be muted and blocked.If you played Call of Duty back in it's prime and remember all the kids that played those games and what they were like, you should know what to expect for the multiplayer in GTA V There are a lot of pointless game modes as well that make the game look more complete than it really is. Other than death-match and races, the rest of the game modes are pretty stupid or just don't belong in this type of game. The graphics are below average. Don't believe anyone that says this game looks amazing. If you want a graphically stunning game, this is far from it. The graphics aren't bad, but most recent games have way better graphics than this game.gameplay 7.5/10graphics 6.5/10multiplayer 7/10story 7.5/10overall rating 8/10

One of the best games of all time
Reviewed in Canada on February 19, 2016Platform for display: PlayStation 4Verified Purchase
I found myself feeling delighted while playing this game more often than with any other game.  It never takes itself seriously, and while the story is that of a pretty typical high budget American action movie, complete with improbable and irrational plot points, it's a ton of fun.  The game allows you at least two ways to go about most missions, which means you can go through it twice and still find new content.  The game looks beautiful, with amazing rendering and southern California vibe.  The map is absolutely huge and a joy to explore.  But, there are things I hate, like the optional scavenger hunts for stupid stuff, which can take a lot of time and effort but give little satisfaction and little reward.

What can I say, I love GTA V, I have it on PS4 and PC. I prefer the 60FPS of PC but I like the practicality of a console controller so the trade off is a 30FPS game. I believe it can run 60FPS if it deletes a lot of the updates but all in all, a great game but if you buy it now, it will show it's age fast. I recommend for story mode, PC and for Online, PS4 since it is more secure than GTA Online PC.

Live in Southern Ontario.  Bought these to take camping with us.  Tried it out in the backyard to see if it actually works.  I literally left it out all night to see what happened and to hopefully reduce the mosquito population in our backyard.  This is what it looked like in the morning.  I did the same the next night, at which point the battery died so needs to be recharged.  The light on it is extremely bright so would be good for playing cards or doing dishes in the dark while camping.  The UV light to attract mosquitoes is very dim but as you can see it obviously worked to attract the bugs at night to the lamp.  I bought a two pack so will be bringing those camping this summer.  Will write an update review when we return!  I haven’t cleaned it yet and there are no instructions on how to do that so I will need to Google and watch some videos on that in the future….

I love these little lights. I did find the shape odd, mostly because I was going to have it on my table outside and i wanted it to be sturdy, nlt rolling around. However, it actually stands well and when you hang it, it's actually really handy. The light/lamp can change brightness which has also been beneficial at times. Does a good job keeping the mosquitos at bay for such a little light. I would by again.

Good console
Reviewed in Canada on August 12, 2023Edition: OLED Console Zelda Special EditionVerified Purchase
I never owned a switch before so it is hard for me to comment in regards to past models. However, I found this to be a great console. I was a bit disappointed that it did not come with a copy of the Tears of the Kingdom at first. However I realize now it is quite a large game, and I can understand why it was not included. This is a nice looking unit, I am happy with the battery life which is probably an easy 10-12 hrs. I keep airplane mode on as much as possible, as I find the internet connection a hard drain on the battery. There is a bit of wiggle between the controllers and the screen itself, nothing too bad, I expect this is because the controllers are detachable. All in all, a good console.

Reviewed in Canada on July 6, 2023Edition: OLED Console Zelda Special EditionVerified Purchase
I'm not sure what people are complaining about the game not coming with this system for. It's only $10 - $20 more expensive than the basic Oled model. You really think your going to get a special addition system plus the game for $10-$20? Your dreaming. Or just very bad at math.The system is great, I wasn't a big fan of the controllers in the pictures, but I like them more in person. They are just not what I would normally consider my style, but they are very nice and well made. They have grown on me the longer I have them for. I love the metal backing, and the special design swirls. There is also a good amount of room in the doc to put a case on the system. There is actually so much room that you might want a case, I didn't actually like how lose it fit without one. But I'm happy to have the extra protective layer.Although, I did want to add, that there is a protective screen on this. Not a screen to peal off, an actual permanent screen protector. I was trying to get it off when I stopped to look it up because it was stuck on there so good. Do not remove this, but feel free to add your own protector on top.

Beautiful hardware, worth the premium
Reviewed in Canada on May 5, 2023Edition: OLED Console Zelda Special EditionVerified Purchase
This Zelda-themed console made a striking impact immediately out of the box. This is my first Switch, and I’m so happy I decided to buy this limited edition version. The only minor quibble I have is that the pack-in controller mount for the JoyCons isn’t decorated in any way. But I guess they wanted to make sales of the themed Pro controller (which was very quickly sold out).It would also be nice if they could include a digital copy of the game for the price, but I realize Nintendo doesn’t like to take losses on their consoles, so it’d be impossible to include the game at this cost.Very happily enjoying playing my Switch meanwhile, and looking forward to the release of Tears of the Kingdom soon!

Reviewed in Canada on April 30, 2023Edition: OLED Console Zelda Special EditionVerified Purchase
The Re-design for the OLED switch is quite nice. Coming from a first gen Switch to this is a nice little upgrade the kick stand is much more robust. The MicroSD port is in a much less awkward place. The back plate is now metal which is nice since it gives a good amount of weight to the overall system and feels good in the hands (I mostly play it in handheld mode) the joy-cons do not seem redesigned though so watch out for the same problems that plague the joy-cons.The dock was also redesigned. No longer is the back door hinged, but comes off entirely making it less awkward for plugging in the cables.The Ethernet port works perfectlyOverall the presentation is quite nice, as much as I wish that it was a bundle with the game, the amount of detail on this specific switch is really nice. They definitely took their time designing the artwork for both the console and the dock.

Reviewed in Canada on April 30, 2023Edition: OLED Console Zelda Special EditionVerified Purchase
I love this Switch Oled. Pictures cannot do it justice as it looks even better in person. So if you think it looks good right now with all the pictures you see of it or even videos online, then you will LOVE it in person. Plays amazingly as a Switch Oled should, the image quality on that thing is a chef's kiss. I was prepared for this console, I got a nice 512GB SD card, a tempered glass screen protector, a dockable plastic shell for the switch itself and joycons to protect it all from my greasy hands, and finally a dust cover (transparent so as to not hide the beautiful art but also protect it for the evil dust bunnies. The actual box itself looks amazing so if you're a collector or someone who likes to display this stuff, it's a great addition.Overall, I am a very satisfied client!

The Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) is a significant upgrade in the smart display category, blending the convenience of Alexa with enhanced multimedia capabilities. Here's a succinct review of its key features and performance:Design and Display: The Echo Show 8 maintains its compact, user-friendly design, making it a perfect fit for any room. The 8-inch HD screen offers crisp, vibrant visuals, making it ideal for video calls, streaming content, and browsing photos.Camera Upgrade: One of the standout upgrades is the 13 MP camera, which significantly improves video call quality. With auto-framing, the camera keeps you centered during calls, enhancing the overall experience when connecting with friends and family.Alexa Integration: Alexa's integration remains top-notch, allowing users to control smart home devices, ask for news updates, set reminders, and much more, all through voice commands. The responsiveness and accuracy of voice recognition have seen noticeable improvements.Sound Quality: The audio performance of the Echo Show 8 is impressive for its size, delivering clear, robust sound. Whether listening to music, podcasts, or during calls, the sound quality enriches the user experience.Privacy Features: Amazon has paid attention to privacy concerns, equipping the Echo Show 8 with physical shutters for the camera and a microphone mute button. These features provide peace of mind for users cautious about their privacy.Overall Experience: The Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen) is a well-rounded smart display that excels in connectivity, entertainment, and smart home management. Its upgraded camera, combined with the reliable performance of Alexa, makes it a compelling choice for anyone looking to enhance their smart home ecosystem.Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars. The Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen) misses a perfect score narrowly due to its relatively unchanged design and the ever-present competition for more integrations. However, for those invested in the Alexa ecosystem, it's an excellent addition, offering a blend of practicality, entertainment, and smart home functionality.

We have an ‘Echo Show 5’ which we like, except for the smaller 5” screen size. The EchoShow8 with its bigger screen, better audio and ‘Hub’ features ( controlling other ‘Alexa ’programmed units) is much better than the 5 unit. It has many features that we are still exploring how to use. One negative feature is the initial cost. As such, just wait till it goes on sale. We have no regrets purchasing it.

My son introduced me to these wipes, as he was given a sample from the company he used to work for. I like that there are no perfumes or added chemicals that my dog would be licking off his paws when I clean them with the wipes. They are great for my whole family who have sensitive skin and don't like any perfumes or chemicals. The wipes have'nt dried out before the package is finished and are sturdy yet soft enough for all cleaning uses. They are a bit pricey but I haven't found any cheaper alternatives.

These are the purest wipes I was able to find. We used to use the Kirkland brand but realized that she would stop us from wiping her because it was hurting. There must be some kind of chemical in the Kirkland wipes that isn't good for her little parts. We haven't had that problem ever since we switched. Thank you for creating something simple and pure. Why do other brands put many chemicals in wipes that are meant for newborns and toddlers?

Different wipes than before
Reviewed in Canada on September 23, 2022Size: 60 count (Pack of 12)Verified Purchase
I have ordered these wipes for the last two years and they have always worked fantastic for us. These were the only wipes we could use and I was happy to pay more of a premium price since they worked so well.The “new look” wipes arrived to my house a couple days ago and I opened my first package today. They are NOT the same. The ingredients are listed as the same however, somehow the instructions to “use the package within 4 weeks” has changed to 2 weeks (pictures above). Why would this be if the ingredients are the same? The new ones smell is awful. The old wipes smelled like nothing, they are supposed to be 99.9% water. The new wipes smell of chemicals, even though there are supposed to be none in them. And finally, the quality of these “new look” wipes are much worse. They are flimsy and cheap feeling and don’t feel as “wet” as the old ones do.Thankfully, I have a couple packs of the old wipes that I will be using until I can find another alternative as these are now useless and for this price I wouldn’t recommend this as a pure water wipe.

Greatest healing product i've ever seen
Reviewed in Canada on May 23, 2016Verified Purchase
Wow, just wow. I didn't even knew that such a product could exists. The health benefits are crazy good.I bought the DE because i had worms. Lotsa worms and before going to the doctor i thought, hey lets go check online if there is something useful against worms. My first search in google got me this magical powder. Read a bit about it then i came to amazon to buy it.Mind you, i've been using it for only 1 week at 2 tea spoon a day. Here are the results i got:- The worms are getting killed all right. My 'region where the sun don't shine' has stopped itching almost completely(One of the worm sign). My mind is clearer, i have less fatigue and i can sleep a whole lot better at night. I get uninterrupted sleep, something i had not seen in years! I also seem to have lost my stomach ulcers. Before, when i woke up, i could not lazy long in bed because i got stomach pain, but now i somehow can lazy around all morning with no problems! DE make me lazy!!! ;-)- I'm a guy with a oily head. Always had that problem as long as i can remember. And of course, it itch all the time. Well after one week, bye bye oily head! Now it itch almost never and my hair have grown back or they became much thicker than before. After all the hair regrowth treatments and anti-itching skull products i've tried over the year who got me nothing, 1 week of DE get me results that must be seen to be believed. It's THAT good. And my hair somehow stay shiny. Even after 2 days without showering, they still look good.- My skin somehow looks better, especially in my face (But then, it's the part you watch the most). I wish i had known DE when i was 15 and full of pimples, it could have helped quite a bit with my greasy skin.- I have an acoufen (constant ringing in the ear) for years. Now it's almost gone. I can barely hear it anymore. I can't believe it how great it is to not hear that crap all day long!About the product itself:- I'm in canada and i bought on monday, they shipped on wednesday and i got it on friday. With the 'free shipping'. Very fast shipping.- The image of this product doesn't do it justice. You see a little bag and you say to yourself, bah 10 pounds is not a big bag. How very mistaken you are my padawan! This product is the same consistency as floor, so it is very very light. 10 pounds bag is a biiiig bag. Imagine a 10 pounds floor bag and you will be close to it.- The price is fantastic. I've checked a bit and for that much of the product, you pay very little.- The quality is godly. From the results i got in only 1 week? Yeah thats fantastic quality right there.- The product is non-toxic for humans (including children, babies even), pets, dolphins, elephants. But it kill all sorts of bugs plenty fast.

Miraculous!
Reviewed in Canada on January 28, 2017Verified Purchase
What this stuff does is nothing short of miraculous! This got me totally off of heart medication after the side effects of the medicines I was taking left me feeling weak and nearly dead every day. My wife started using it, and her blood pressure started going down within a couple months, and her doctor has reduced her medication dramatically. I had an issue with ED and NO LONGER! I never used medication for that, and it surprised me! I did not expect that side effect!Our hair grows faster, as do our nails. I heal much faster from cuts and scrapes. My movements are more regular. Heck, I even treated my cat with this for worms! Just mixed it with canned cat food and dry cat food, he loved it! No more worms after just a week's feedings!We use a cheaper DE (farm animal food grade) for the garden... kills all the critters, and no poisons needed!If you haven't tried this product, you really should, no matter how healthy you are. I just take two tablespoons and place it into a glass of water, let it dissolve before stirring it, and toss it down before it settles again. This brought me back to life, I'll tell ya. Looking back at my pictures while I was on heart medication... scary! I looked like I had one foot in the grave! To see me now, you would never believe I ever had a heart attack and two stints. I haven't even had to use Nitro after taking this for just a couple of months, and I use to have terrible angina.I started a friend of mine on it who had stage 4 Chrones, and within 2 weeks he said he was not even having any more symptoms of Chrones!I am not a doctor, and am not prescribing anything, just giving my testimony is all. Going off of any medication without consulting your own doctor could be dangerous, I know that. I, myself, was in the hospital every month for months after my heart attack with multiple angioplasties, and two separate stints on two different occasions. I always felt tired and weak, and nearly dead.  I was desperate, so I researched this, and it worked for me. I recommend you take a look at some videos of this on Youtube and see what others are saying about it.

Dealt with my creepy crawling buddies
Reviewed in Canada on August 17, 2020Verified Purchase
We recently moved from the city to the country, to a home that had undergone renovations. I hadn't anticipated the amount of insects that had moved into the house along with us. I was looking for a natural solution to help mitigate all of the Asian lady beetles, ants, ear wigs, ticks and spiders, etc. inside the house. My dear mother suggested trying diatomaceous earth, so I purchased this bag (best value for the quantity - skip big box retailers all together because their prices just do not compare).I am so very happy with this product. I put it in a squeeze bottle with a narrow tip and squeezed sparingly wherever I saw bugs (corners of rooms, along windowsills, on the deck, at the thresholds of doors). After a few days, any insects I saw near the area I applied were gone. Worked especially well with earwigs and silverfish. I simply reapply as needed. Others mentioned to be careful with the use of diatomaceous earth and vacuum cleaners. I have a bagless vacuum cleaner (Dyson) and it seems to do okay with picking up any residual diatomaceous earth dust on the floors, which is handy.I have yet to try this product internally but since it is a ten pound bag, that will likely last me years and years, I imagine that I will eventually!

I've had one of these before and it was a pretty decent doorbell camera. Picture is pretty good, night vision good, motion detection was good. Bought this one to replace my old camera and although it was easy to install, it would lose video whenever the doorbell button was pressed, and often would not ring the indoor chime. Probably something wrong with this particular unit but wasn't offered a replacement to try, just a refund. As Nest is no longer in business (consumed by Google), it's probably time to move on to a different brand.

I wanted an assassins creed set in Japan, but this game delivered that for me. First of all, what a gorgeous game and what a beautiful world. I was distracted by my surroundings most of the time. I usually skip some cinematics, but this game makes you watch them - I got used to this and it immersed me more in the story, and I got very attached to my character and my horse. This game made me feel real feelings much like Red Dead Redemption 2. I didn’t know I could write such a beautiful haiku. The set up of the world borrows much from the Assassins’ Creed franchise - an open world full of markers for you to explore. Some of the side things you have to do feel repetitive. Some of the houses I wandered through were too similar. They should have made unique items like Skyrim, instead of terming everything as just “supplies”. More random events would have been nice. Regardless, the quests are rich and rewarding and the fights are very fun. I very much enjoyed this beautiful game and i highly recommend it.

My Favorite PS4 Title
Reviewed in Canada on February 14, 2021Verified Purchase
Ghost of Tsushima is an excellent stealth/action game with lots of beautiful scenery and locations to explore. No other open world game motivated me as much to take in the environment and wander off the beaten path. Ghost of Tsushima really does feel something like a cross between reality and a dream world.Stealth is satisfying and rewarding (especially when paird with a bow) and combat is challenging without being frustrating. The different combat stances you can dynamically switch between add a layer of depth and stratagy to your fights that never gets old.The story and writing are decent, though probably not the highlight of the game.Overall I think this is a must play for any PS4 owner.

Rich story, amazing graphics, and now that I've finished it, I can tell you there's replay value. I'd say above all is the lack of bugs in a few this big. I encountered one big, and it wasn't game breaking at all.Game does have some repetition, but that's to be expected in an open world.This game is solid, I can't recommend it enough.

Awesome game.  Even more awesome on the PS5
Reviewed in Canada on January 12, 2021Verified Purchase
Just need an HD textures patch on the PS5 and this would be perfect (and maybe some select raytracing effects too).  Really enjoyed this game and close to getting a platinum.  Played first on PS4 Pro then swapped over to PS5.  Other than some slightly better loading times and more consistent performance, it's the same awesome game.  It did not feel like a slog to me to keep defeating the mongols and getting more abilities.  Music and art direction are top notch.  Game of the year for me for 2020.

Blown Away by Sony VR2 with Gran Turismo. Insane.
Reviewed in Canada on December 31, 2023Edition: PS VR2 HeadsetVerified Purchase
I am not your normal reviewer of video games - as I am not young. I have friends who enjoy sims and have dabbled with the idea, but after watching Ford VS Ferrari .. others ... then Gran Turismo I was intrigued by the PS5, and researched VR. After reading the Car and Driver article ""We Review Sony's PS VR2 Headset That Turns the Couch into a Race Cockpit"" I decided to jump in.The whole VR landscape is rather ""muted"" as the games are not that great. But Gran Turismo with VR is mind boggling. It is the perfect game.You feel like you are in the car - hence those who get motion sickness should not buy it. It is 1) simple to use 2) insanely effective versus going ""hardcore"" with a PC. It gets set up in moments and just works (I do not want to be tweaking). 3) Multiplayer is incredibleBlown. Away. Add a force feedback wheel and pedals and it is the perfect gaming scenario.The perfect application of VR - in a simple to use package.

Mind blowing gaming experience with Gran Turismo 7
Reviewed in Canada on November 6, 2023Edition: PS VR2 HeadsetVerified Purchase
This piece of kit elevate a great racing game into a memorable racing experience where you can see and drive the meticulously detailed cars in this game.(I cannot separate PSVR2 from Gran Turismo 7 as this is the only thing I use it for, but for that alone it is 100% worth it.)It was very easy to setup, works as expected and is comfortable with glasses, and the resolution and frame rate is crisp and smooth enough to make it feel very convincing. I did get some VR inserts to avoid scratching my lenses or the VR ones, but it's not essential at all. The headphones it comes with are also decent enough, and being in a sonic space adds so much to the experience too - so if you can add some of your own with noise cancelling, it adds even more to the immersion.I did find some nausea when jumping into the first couple of drives, and had to take it slowly to get used to it and within a day or two I was racing full races with no issue. Your mileage may vary obviously, so I recommend trying one first, in an environment where you can relax and take it slowly, to see if it's for you.

The only downside about the PSVR 2 is — compared to the PSVR 1 — audio only comes from the earphones, and not from the TV, so I recommend buying this with some sort of Bluetooth audio adapter..Overall, it’s amazing! And it’s so crazy that it can actually track the movement of your eyes! Sony wasn’t kidding when they mentioned that! I also love how the actual VR headset vibrates, and not just the controllers!Shipping and handling was 10/10. I got my PSVR 2 in pristine condition! Brand new!

PSVR 2 - Huge Disappointment
Reviewed in Canada on May 10, 2023Edition: PS VR2 HeadsetVerified Purchase
I have the PSVR 1. Purchased it 6 months ago at a good price. Seems to work well but as a first gen PSVR, the graphics is not great but still fun with a few games to play. For the price of the PSVR 2, you would expect a significant upgrade. I purchased the PSVR 2 mainly for Gran Turismo 7 as GT 7 is an amazing game. After trying it out and making a ton of adjustments to make it work, the PSVR 2 is only slightly, marginally better in resolution and graphics. This is very disappointing for what they charge for it, the price of which exceeds the actual PlayStation 5 console! Image is simply burry and not clear.  I would not recommend the PSVR 2 even for diehards!

Reviewed in Canada on March 7, 2023Edition: PS VR2 HeadsetVerified Purchase
I was a big fan of the first PSVR. There were a lot of awesome VR experiences that I enjoyed. However with the PSVR2, I don't see any new VR experiences for it. There are a few games, which I guess is the main purpose of this. I was kinda hoping for more. As far as the unit itself, it's good, Light does not get into where your eyes are, the lens for me does not seem to fog. I'm a little disappointed that I can't use the playstation headset with the PSVR2. You will have to use wired ear buds. It comes with one, so that is good. The image is really bright and sharp when watching a 4k youtube video. I played a PS5 game on it, it looked.. ok. It does not nearly look as good if I was just playing it normal on my 4K TV. If I don't plug a headset/earbuds to the PSVR2, you get no sound. While the original will then default to your normal sound setup, aka your TV, or a sound system. The follow up is suppose to build upon and improve from the original. It does in some ways, which I mentioned above, but fails in others. I really wanted to like it.. but I can't help but feel the original was a better experience. It's so expensive, I should return it, but I'm hoping it gets better..

Decided to pick it up for my brother as a Christmas present so our family could play it. Looking forward to all the laughs.Mouth pieces are a little large. I have a small mouth and it kept popping out while I was trying to talk. Only suggestion would be to only have the mouthpiece in when it’s your turn, and if your mouth runs small like mine, hold on to it lol.

This game will honestly have you laughing from beginning to end. I played this about 10-12 times with friends and family and its been nothing but enjoyable. I would say buying expansion packs for this game is a must because after playing it for awhile you end up getting familiar with the cards so its less of a challenge. I found the mouth pieces were a little difficult at first to put around my mouth but it got easier as we played. Its not conformable if you're wondering but it definitely is hilarious.

This is my first color Tamagotchi so I can’t compare it to the others (i.e., On/Meets, Smart, etc.). Unlike many other reviewers here, I personally like the touch buttons. There are a lot more things you can do on this device compared to the old Tmgc from the 90’s. I find that my character isn’t very needy which is great because I can leave it alone for hours while I’m working and not worry about it dying. The battery life isn’t great (as others have mentioned); the device lasts for about 5 days on my chargeable AAAs. I bought this when the price dropped to $66 (CAD), but have seen it at stores for $90. Pretty surprised by the price tag considering this is supposed to be a kid’s toy. For this price, they could at least give you a pair of batteries.

I find that my character isn’t very needy which is great because I can leave it alone for hours while I’m working and not worry about it dying. The battery life isn’t great (as others have mentioned); the device lasts for about 5 days on my chargeable AAAs. I bought this when the price dropped to $66 (CAD), but have seen it at stores for $90. Pretty surprised by the price tag considering this is supposed to be a kid’s toy. For this price, they could at least give you a pair of batteries.

Keep the regular buttons PLEASE
Reviewed in Canada on March 2, 2022Verified Purchase
It's definitely not my favourite tama version.Pros / likes - I like that the games change every day and there is a lot of options do to with your tama. I'm only on my 1st gen so I'm sure there's a lot more interactive stuff I'm in store for.Cons / dislikes - the touch buttons are awful. Awful. Awful. Press A action B happens etc. It's really frustrating. Cool idea but awful execution. Trying to press all three buttons at the same time to get the bathroom action to happen has yet to work for me - always goes to clock.The camera idea is really not fun. Obviously catered towards children but I just think the whole idea does not need to be there.

(box the product came in not pictured!!)Does not come with batteries, and will require a small screwdriver to open.Compared to the Tamagotchi On, there are less features! But this is okay. Tamagotchi Pix has features more comparable to that of the original Tamagotchi.Once you understand the controls it becomes extremely easy to move through.I am loving this, it thrills me to check in every so often. I highly reccomend.

The Pro-Controller is one thing and one thing only, a great controller
Reviewed in Canada on May 9, 2019Verified Purchase
I needed another set of controllers for the Nintendo switch and I was back and forth on which ones to choose. Should I get another set of Joy-Cons or the Pro Controller? The Joy-Con controllers are pretty amazing, use them as 1 unit, or separate them out. Track motion with them or connect them directly to the switch. What the Joy-Con controllers are capable of is impressive, but this multi-functionality comes at a cost. They aren't the most precise controllers nor the most comfortable, and once I used the Pro-Controller this became even more obvious.  The Pro-Controller is one thing and one thing only, a great controller. The buttons and sticks are more precise and give you much more control over the game. The grip is better and more comfortable and the layout is simply more intuitive. Playing some games almost felt like an entirely new experience as the added precision from the Pro-Controller made accomplishing some feats much easier than they ever were with the Joy-Con's. If you plan on any serious gaming I feel the Pro Controllers are a must. The Joy-Cons are serviceable and fine for some games, but the added control from the Pro Controller is worth it.Pro's:• Much more precision and control with the Pro Controller over the Joy-Cons• 40 hour battery life vs the joy cons 6• Much more comfortable in the hand than the Joy-Cons• Can be played while wired to the Switch Consol• Slightly cheaper than the Joy-ConsCon's:• The Joy cons are essentially two controllers, where the Pro Controller is only one• Heavier than the Joy-Cons. However, I felt this added weight actually helped with the comfort• No motion tracking or other functionality that the Joy-Cons haveThoughts:I would say unless you need 2 more controllers, or are replacing the Joy-Cons, go with the Pro Controller. Head to head in some games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the player using the Pro Controller would have an advantage over the one using the Joy-Cons. The Pro is much more precise, comfortable and easier to use.

Switch OEM controller
Reviewed in Canada on April 1, 2024Verified Purchase
I bought all kinds of controllers for my switch, including the JoyCon ones (which always seem to drift after a while) and a non-nintendo one.  Sorry to say, the only one I've been 100% happy with is this one.  It works. The battery lasts for hours.Sadly I guess I wasted money on the cheaper knockoff version, and even on the OEM JoyCon ones.

This is An Absolute Must for your Gaming Experience......
Reviewed in Canada on December 3, 2018Verified Purchase
This is a great addition to include with your Nintendo Switch Console.  The Joy Cons and the Grip that is included with the Switch Console provide a suitable alternate to merge both Controllers together. However for any Gamer, especially an entry level or Hard Core Gamer, this is the Controller you need.  It is slightly bigger than the Controllers for other Game Brands but the feel, look and comfort is next to none.  I found it easier when playing either Mario Kart Deluxe and Lego Marvel Superheroes. This is not to imply the Joy Cons are not suitable for the Switch, they are great because there are Games that are designed specifically to use the Joy Cons either individually or collectively.  Again, the positives about this Controllers, and with the Joy Cons, it's quite versatile and anyone can use them.This Pro Controller is Wireless and includes a USB Cable to allow you to charge the device when required.  You can definitely play and charge the Controller at the same time however the cord is not significantly long enough; which would require you to sit closer to the Dock and TV screen.  Pairing the Controller is automatic and you choose directly from the On Screen Menu which Controller you wish to use.  The amazing part, you can swap between Controller and Joy Cons at any point during your Game.  This is a fantastic feature with the Nintendo Switch Console as well as the simplicity to toggle between Controllers.As described, the battery life is for approximately 40 hours and it is recommended to charge this Controller prior to using it for the first time. I'm in the habit of always charging my Controller as soon as I shut down my Switch.  This is no different when charging a Tablet or Smartphone; to keep is charged at all times.There was no lapse or delay when using this Controller in full game action.  The buttons and layout is beautifully arranged for the Player; I really applaud Nintendo because the buttons are raised and easy to press and maneuver.  Once I took it out from the box and held it; I automatically became accustomed to the feel and look of the Controller.  In addition, I was able to fully recognize the button configuration without having to look down after a very short period of time.Again, for any entry level or Hard Core Gamer; this is a definite must, you need for your Nintendo Switch. It will solidify your Gaming experience and make it more enjoyable.

No more constipation!
Reviewed in Canada on November 28, 2021Verified Purchase
We had been using powdered enfamil and similac and were getting 2-3 days in between dirty diapers. While we'd heard this isn't abnormal, I was a bit uncomfortable with the lack of regularity and worried about painful gas.Once we got going into the Nestle Good Start, we've started getting one dirty diaper every day (with, as another reviewer mentioned very green baby poop).She seems to like the flavour well enough (better than the metallic-tasting Enfamil), and the scoop can sit inside the lid on the rim of the container (just balance it across the opening, pushed off to one side), which I find much more sanitary than having to dig it out of the powder with other brands!At the end of the day the main reason I chose it is the following: Unlike a lot of the other major brands out there, it has whey protein, hydrolyzed from milk, as its first ingredient. Many of the other brands have either a corn syrup solid or some kind of other plant-based protein as the first ingredient.It's also purported to have less sugar in it. I call that a win.

That may explain why the Canadian brands of Tongkat Ali always have such a low dosage of Tongkat Ali. This product did produce an increase of testosterone. I know that because of how I felt physically.  But it was the same low feeling I got with an Ashwaghanda product i.e. I was expecting more. This may be a result of the low dosage. I did finish this bottle.I then switched to another, American brand with more Tongkat Ali, and the difference is noticeable. The American brand produced more T at roughly the same price.So, to summarise, I was disappointed with this Canadian product.

I refuse to pay $23ish dollars(Nov, 23-$48.00)for two bars of soap. When I last purchased them in July 2021 I paid $2.47 for the same two bars.It is a sad day for me because I did like this soap.

Bonjour,  First, I have to give 5 stars to the seller for quick delivery !Now,  I know this product from using for over 30 years, it is absolutely EXCELLENT, every household should have those bars soap.That being said, It is impossible to find them in store, at the moment. Usually the price for 2 bars (which is one package, as seen on the picture) is about +/- 3.00$ at Wal Mart.  This seller OVER PRICED it, knowing that people who knows the product will want it.  However, I find it quite sad that sellers act like this, quite sad.  It shows a low sense of integrity and/or value.

Reviewed in Canada on February 18, 2023Verified Purchase
This soap is perfect for whitening items that cannot be bleached. I've had items that were yellowed with age but could not be bleached without ruining part of the garment. I'd lather it up and let it hang in the sun like that.  Rinse, lather repeat a few times with particularly yellowed fabric.  Item is now perfectly white, very little fading of anything that isn't white and it smells clean, fresh and new.It's sad that right now for 2 bars of soap they are asking $44. YES FOURTY-FOUR dollars for 2 bars of soap.My more common is is to lather and let it soak like that for a few hours in a bucket before throwing the item in the washing machine with the rest of the clothes . Most stains and heavy duty dirt will be gone.I don't use it every day but when I use it the results are excellent.

Good product does effective job.
Reviewed in Canada on July 6, 2021Verified Purchase
I have been using Sunlight soap for years! My mother used it and she thought it was a good product. It is a good soap to use for housecleaning and for laundering. I use it with baking soda to remove greasy or oily stains on clothes, it is quite effective!  I use first the sunlight soap on the stain  massaging it in, not rubbing  and then add the baking soda using  a soft small brush and working it in small circular motions on the stain. I do both sides of the garment, the top part and inside. Then wash it in lukewarm water and rinse in cold. If it is a stubbing stain, I let it dry (air dry) no dryer, the heat will set the stain. Usually the stain comes out on the first try. Sunlight soap is a good product, it has been around a long time. It has a nice lemon sent and the value for money is good. I will continue to buy Sunlight soap. A loyal customer, I am.

WORKS!
Reviewed in Canada on June 21, 2021Verified Purchase
I use this for stain removal and it works great.  I add a bit of water to the stain, rub this on and scrub the spot a few moments with the rough edge of a quarter and it takes out almost anything!  I wouldn't use it on jeans or something else with a dye that you're concerned about, as it can take the colour out if  you're aggressively scrubbing like I do - it's that powerful.  I do suspect they'd be great for travel, though, if you're just using for light use on most fabrics.  Do test it first though on a spot of the fabric that isn't noticeable.For our use, I've been using the same bar for over 10 years!  So for the price, buy 4 bars and give the extras to your kids or folks or someone!  I just bought these for my daughter who is going to live off-grid.  I know she's going to get a lot of use out of them.

Public phone suspended my old phone no till I pay for this month!!!!!! Hopefully public phone will allow me to transfer my old no and replace my old number with chatr's temporary phone no!

Topped off 4 days ago and still got message saying my account is just about to get deactivated for non-payment.  To Avoid this, I need to top off immediately but my account is valid for 25 more days.  So Is this someone phishing or Chatr Has IQ issues?  Oh yeah, they make it tedious to check how much data you used so you won't see how much data you overpaid for.Update -  I can confirm the aforementioned text I received from Chatr was indeed a phishing expedition.  How do I know this?  They did it again, but this time they added a twist.  After paying for another month followed by getting the unscrupulous text stating the payment was still outstanding, my account was locked after placing an order with Skip the Dishes for my elderly mom where MasterCard texts you a confirmation number you need to enter to place the order.  When it didn't come through, I checked the status of my Chatr account to learn it was not active.  It came back online only after paying the monthly fee a second.  I'm going to provide MasterCard with the phishing text messages and have them tear Chatr a new one.One final note - go to Chatr's contact us page and ask yourself why they require your date of birth if you want to send them a message.  Chatr is crooked as they come.

I was loving the gun in the beginning. I purchased this item to use for dog training and was quite careful with this gun. The dogs were never shot up close, but it was used to tag them when they would bark at the edge of the yard about 30' away. This totally worked and was awesome.What isn't awesome. The Sprya2 stopped being able to shoot water at all about 5 months in. It still attempts to suck water in, but seems to suck it in into an infinite loop such that the water starts to just come out of the side of the gunI tried a couple suggestions that was on the Sprya2 website without any success in getting the gun able to fire water again. By the time I paid for shipping and border fees this water gun was $300 or so. I attempted to contact anyone at Sprya but they do not have a specific contact for any issues or support that I can see, only order tracking. If you don't mind paying $300 ish after all is said and done to have a water gun that lasts a handful of months, then this gun is for you.

Reviewed in Canada on May 14, 2018Verified Purchase
Love the system. It’s too bad that most people don’t know about it and it hasn’t sold well. The Switch is still superior but for a 4-year-old device, it’s up there. If they ever make a Switch Mini, this is the perfect size. It’s got a library of great PSP games for sale on the store, plus all the good Vita games. Quite a few good PS4 games started their lives on the Vita, like Gravity Rush, Persona 4 Dancing All Night, Severed, Toukiden, etc.If you like games from Japan, you’ll have a blast here. It’s comfortable to hold and play with on long hours. Great battery life, in the range of 5-10 hours instead of 2-5 for Switch. I have both and I would say that the Switch is the hybrid console and the Vita a true portable console, in line with the 3DS but just way better graphics and resolution.

            I was unsure due to the sketchy listing title and lack of information. But I can say I did get a PS Vita Slim in Mint condition; I see some reviewers got damaged/scratched units... I guess I was lucky? Battery was DOA but after charging for an hour it booted up and continued to charge to full during the Mod. I am SUPER Happy with this and cannot express how much this is my Favorite Gaming Unit!

Vita slim is a great revision, fantastic handheld.
Reviewed in Canada on September 4, 2016Verified Purchase
The Vita slim fixes all of my issues from the original model, definitely glad I gave it another chance!  Controls are much easier to use with the smaller rear touchpad, the battery life is excellent, and aside from the price and availability of memory cards, I have no complaints at all.It's a shame this system didn't catch on, if the slim version launched first I feel it really would've helped.  The OLED screen is the only perk on the original model, but without having them side by side you'd honestly never know, because the slim's screen still looks great.

Ps vita it is a great handheld console
Reviewed in Canada on February 22, 2016Verified Purchase
Ps vita it is a great handheld console. Graphics are great specially if you play ps now. I returned it because I have bell internet and the service is everything but reliable or stable so when I was playing on ps now the games would get a bit laggy. I bought it in first instance to do remote play so it didn't work for me. The only thing is that games are a bit pricey.

Reviewed in Canada on March 14, 2024Size: 2 packPattern Name: Flea ProtectionVerified Purchase
This is a good product, especially if your cat is really infested with fleas.  However, when it says only 99% effective, they are correct.  And if just one flea remains that can produce eggs, you start all over again.  We used this product on our two cats for almost 2 years before we clued in that you have to comb the cat to get rid of any fleas that this product does not kill.  In my opinion, that's the only to get rid of fleas in your home and on your cat.  It's a special flea comb for cats and they love getting combed.

I have only used this product about 4 times since I received it on March 11th, 2023. I am a man, 24, and have also struggled with dandruff and dry scalp for over 10 years now.Day 1 (March 13) - Used the product for the first time, only a teaspoon and lathered it in, left it for about 5 minutes and then washed it out. After an hour, when my hair started drying, there was some dandruff in the middle of the scalp. But, there was a HUGE noticeable difference on the sides, and the flaking had reduced quite a lot!Day 2 (March 16) - Was advised to only use it twice a week, so I waited a couple days and in these days, the flaking started to come back because it's been a few days since I had used this shampoo again. After using the same process as Day 1, the flaking had been reduced once again, and my head was not getting itchy after a day or two either, and it didn't leave me head dry right after the shower either!March 19 - Used my other shampoo, instead of this one. Added conditioner after, and the flaking was still quite low, I thought it would resurface when I switched back, glad it didn't!Day 3 (March 21) - Started to use less of the shampoo at this time and was making a huge difference, as my scalp was clearing up and there was no sign of flaking or dandruff, which was already a miracle.Day 4 (March 25) - After this use is when I did not see a single spec of dandruff on my head and even after a couple days, my head is still clear. There is no itching or dryness of the scalp, which I am so thankful for.I would highly recommend this shampoo for people looking to combat their dry scalp, flaking, and dandruff. Like I said previously, I have been struggling with dandruff for over 10 years and have tried quite a few shampoos (natural or company-owned ones) and nothing has worked as remarkably as this one. Whoever came up with the formula for this, I would like to give you a hug because you have eased one of my major insecurities.EDIT (May 16th, 2023): Still going strong using the same bottle I purchased in March (sometimes once a week, sometimes twice a week) and haven't seen a spec of dandruff since. My head used to get itchy on the second day before I started using this shampoo and haven't had to scratch my head vigorously for a few months now. Will definitely be buying again when it runs out!!

I usually use coal tar which works for me but I ran out and decided to try this based on all the great reviews. It says to use it 2x per week for 2-4 weeks then 1 x per week to maintain thereafter. I went with 4 weeks at 2 x per week. Here’s what each of those weeks were like for me. I massage it in with a silicone scalp massager and let it sit for about 4 minutes before rinsing if that matters.Week 1: unlike coal tar which I find softens the scale, this hardens it. My scalp felt tight and dry which was okay for the first wash but the second one was less pleasant. All the hardened scale started to flake off so I actually worked to brush my scalp and remove it but that was just making it raw and sore so I stopped and left it alone. I just had to shake out all the flakes often. My scalp felt very sore.Week 2: this was the worst week. I lost a bunch more hair than usual and the flaking was really bad. I started using my hairline on my forehead as my way of monitoring progress. After all the flaking at my temple in week 1, I figured it would start to slow down but it did not. I still had a lot of build up almost like it was coming back faster between each wash. At one point at work I brushed my hair between meetings and realized my scalp was bleeding.Week 3: better. I felt like most of the worst parts of my scalp had healed and the hairfall seemed done with. However I still had build up on my scalp and a kind of constant soreness. And a lot of flakes. My temple, which again, I felt should have been done flaking, was still going strong. Mind you, my scalp never flakes. I have a lot of build up / scale but it tends to be oily not flaky. Not so now.Week 4; that’s this week and honestly, I just have a really dry and sore scalp with lots of flaking after each wash. I don’t see it getting better. The same spot on my temple is STILL flaking. So is the rest of my head, but that’s my test case and it was far from the “worst” spot on my scalp prior to treatment. I’m just really surprised that every single day the same spot continues to have new flakes.Verdict: it’s not for me. I really gave this a proper go because I wanted a more permanent solution to my scalp issues. I don’t think this is doing what I need it to do. I have way more dandruff while using it than I ever did without it. Coal tar fully clears it up for me for three weeks with a single use so I’ll go back to that. It’s possible that I don’t have the same issue as others (I was only diagnosed with “scalp dermatitis” which they told me means they don’t know what’s up). So maybe this fungus approach just wasn’t the right one for me.

It's a point and shoot with some SLR features.
Reviewed in Canada on July 16, 2019Colour Name: BlackStyle: BasePattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
This is my first TG-series camera. I am coming from a DSLR, which doesn't play nice with my kayak on a number of levels. I bought this camera as a go-anywhere-do-anything camera, and to my surprise this is exactly what it is. It gives me some of the features of my DSLR, which is nice, but I kept running into the limits of the hardware. Still, most of the time I was able to get what I want.I was able to get some nice bokeh, though I wouldn't want to use this for portraits. Maybe with the teleconverter it would become a passable portrait camera, I don't know. I used it for landscapes, lots of landscapes, and it worked pretty well for that. I see some color bleeding and some vignette, but I wouldn't call those problematic. The lens is the equivalent of a standard zoom, so no bird-watching with this thing, and I doubt the teleconverter can do a whole lot to change that. I had a chance to play with the fisheye adapter for about an hour and it gave me just a slightly wider angle overall, but nothing I would call a must-have. This camera is amazing for macro photography, though: my few attempts at it all turned out stunning.Hardware is pretty sturdy, though the screen at the back scratches easily. GET A PROTECTOR! I am not particularly worried about the lack of an EVF as I wear glasses, though I seem to be alone to not consider this a problem. The screen is somewhat hard to see in bright sunlight, but I am able to manage. The camera survived salt water, sand, being tossed unprotected in my luggage, even being in my PFD while I kayak and perform stunts. I am quite pleased! It's the right tool for the job and it worked pretty well! The camera is small, the controls are sometimes hard to operate with gloves, but I don't see how a compact camera can possibly solve that issue: I guess Olympus can add a touchscreen, but touchscreens don't work well when water is involved.Now for the software. Argh the software!The Olympus RAW format is ORF and is mostly unsupported by anything. There is a plugin for Photoshop (not sure if Lightroom supports it, but I hear no), and that's about it. I got a once-in-a-lifetime offer to get the Adobe software for regular price, and that's the extent of the support I got from Olympus. What if I don't want to use Adobe stuff? There is no indication anywhere in the documentation how exactly I am supposed to integrate Olympus RAW with any photo processing workflow, including Adobe's which they promote so aggressively. Eventually I stumbled upon something called Olympus Workspace, which appears to do something close to what Lightroom does, but I ultimately settled on a third-party tool called Luminar. Luminar worked pretty well.I wish I had more choices! It's a shame a camera so well regarded and so respected (the TG-5 is practically the gold standard for camera for water sports) doesn't do more to be supported by photo-processing software out there.The battery life is on par with my DSLR! I can get several hundred pictures on a single battery charge! I also love the in-camera modes for panorama, HDR and focus-stacking. Neither of them are perfect, of course: the panorama mode is trying to stitch shots by tracking landmarks in your frame, but when it cannot find one right at the edge of the frame (e.g. it encounters the empty horizon), it gets hopelessly lost. Similarly, focus-stacking would sometimes fail for reasons I have not investigated yet.I hope this is helping someone.

I am a avid outdoors person, from hiking and kayaking to relaxing on the beach.  I recently just purchased my 3rd Olympus TG camera.  M6 original one does still take pictures,  the only issue I had was that it came with a flip screen, it's the screen itself that no longer works.  I have left the kids use that camera for years and has been dropped banged around etc and still going (minus the screen) my last one is about 8 years old and has been on many camping trips in the wilderness where it's been dropped on boulders from my life jacket pocket, once it was not locked up and battery cover opened,  landing in the water.  It needed to be dried out for a day sitting in sun, but still worked for years afterwards.  I have bought what I reviews say where better Camra’s but this is truly a great camera for those loving the outdoors.  I have used many times for taking photos under water or while swimming.  The only downside I can see is that the mega pixels are not as good as others but it still takes great quality pictures.

Experienced User Replacing Old Model
Reviewed in Canada on November 24, 2022Colour Name: BlackStyle: BasePattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
It was time to replace my Olympus Tough (8 years of a lot of travel and on land and under water use...1000's of pics).  I like that the flash functions are handier. I love the wifi connection so that I don't have to open the camera as much to transfer pictures. It is a solid camera with more functions than most of us can use. It is point and shoot, to advanced functions.  The box did not include the manual or warranty card, so be sure to register your camera warranty on-line, and download the 160 page manual. Read it, practice. I ordered a lens cap protector...recommended. I recommend a long neck strap so you can hang it on your neck, especially for boating and under-water use. It will sink like a stone if you are not careful, so be careful :)

Good and versatile camera. The ""purple spot"" in images created by earlier models seems to be resolved; different lens coating? What is really, really annoying is the new menu. It is VERY cumbersome to navigate, especially when using it underwater. Menu on previous models was way better and intuitive. It is so bad that , if I had known, I might have seriously considered a different option. I love my TG-4, used TG-5, but the TG-6 is not an improvement.

Reviewed in Canada on November 8, 2022Style: EGG MISTYVerified Purchase
I have a foreskin that is tight, bordering on but not experiencing phimosis. As a result the tip of my penis is extremely sensitive to the point where it's tender to touch. Trying to use other Tenga toys or even Fleshlights with the cap removed results in discomfort. This on the other hand fits perfectly. They can be reused repeatedly if washed, dried, and properly stored.I highly recommend avoiding the ""Shiny"" variant. The numbs on the inside are not comfortable for people like me and contradicts what I like about the toy in the first place. Judging by the fact that it's the cheapest of the available products as of writing, I guess they are struggling to sell the product more than once to anyone.

Don’t buy this version. We have the hatch rest + for our son and love it !This 2nd gen hatch rest is awful. It always glitches, clock sometimes works sometimes doesn’t, you have to crank the volume full to get a decent sleeping sound. And to top it all off it will connect to my wifi but it will not connect to the app no matter what I’ve tried ! So I’m stuck using the pre programmed noise and lights which is awful. The white noise is stuck on a red light and my poor newborn hates it and won’t sleep in her room. But she loves her brothers room that we were able to make more relaxing with different colours and sounds! The programming on this one sucks and I’ve read a lot of reviews online about it as well and people have the same issues. So do yourself a favour and do not buy this version !!!

Works as expected, I found the sound volume levels just fine and didn’t need to crank them to outrageous levels to hear. App is easy enough to program but more steps then the original and if your WiFi goes out or maybe even the power I doubt this this is turning itself on! Overall it’s fine, most of the same sounds as original and you don’t need the subscription to get enough basic features for a sound machine and wake clock. But if you’re comparing to the hatch 2nd gen to original hatch with NO WiFi it’s not as good and am disappointed they discontinued. I used to always recommend hatch to friends but I’m not sure i would anymore. I’m sure you’ll be happy with the product, works as expected with a few technological mishaps along the way but if you’re comparing to the original you may be surprised!

If I can I try to buy all my cables from Cable Matters because they care and it shows.

Work great for dual monitor for macbook
Reviewed in Canada on June 28, 2023Size: 6 ftVerified Purchase
Have a dell thunderbolt for work, that works great with my work laptop and dual monitor. But couldnt to get that working on my macbook pro 2020 intel core. ( macbook mirrored the exact thing in the two monitors, couldnt extend the display). Found a workaround on dell website telling that we need to connect one monitor directly to the thunderbolt usb c slot. So ordered a Display to Usb C but didnt work. Tried again with This cable and it works perfectly, both for my macbook and my dell work laptop.

It simply did not work
Reviewed in Canada on September 26, 2019Size: 6 ftVerified Purchase
I bought a new Apple MacBook Pro laptop (i5 quad core, 16 gb RAM and 1 TB SSD) from the Apple online store.  Ordered this cable at the same time so I could connect to my LG 29 inch monitor that has worked well with my 2013 MB Pro.  No luck, it would not work at all.I decided I would prefer the 15.4 inch MB Pro so I returned the 13 inch and order the 15.4.  Before returning the USB-C to Display Port cable I decided to wait to see if it work with the 15.4 inch MBP.  Received the 15.4 today (8 core i9, 32 gb RAM and 1 TB SSD) and connected this cable - NO LUCK.  Nothing.  So it has to go back.  I was really hoping it would work so i'd have two cables.I took the precaution of ordering a Moshi cable from Apple - a lot more expensive but much higher quality.  It also arrived today.  I connected it and it worked immediately.  So now i have to go through the return effort with Amazon.  Hope that won't be a pain in the ........  well,  neck.

Black series did it again. A beautiful quality helmet for the price. Compared to Black Series Boba Fett helmet though, this one is definitely a bit smaller and tighter around the face, although easier to see out of when walking around. I find the adjusting strap inside to be a bit on the harder side. Wish it had the same easy adjustment wheel on the strap that the Boba Fett helmet comes with. Not sure on this one why Black Series moved away from what was a very easy head size adjustment system in the Boba Fett helmet. Overall though, it looks amazing, is comfortable to wear once adjusted properly, solidly built and easy to see out of when wearing. Four stars for the head adjusment system in this helmet.

Soothing Toy or Entertaining Cuddle Friend
Reviewed in Canada on March 19, 2024Style: Otter - StandardVerified Purchase
At first, my child wasn’t interested in this toy. I tried using it from her being a fee weeks old, and at random throughout the first year. She finally started to enjoy this toy at around 16 months old, and it has become one of her favourite toys. She loves sotting and watching the little belly go up and down, with the sounds of breathing. She is entertained for quite a bit of time every time she plays with it. I would recommend this for parents, and suggest that if you aren’t seeing it helping calm or sooth your baby to sleep, or even as they grow still no interest, it may take time, and they may eventually love it as one of their favourites. Every baby is different, so it’s worth trying!

Better suited for older babies or toddlers
Reviewed in Canada on May 28, 2020Style: Otter - StandardVerified Purchase
I initially bought this for my 4month old son. I found it to be too big and heavy for him. I didn't' find the breathing mechanism helped at all for sleep. I ended up giving it to my 2.5-year-old who LOVED it.What I like about it:-Lighting - the otter emits a very soft, non-blue-light glow which I think is great and does not disrupt sleep.-Battery life - I purchased this 3 months ago and I've had to replace the batteries once, and it is used nightly.-very soft and cute washes well and still looks new.-The older child loves it.Drawbacks:-I agree with previous reviewers that the breathing mechanism is quite loud. I can hear it from across the hallway when my daughter engages the button in the night. She doesn't seem to mind.-While it's cute, I find it too large for younger babies, and even potentially dangerous for them in a crib. It's about the size of a cabbage patch doll.-The settings are on the inside of the otter - so if you need to or want to change volume settings, you have to do so before the baby is in bed, or you might wake up the baby with the strong velcro closure.- I also had a hard time getting the right settings working - it seems to be in demo mode at times...-Small children can open the velcro on the back and pull out the light and breathing mechanism box. My daughter does this in the night sometimes and uses the inside mechanism as a flashlight. It's safe, but still annoying to have her remove it constantly, then ask me to put it back inside.Overall, I think this is better suited to older babies or toddlers. My toddler's sleep has improved generally since this otter was introduced - she likes to take care of the otter and is comforted by the gentle glow and sweet songs.

One of the best games for the 3DS.
Reviewed in Canada on November 14, 2016Verified Purchase
Along with Super Mario 3D Land, this is probably one of the best titles for the 3DS.  My son got a New 3DS and being someone that spent a fair amount of time gaming when I was younger and had all sorts of time on my hands I still try to find time to play games now and then but find it difficult to get into larger scale games but this one has been perfect for me.  The fact that I can just pick up the 3DS during the evenings and get through a ""chunk"" of A Link Between Worlds in a short period and reach a save point and put it down has meant that I've actually been able to enjoy it and keep coming back to it to make progress.I'm probably about half way through the game now and feel like the amount of content in the game, not even counting the optional grinds (finding the Maimai babies?).  It's very much a classic and approachable Zelda title and one that I felt instantly ""at home"" in regardless of the fact that a good portion of the game requires use of the ""becoming two dimensional"" mechanic - which I thought was going to be silly but really adds a thoughtful layer to the exploration and puzzle solving to this game.  Many of the three dimensional Zelda titles, I just couldn't stick with for whatever reason - and while I know titles like Ocarina of Time are highly regarded, for me, A Link Between Worlds is the perfect Zelda and I personally hope that they make more just like it.While save points are relatively plentiful and you do come across them often enough to avoid becoming too annoyed, I still would have preferred a quick save option so I could literally drop it on a whim, sometimes when you're in the middle of a dungeon you just have to trudge through it to avoid losing your progress (unless you are willing to just suspend the game until next time, not something that works well when you know your kid is going to want to pick it up and play something else).The game is also, arguably, too easy.  I have never actually died yet, and very infrequently had to rely on health restoring items.  In a sense the forgiving nature of making mistakes does help you just enjoy the other non combat options of the game without getting worked up about re-doing anything over and over (oh long gone are the days when I would be willing to play a game on maximum difficulty and re-do each section two dozen times).  Fall off a cliff?  You lose a measly half a heart for that mistake.  While there are some enemies that will take a sizable chunk out of your life if you run afoul of them, they are few and far between so far and in general very easy to avoid and none of the enemies do anything particularly intelligent.All in all, it is games like this that validate the continued existence of the 3DS and I would buy it again and would have still been happy if I had paid the full original MSRP for it.

Reviewed in Canada on December 19, 2013Verified Purchase
This game is awesome. I am on the second time around. I found it harder to get to the boss in the dungeons than killing the boss at the end. There are so many different things to do in this game. The storyline is excellent. You must do challenges to obtain hearts. I did not do two of them. The race and the chicken challenge. Therefore I only ended up with 19 full hearts. You can finish the game with only 19, so no problem. Buy this game. It also is a long game. It took me a week to play it. I played it a 3 or 4 hours every afternoon. This may sound funny, but I enjoyed this game more than any other Zelda game. At first the Windwaker was the best, but this game tops the heap.

An excellent throw back to A Link To The Past with updated graphics, challenging puzzles and fantastic gameplay. Kept me occupied  for many, many hours and has a great story line with a satisfying ending. A must-have for any Zelda lover - especially someone who played the classic games!The game itself was one of the more challenging puzzle Zelda games, but easier on the actual combat side. An excellent game with great reply value. Highly recommend!

A great addition to the series
Reviewed in Canada on July 3, 2014Verified Purchase
Fantastic addition to the LoZ world. It feels much like Link to the Past but with a whole different story much like most of the other LoZ games.If you were ever a fan of the older titles then this will be a real treat for you. However, because it's much like the older titles like SNES,etc. You can easily beat this game in about 8-10 hours? Depending on if you're going for a complete 100% playthrough of the game (Be warned one Heart Fragment is won through a very annoying minigame).That one minigame is one of my few gripes with this game. Look up Ocotoball for this game and you'll see what I mean.There is Hero Mode that lets you play the game again where enemies do several times more damage while also unlocking some hidden plot devices. There's also a sub-mission where you rescue transdimensional squid babies...I'm serious....to get the item upgrades and possibly the most OP thing ever once you rescue all 100.A must have for all LoZ fans.

A Perfect Mix
Reviewed in Canada on February 5, 2014Verified Purchase
This is the perfect mix of nostalgia and progress. New game mechanics are actually interesting and awesome (as opposed to gimmicky as new mechanics so often are). Return to the flexibility to explore wherever and conquer dungeons in whichever order you please. Also particularly appreciated not having my hand held through every puzzle, dungeon, etc, as the recent Zelda games have been prone to do.May be my top Zelda alongside Ocarina and Wind Waker for re-playability, design, and sheer AWESOME!

AS mentioned in another review I did for Super Mario 3D World, this was more of a Christmas present to a friend. As far as I know, everything worked fine, was neatly sealed and arrived early. My friend was also able to live stream one of the games and go from there. So in conclusion, two awesome games for Christmas Presents to a friend. Another happy satisfied customer. Thank you Amazon.

Its so quiet and relaxing to use, best mouse for browsing
Reviewed in Canada on February 2, 2024Colour Name: GraphiteStyle: MX Master 3SVerified Purchase
I purchased a logitech G502x Plus but I found the clicks to be to loud for anything but watching videos, listening to music and gaming but as soon as I tried to look at photographs or web browse without headphones on it was way to loud so I looked online and found the MX Master 3S and wow it sure is quiet and its super relaxing feeling as in absolutely amazing comfort.  I like this mouse alot, its great but again the G502x  has the right feel for gaming while this mouse is super relaxing and gaming is a gamepad and there loud and that is how loud the G502x mouse is.  Id buy the MX Master 3S and watch the leds on the G502x because the led lights are so cool fading in and out but the noise is beyond a reasonable level for browsing without headphones.  The MX Master 3S is so quiet id say its the most amazing mouse.After using the MX Master 3S for quite a few hours im really right clicking more than you would think when I don't need to and that might be the only drawback other than the fact that if you wanted to use something more mouse feeling and present when its clicking than you might use a different mouse but so far im preferring that its quiet and not loud but there is something quite mechanical feeling when using the G502x Plus and some people might prefer that and it is nice to look and see the led light on but im also thinking that if the light isn't on you might not turn the led light on during the day to look at it because it doesn't need to be on but is nice to see when its on.  Im thinking mouses might be a collectable item to use when your feeling like a specific mouse, you might prefer to use a different mouse for every day that you use a mouse.

Reviewed in Canada on October 16, 2023Colour Name: GraphiteStyle: MX Master 3SVerified Purchase
....sad that i didn't know about this mouse earlier in life.I'm 6'3'' and have  a bigger than average hand. my main priority was searching for a mouse that was wide and comfortable enough. If a mouse is ever too small for me, my ring finger and pinky will feel quite uncomfortable by days end. The logitech M3S mouse did the trick. even though my pinky finger is 'floating' when using the mouse, the grip from the ring finger = no tried fingersThe customizability and re-mapping of buttons through the app is AMAZING. I feel like I'm taking advantage of my computer more with all the customizability. I feel like they could have added one or two more customizable buttons on the side. I'm always grimacing about which shortcut i should use for each dedicated button. but this is NOT A DEAL BREAKER.the matte feel of the mouse feels great in the handthe main magnet scroll wheel feels otherworldly and amazing, imo. strange sensation when you scroll and realize that it's only a magnet. if you're a fidget toy type of person, this wheel is the best thing in the world. you'll only only known when  you scroll on it.*** this is probably poor wording --- note that i left the setting to 'click' (like a traditional mouse scroll wheel) and then tried remapping this button to lets say, 'next music track'. Overtime and constantly clicking the button changed the scroll sensitivity from 'click' to 'smooth'. i haven't found a workaround to this issues. I just can't remap this button is all, but NOT A DEAL BREAKER.the side scroll wheel is welcomed. never had a mouse that has a second wheel, and i use it as master to control volume.i really thought of getting the logitech M2S cause it was half off at the time , but these following features made my decision to get the M3S:-USB-C - makes charging a breeze with one less cable type. though you wont be charging much with how long the battery lasts-the clicking is much much more quieter than the 2S. hearing keys typing all day on a keyboard is a lot over time. lessening the noise of the mouse was a welcomed feature to my home office-3S just looked much cleaner aesthetically compared to 2S. just a guess, but the 2S design choice made me think like it was going to get dirtier more faster over timeonly Con:-bluetooth connectivity can be an issue-M3S mouse lag is a real thing-Out of the box, I had to fiddle with all my 2.0 and 3.0 USB ports-Needed to check out online forums for a solution-realized that i had to use 2.0 USB port. 3.0 was making the mouse very laggy / stuttering on screen-i imagine all my other devices signals' are also interfering with this mouse-eventually got it to work though after trying every port. luckily i have several-if these connectivity problems persisted, i would have probably returned this mouse. but the mouse and features are also so good that i was also considering dealing with a lifetime headache just for the features. just saying9.5/10

I might have missed in the description that it has 'quiet clicks' or maybe I didn't know what that was going to mean, but I kind of hate it. Super mushy, no click. Half the time I'm not sure if I clicked or not.I guess it might be better for noise in an office setting?I still give it 4 stars because it is a very well built and comfortable mouse. It would be great if it had better switches.

Excellent Mouse, Options doesn't work on Mac for me, White version gets yellow
Reviewed in Canada on November 22, 2023Colour Name: Pale GreyStyle: MX Master 3SVerified Purchase
Could not get the software to work on either of my M1 Mac computers. Classic Options app requires you to download the ""new"" Options app, but the new Options app just stays loading and wastes CPU and battery and needs to be force closed.Instead, I use something called Mac Mouse Fix which doesn't have any issues working with this mouse. This software plus this mouse is amazing, as it makes the smooth scrolling REALLY smooth like a trackpad, but you can't adjust the force of the clicks like you can in Logitech Options.Battery life is fine, and after a while, the white version might start to get yellow slightly where touched often, even if wiped down with 70% alc frequently.

Powerful Vlogging Camera!
Reviewed in Canada on November 12, 2016Style: CameraVerified Purchase
This is my purchase of the year! It is a perfect camera for vlogging, very practical to bring everywhere with you, easy to operate, and lots of setting options. I film 95% of my vlogs indoors and it performs very well in low-light conditions and you can adjust the aperture setting to the point where a pitch black room can look like you are in a room with lots of natural light - it is insane! Auto-focus is quite fast and I love that you can adjust the background to get the blurry effect so it looks cinematic. I heard 50/50 reviews about sound quality and honestly...I think this camera has great quality. I tested it in a room where there is a lot of echoing while I was talking filming a segment and had my iPhone 6s and a voice recorder operating all at the same time. When I got home to compare the audio from all the devices, this camera picked up my voice the best. If you are that precise with your sound quality though, I would suggest you buying a separate cardioid microphone and just syncing your audio and video when editing. I have not had to do this yet as I really have not encountered audio issues. Please note that there is no external microphone jack - I know a lot of people ask about this. :-)I purchased this product in October - it arrived a week and a half earlier than the expected delivery date which was a huge bonus, however when I received the package there was a minor issue that I contacted the seller. They gave me some options on what I would like to do, which was quite accommodating. Customer service was great.I have not used the camera to its full potential yet, but I am excited to test it out more since I really only got to play with it for about a week.I hope you will find this review helpful!

Reviewed in Canada on December 3, 2022Style: CameraVerified Purchase
This has become my go  to camera since I've gotten it. It's a great little camera to take around with you everywhere. The quality is amazing . I use the camera when I don't want to use my big DSLR and it's amazing for my vlogs. I highly recommend this camera for people who created a lot of videos and a lot of content for social media well as an everyday camera for amazing pictures.Really worth it and great price!

Amazing little camera.
Reviewed in Canada on April 19, 2018Style: CameraVerified Purchase
I wanted to find a camera that would last me for the next five years as I needed a small, portable and powerful point-and-shoot camera for my travels. When I visited Japan after Fukushima, I had brought my DSLR and regretted as it was simply too heavy to move around and ended barely using it. In preparation for my one-month trip to Romania, I purchased this camera after doing much research and found this camera to be amazing. I love the flip screen and how flexible it was. The quality of the photos is amazing for such a small device. My only issue is the battery life. I highly recommend that you purchase another battery or two when traveling for the entire day. I like the Wi-Fi feature so I don't have to plug it into my computer. It works very well for ultra laptops with almost no USB slot if any.

Reviewed in Canada on June 23, 2023Style: CameraVerified Purchase




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 Easy to use, solid zoom (a bit slow to complete if recording while zooming), bright colours, great audio capture, articulated screen makes for great selfies and talking-head shots, auto is fantastic as a setting and fast to capture, wide variety of customization per-shot in manual mode if you desire, rotating bezel around camera lens for zoom is a fun touch.I mean, if you want in depth there are a ton of online resources that can dig in to the specs (that's what I did to make my decision). But, frankly, I'm just a real guy looking for a good casual-use cam with video. And that's what this was.  I can't sing it's praises any more than I already have. Would recommend for SURE!Seller was great - Item arrived sooner than expected, item was well packaged, no need for customer service.

Great Camera
Reviewed in Canada on April 12, 2020Style: CameraVerified Purchase
Love the touchscreen how it can flip to look at yourself. Great for vlogs - I brought this with me for a few travel trips. Great for someone who isn't too technical into cameras and want something simple to take pictures and videos with. Love it. Only thing to beware - the battery life can deplete quicker than you think if you're using it to film long footages at a time, but the camera itself is incredibly easy to use and a lot of fun.

The camera itself is outstanding! One thing that bothered me is the fact that they advertise it as new but the one I received looks like it was used and has a little dent on the lens as well as the contents inside the box were all opened and unsealed, It would be nice if they can sort out that situation but other than that no complaints!

I love these earplugs so much, I’m considering buying them in other colours. I go to a lot of concerts and have always been nervous about my hearing health as a result. For the past few years I’ve been using the terrible foam ones that they sell at venues or the drug store, but never felt like they were doing enough. These Loop ear plugs don’t muffle the sound, but just make it quieter. I haven’t experienced ringing ears since I bought these. The last time I wore them, one of my friends mentioned that our other friend was so smart to have brought ear plugs, thinking I wasn’t wearing any; these actually look like jewellery! Lastly, they’re so comfortable and feel so secure, I almost forget I’m wearing them. With the old foam kind, I felt like I was constantly adjusting them. I’m so happy with this purchase.

Works great! Have to get used to wearing it
Reviewed in Canada on June 28, 2022Verified Purchase
Overall I am very happy with the loop earplugs. It helps with my ADHD/Anxiety for the most part.Positives: It definitely helps reduce background noise. I'm still able to hear the very talkative dog down the street but it's quieter and I'm able to focus on what I'm doing. I went grocery shopping with my brother and it was really awesome in the sense that I didn't feel like there was so much going on around me. I have ADHD and when I walk into a grocery store I see everything, I think about each product and if I need it, I'm hearing people talking, etc. It's annoying and overwhelming but with the earplugs in it did reduce that a LOT. Not completely, but I felt less overwhelmed.I wear them when I'm sleeping, if I'm trying to focus on something during the day (mowing the lawn, working on comp, cleaning), passenger in the car.. it's helped my brain a lot.Negatives: As much noise it does reduce, it also makes it a bit harder to hear people close to me if there are other noises going on. You can still hear the noises you would normally hear just at lower levels. It's similar to when someone is talking to you. If it's in a quiet environment like home and I'm talking to my brother then that's fine, but when we went shopping and he was RIGHT beside me, it made it very frustrating that I had to ask him to repeat himself. That's only because of the other noises going on: music, people chatting, workers, etc. I did sometimes have to remove the earplug which wasn't a big deal but it did make me feel more anxious in the moment.Another negative is the loop earplug case. I have dropped it twice and both times it opens and the earplugs come out.I don't like that at all because I almost lost one (took a while to find it, I honestly didn't even realize the case fell until I was going to bed). Then they get dirty and I have to clean them. The case itself is very sturdy, it survived both falls but I don't like that it popped open so easily and my earplugs came out.

Totally recommend - from a neurodivergent with noise sensitivity
Reviewed in Canada on April 6, 2024Colour Name: Experience FluxVerified Purchase
I've been seeing Loops on my social media feeds for months and in preparation for my trip to Nashville I finally bit the bullet and bought a pair. I was a little nervous reading reviews that they might fall out and I'd lose them, but I was delighted when I found that I didn't have that issue. I used my Loops while walking down busy streets with music playing in every bar; in bars at night; and at multiple concert venues. I found I could still hear everything really well, but the intensity of the noise was dampened. I was able to enjoy multiple nights out with loud music and people, which would normally be very difficulty for me, without getting overstimulated and needing to leave. For anyone who has noise sensitivity or wants to protect their ears at concerts/loud events, I would totally recommend the Loops.My one note is that when it isn't super loud, it can be hard to hear the people beside you when they're speaking to you. My Loops can't really filter the sound I want dampened vs the sound I don't, but it's easy enough to remove one if needed or to have the person speak up a bit. In very loud settings like crowded bars or music venues I didn't notice that problem.

You buy a console for the simplicity. You buy them because there, for the most part, guaranteed to run any game released on said console smoothly without the worry of drivers, video card compatibility, etc.Get a console if you play games for fun.

A fun playthrough!
Reviewed in Canada on July 12, 2015Verified Purchase
This game is another excellent addition to the series. I particularly like the online features, and Game Freak/Nintendo occasionally releases patches with new content.One of the unique new additions to this game is the ""sneak"" mechanic which is extremely fun to use, and helps with finding rare Pokemon. There are also many legendary Pokemon from generations 3-5 to find, so completing the Pokedex is easier! I was definitely not disappointed with the plot. It was changed up from the original Hoenn plot, but still maintains the old themes and characters.

The music is incredible, probably the best pokemon sound track since the original ruby and saphire lol. Only complaint is the game is definitely on the easy side, but I can look past it.

If you are complaining about ""berry farms"", head over to route 123 and go up the hill. It has 24 berry planting spots.Edit: I spent 500 hours on it now, eating to get Sun and Moon. If you have the chance between this and that, get the new one they moved some features there and removed them from here.

UNO - The Ultimate Family Card Game!
Reviewed in Canada on July 26, 2023Style: UNOVerified Purchase
As a long-time fan of card games, I recently had the pleasure of trying out the classic UNO card game, and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations! UNO has been a staple in family game nights for decades, and I can see why it continues to stand the test of time.First and foremost, UNO is incredibly easy to learn, making it suitable for players of all ages. The simple rules allow young children to join in the fun, while the strategic elements keep adults engaged and entertained. It's the perfect game to bring together family and friends, fostering a sense of camaraderie and laughter.The game comes neatly packaged in a sturdy box, and the cards are of excellent quality, ensuring they withstand countless rounds of gameplay. The vibrant colors and iconic UNO logo on the cards add a touch of excitement to every hand.UNO's gameplay is fast-paced and thrilling. The objective is to be the first player to empty your hand, and along the way, you'll encounter various action cards like Skip, Reverse, and Draw Two, which can turn the tables in an instant! The wildly unpredictable Wild and Wild Draw Four cards add an extra layer of excitement, keeping everyone on their toes.One of the aspects I appreciate most about UNO is its versatility. The game can be adapted to suit different play styles and preferences. Whether you prefer a more relaxed match or an intense, competitive showdown, UNO can accommodate it all. Additionally, it's an excellent icebreaker for parties or a quick game during breaks.The UNO card game is an excellent tool for building essential life skills like critical thinking, decision-making, and planning. While it may seem like a simple game on the surface, it challenges players to strategize and anticipate their opponents' moves, all while managing their own hand.My only minor suggestion would be to include a scoring pad or a small notepad in the box to keep track of points during lengthier sessions, especially if you're playing with more than four players.In conclusion, UNO has truly earned its reputation as a classic card game. Its blend of accessibility, fun, and strategic depth make it a must-have addition to any game collection. Whether you're looking for a game to enjoy with family, friends, or even as an icebreaker in social gatherings, UNO is the perfect choice. I wholeheartedly recommend UNO to everyone, and I guarantee it will provide endless hours of laughter and enjoyment!

I replaced my ps2 which was the later slim version back to the older version of it because it was very old and disk wasnt spinning/didn't recognize the disk when put it into the holder. This works with an HDMI cable just like the previous slim one i had. Ive had no issues with the product and i was even able to play a game on this type of ps2 that i wasnt able to play on the slim version due to compatibility issues. Would reccomend this product anyday. Came delivered in excellent condition as described with no damage upon arrival.

Console works fine, controller won't work.

Can't find anywhere to contact the seller so unfortunately I'll have to leave this here. The controller isn't responding at all. I'm going to borrow a friend's controller to see if it's the system or the actual controller. Ps2 was in good condition otherwise.Update: The console works perfect, the controller definitely does not. I picked up some wireless controllers and have been enjoying the nostalgia. So if you order a ps2 make sure you have an extra controller lined up just in case.

The ps2 was exactly as promised, wasnt overly dusty. It came with a controller and all the wires. I used it to play kingdom hearts, the game was a bit blurry but that has less to do with th condition of the console and more with the game not fitting to the proper ratio of the tv. This is an issue with a lot of ps2 consoles.

Unfortunately it also looks like someone took steel wool to the top of the system, it was really not in very good shape. It does work and for that reason I will keep it.

Nails are doing great, hair is looking promising
Reviewed in Canada on December 6, 2020Verified Purchase
I’ve just about finished my first bottle of these, and I’m pretty satisfied with them so far.First and foremost, nails. I’ve always been a nail biter, but once I started taking these I set my mind to stopping and my nails have grown beautifully. They’re much stronger than they used to be, I remember at least one occasion where I knocked my nail and was shocked to find it hadn’t broken — before these vitamins, it definitely would not survived that impact.Because I’ve always been a nail biter, it’s hard for me to comment on growth speed (mine never had a chance to get very long. However, I’ve had friends remark that they’ve grown very quickly, so I guess that means they’re doing pretty good.As for hair, I think growth has sped up slightly in some places other than my head. Personally I don’t really care, especially since it’s winter I hardly notice. I would say, don’t worry about that too much — it’s not noticeable. I think my head hair growth has accelerated slightly, and I’m only one bottle in. It’s too early to comment on health: it takes months for a noticeable difference in hair health to develop, with vitamins that’s just how it is. I’m hopeful though.Importantly, I want to comment on acne. Picking these up, I was extremely concerned about whether or not they’d make me breakout. One of my friends eventually dropped these because she couldn’t deal with the acne anymore. For me, in the first week, I did break out for a few days, but it was over within a week. It’s also possible that my breakout was due to other things. Since then, I’ve noticed no real increase in my acne. I’m very happy about this. If acne is a concern for you, just remember that it’s not unusual for your body to take upwards of a month to adjust to these. It’s different for everyone, and I think it’s worth it for you to give them a chance.I find the flavour a bit... strange. It is extremely artificial, but very sweet. Most will like it (my boyfriend is always asking me for one whenever he catches me taking them). I honestly don’t mind it, but I certainly wouldn’t rave about it.Prices fluctuate on these a lot. Try to catch them when they’re on the low end. For me, I bought the bottle of 80 for 6.68 CAD. Pretty sure it went up around 3 bucks the day after I bought them.First time I bought them they didn’t arrive, had to wait 3 days for them to send out a new shipment of my order (free of charge). Pretty sure that’s my local carrier’s fault though, and the Amazon customer service was good as always.All in all, if you’re looking for a gummy to add to your daily routine and give your hair and nails some love, this is a very good candidate. I definitely recommend trying it.

Have Used This Product For Few Months
Reviewed in Canada on January 27, 2024Verified Purchase
I bought my first bottle of these at a big box store. Didn't notice till I had got home and opened the bottle that all the gummies were stuck together. I used the opposite end of a spoon to break them apart as needed. Not difficult to do. I was hoping that these 2 bottles that I purchased from Amazon might be a little fresher and not be stuck together. No such luck! Expiry date is well into 2025 so they are fresh. I think when packaged the gummies are still to warm? and/or wet? and stick together as they cool off/dry. No biggie. They taste delicious and I have noticed a huge improvement in my nails, and a slight improvement in my hair and skin. My nails use to be quite soft, they are so hard now. No longer split and dont break either. Wow! Done some research and apparently it takes a few months till you really notice a difference in your hair - which is the primary reason I bought these - its really thinning out as I age.

Best budget console on the market!
Reviewed in Canada on February 14, 2022Platform for display: Xbox Series SEdition: Console OnlyVerified Purchase
The Xbox Series S is the second Microsoft console I own since the 360. It comes with a 512-gigabyte hard drive and a wireless controller. Although there is no CD drive, the console is all-digital and allows multiple users to download and play their purchased games from the Windows Store. The only drawback is that if you want more storage space, you may have to buy an external hard drive. I recommend the Seagate brand with the Xbox logo on it.The resolution is set at 1440p and you still get decent quality. You may not notice much graphical difference on the other version, the Series X. Best of all, you can play the Xbox Series S on your computer monitor if you own the ""Elgato HD60s+,""  the game capture device, if desired. From my own experience, I don't need an expensive television to get the best graphics, so I play it right from my I-Mac 2019 with the retina display monitor.If you are looking for a budget console and just want to play your games casually or with a game pass, then the Series S is right for you. With a sleek design look, the system is lightweight, small, and very easy to carry if you are going on a trip. Perfect for both new and hardcore gamers for this generation.

Just what I was looking for!
Reviewed in Canada on July 11, 2022Platform for display: Xbox Series SEdition: Console OnlyVerified Purchase
It seemed impossible to find and buy these consoles for over a year until I got a notification that they were available for purchase on Amazon for the exact same price as the Microsoft store.I bought this before cloud gaming was good. Now that the Xbox team worked hard on perfecting cloud gaming, it's only gotten better. I am just a Gold member, but my room mate has Game Pass. I have daily played games downloaded directly to the drive, and most other games are available on cloud (though I do download them and them delete them from the drive or move them to my other drive that is not SSD).I don't have a new TV (in fact I still have a 'dumb' TV) and it's only capable of so much despite it being 4k UHD capable, games play flawlessly. One of my main games is OW and the new OW2. I have it set to have balance between performance and quality on both games and they both play without any issues and barely any latencies (thanks quality internet!).If you get the S series and have Game Pass you will not be disappointed. If you're looking for a bigger hard drive Get the Series X or buy a compatible SSD drive.This console is more than capable for playing everyday. I use it for everything, from playing games to listening to Spotify to watching my favorite series and shows on all the apps in 4k UHD. Never had any issues with the console what so ever.Also very easy to set up with any home systems you have. I use Google Home and can easily use voice commands to turn it on/off and load up any app or game.My ONLY issue are with the controllers. The new Series S/X controllers are great out of the box, but after 9-12 months of use they go bunk. If you use a wired head set expect it to stop working/start echoing/come in and out within the year. The bumpers don't last long either. I never throw it around and I keep it clean, and despite the up keep I still have issues. Good thing they go on sale often. I will never pay full price for the controllers because they just don't last in my experience.

Powerful Semi-Gen Console!
Reviewed in Canada on November 16, 2020Platform for display: Xbox Series SEdition: Console OnlyVerified Purchase
I've have the Series S for a couple of days now and let me tell you, this is a perfect console for me. I've had the original Xbox and the Xbox 360 and even though I passed on the Xbox one (because of their first E3 presentation) and bought a PS4 instead I was hesitant going with Xbox again but they really improve ever since Phil Spencer took over the reigns of the Xbox division.first off, don't let the small size fool you. It's a pretty powerful and heavy/dense console.I'm still so amazed of how quiet it is compared to my ps4 (mind you it's a launch ps4 and surprised it's still alive)but as for the series S, it truly feels like a console unlike its bigger brother the series X which harkens more to a high end pc the series s fills that void left in me by the 360. it brings back so many good memories that it really is my favorite console to date.eventually I am planning on getting a PS5 for Sony games but as for Xbox games, if you don't have a 4K tv like me and you don't plan on upgrading you home system equipment then this is a perfect console for you. But be aware of the lower end GPU and the smaller hard drive space, but if you download one or two AAA games you still have enough room for a handful of smaller games.so in conclusion, I say this is a good product to buy if you can find it. if you want to wait it out and see if you want the X instead then go for it! you won't be disappointed!

Big bang for few bucks!
Reviewed in Canada on November 10, 2021Platform for display: Xbox Series SEdition: Console OnlyVerified Purchase
I have been a console gamer for many years, and I can safely say that the X Box Series S is a solid investment for both new comers and console veterans alike. While it may not be the most powerful of the new generation consoles it does offer excellent performance on a 1080p display. Paired with the incredible content and low price of X Box’s Gamepass online game service, the Series S is a fantastic value at only $400 (CAD) and $16 per month subscription. The only real drawback in comparison to it’s big brother the Series X and Sony’s PS5 counterpart is that the Series S is not capable of delivering 4K graphics, and maxes out at 1440p. But anyone running on a small gaming monitor or older HDTV will have no complaints about the graphical fidelity of this console. I highly recommend this product.

My first foray into alcohol markers and these are a great beginner set. They blend nicely, wide variety of colours. I wish they came in order for colours but it was funny to organize them myself with the kids.I find they do bleed a lot, and some of them would send out a bit splatter from being very moist when they’d be opened.But they blend so nicely on their own, although I don’t really know how to use the blender marker, that’s a learning curve for sure. But such nice colours!Other reviews mention they bleed through the paper so make sure you have a protector paper behind whatever you are colouring to keep the page behind it safe. If the marker is dry seeming they have instruction to flip the dry side down to let the ink flow to the dry top for 30 minutes. But none I have used have been dry yet.

I love the selection and variety that come in this huge package of markers. I was blown away at all the color choices. My daughter and I use them all the time and the ink is still going strong. The colors are very bright and vibrant. Just be careful on the types of paper you use them on as they will bleed through to the other side on thinner papers. They are blendable, and easy to use, and much more affordable than the copic brand markers. We totally recommend them!

Great value and quality. All the markers worked and comes in a single heavy duty case that comes with a shoulder strap. The markers are fitted inside 4 plastic slots so they don't move around in the bag haphazardly.  It comes with 2 pieces of paper to mark down the colors. I created my own instead.I have another set I bought from Aliexpress a few years ago but many markers came dried out and it also costs a third more. I really recommend this set. Beware that it bleeds through many pages of paper so you may need to protect your desk with many sheets underneath.

I recently bought some bobbie goods colouring book and was on the hunt for a marker set with lots of colours without breaking the bank.Pros:- Lots of colours- Comes in a heavy duty bag with strap- Budget friendly- Pens have two different tips- Markers themselves are good quality- Customer Service is very responsiveCons:- The blender does not work, it just adds a white layer and does not blend- There aren’t many beige colours, I had to buy another set of only beige shades (this might not be an issue depending on what you plan on colouring)- I wish it came with a swatch sheet template like other markers do. I had to print out my own.

These markers tested very well. They blended fine and left little or no lines. They gave a good assortment of colours to choose from. However, there are a few draw backs: 1) The markers are in no order when they arrive and you will have to spend a bit of time creating and sorting your colour chart; 2) while the caps gave different names and showed different colours, when tested the colours were identical. I tested on several paper types and had the same colour match. I found at least ten markers of similar matching colour tones.

 The Echo Dot is the best selling and most popular Echo Speaker but if you're not a fan of the round spherical, baseball design then the Echo Pop is a much better looking more stylish smart speaker.  The Echo Pop also comes in more colors than the Echo Dot, so if color is your thing the Pop is Perfect for you.This review is broken down into two parts.  Part 1 is short and sweet, while Part 2 is more detailed.PART 1:The all new Echo Pop (2023) is a stylish looking speaker, available in several colors with similar sound to the Echo Dot, but not as loud.  Both the Echo Dot and New Echo POP are designed to be used in smaller rooms.  The Echo Pop sounds good for its size however there is minimal bass and it doesn't get very loud.  For better sound you can use 2 Echo Pops and Pair them in Stereo which greatly improves this speakers sound performance but at a twice the cost.  The Echo Dot (baseball looking speaker) sound slightly better but has other features such as tap gestures, temperature sensor and option for a built in LED clock display.The Echo Pop is perfect for someone who wants a slightly smaller speaker and wants added style, color and flair.  Both the Dot and Pop sound similar but the dot will go louder so the Pop is for small rooms and more of a convenience speaker for smart home control, timers, weather, etc ... as opposed to listening to music.Overall I like the Echo Pop a look.  I prefer the LOOK of the POP and like the color choices.  The sound is decent for it's size but a bit overpriced for a music speaker.  If you're buying a speaker for music get the larger, full sized Echo Smart Speaker.  The echo POP is perfect for kids where they can have their own colourful smart speaker that can't be turned up too loud so the music is blaring throughout the house.  Again as a small, personal speaker it's great.  Kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, and personal office desk speaker are the obvious choices for this stylish smart speaker.  The microphone is excellent and if you can pick it up on sale it's a great value priced Smart Speaker.  I would recommend and would purchase another one for use as a Stereo Pair when they are on sale.PART 2:I have owned all the Echo Speakers from the past decade.  In the product lineup the Echo Pop is in the middle between the Echo Flex and Echo Dot.  The Echo POP is bigger and sounds better than the Echo Flex but not quite as good as the Echo Dot.The Echo Pop looks better and is much more stylish than any of the other echo speakers.The microphones on the Echo pop are sensitive and work well even from across the room or when the music is full blast.The sound is good considering the size of the POP but it does lack bass and volume.  I was surprised that the Echo Pop did not distort too much at loud volume levels with lots of base.  That's partly because there is not a lot of bass with this speaker to begin with and it processes the sound to give you the most volume it can while cutting back the bass the louder you turn the volume up.MISSING FEATURES:The Echo Pop is $15 less than the Echo Dot, however you do give up a number of features and a bit of bass and volume for the price drop.  There is No Free Lunch here .... Yes the Echo POP is lower priced but it does not have the temperature sensor, EERO mesh Wi-Fi access point feature, tapping and touch features and the option for a clock.  The temperature sensor can be used to trigger home automation rules.  If you have an EERO Wi-Fi mesh network the Echo Dot 5th gen can be used as a wireless access point.  The tap and touch feature can be useful to tap to play or stop an alarm for example.  If you have any need or value for these features then the Echo Dot would be a better smart speaker choice.RECOMMENDATION:I think the Echo POP will become one of Amazon's Best Selling Smart Speakers, not because it sounds great, but because it looks so good and has decent sound for its size.  The vast majority of smart speaker users probably don't need the temperature sensor, EERO network integration and tap/touch capability.  Let's face it, most of us want to talk to our smart speaker and don't ever touch it.  I can't remember when I'm touched any of my smart speakers.  Voice commands are generally the way most of use will interface with our smart speakers.I would recommend the Echo Pop, especially if it goes on sale.  The sound from the Echo Pop is much better in stereo so if you can afford two, I would recommend buying two and hooking them up as a stereo pair.  While the Echo Dot is not Amazon's Best Sounding Speaker it may become the most popular ... time will tell.

Echo Pop, a good way to ease into Smart Homes.
Reviewed in Canada on July 15, 2023Colour Name: Lavender BloomConfiguration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
Interestingly, despite being a 101 user when it comes to Smart technology and Amazon's speakers in general, I was surprised to see several huge bits of misinformation in the self-proclaimed ""Tech Guy's"" review -- stuff that's in the very first page of the little starter pamphlet.First, it does have touch controls. Touching the top acts as a snooze to an alarm, and the gesture is available in the Blueprints (like Extensions etc, except even easier, they let you easily chart out behaviour for your Pop using a single command or situation being met. It's a nice introduction to AI).Second, it does have EERO wifi extension built-in. Like the Dot, it still requires an Eero router to make use of this, but if you already have that set up, it's a nice way to double up both another speaker/microphone and extend your home wifi coverage.I'm new to Smart Homes and assistive devices, but not to tech or programming, so it was an easy transition for me. My place isn't very big, so a lot of Smart possibilities are nice but aren't yet things I feel I couldn't live without -- give me a few years and a handful of plugs, however, and we'll see what I can set up!What I specifically wanted the Pop for was the fact that it works seamlessly with Audible (both US and Canada), and I was tired of retrieving my phone from the tub after my single-brain-cell orange potato kept knocking it in while attempting to supervise my daily attempts at drowning myself from 3 inches away. He is an excellent lifeguard, except for when he falls in himself, and then it's everyone for themselves.I mistakenly read part of the information as ""the Echo Pop is wireless"" as meaning it had an internal battery that could be charged, and no, that is very much not the case. Since the brilliant electrician wired it so that the bathroom outlets are only turned on when the light is turned on, that's not so hot for the Pop as it needs to be continually plugged in. It's workable, and sounds a whole lot better than my phone's speakers, so I figure it will just have to deal with being hard restarted regularly. Since the boot-up time is fast, it's not really an issue unless you really wanted it as a portable speaker.I spent some time playing with and customizing its various features, which was easy. I was a little disappointed to not see YouTube Music as compatible, but I'm not really surprised with Amazon offering their own service. I was able to find plenty of Canadian content, including CBC news and radio, as well as a surprising flexibility in both temperature AND distance measurements as I'm a Gen-Xer who still uses Celsius and inches/miles. Don't ask, it's a thing.The little manual is also helpful for explaining what the different colours the light bar at the top of the unit mean -- it was yellow, which took me a bit to realize meant I had an Alexa-specific notification. I was able to listen to it and delete it without any problems, but this might explain why some people are having the light on all the time.Most important was a HUGE surprise -- that the Echo line will do accessible text-to-speech reading of Kindle ebooks. This is something that disappeared from Kindle units themselves ages ago, and as I have been steadily losing my vision for the past 20 years, it's a feature I have sorely missed. I switched to audiobooks about 10 years ago, but not all books are released in audio, they're significantly more expensive, and my Kindle library is huge and full of books I'd like to enjoy again.Having that accessibility feature returned has been incredible. I love my audiobooks, don't get me wrong -- I've found several performers I enjoy so much I follow them much like I follow favourite authors -- and text-to-speech is not even close to a replacement, but it's SOMETHING. I've been able to enjoy books I haven't read in years thanks to this, and I can do so without having to be controlling a screen-reader or setting up auto-scroll on my PC and the like.Sound quality wise, I love it. I have headphones at work and a set of decent earbuds while commuting/outside/errands, but I like to give my ears a rest (and batteries a charge) at home. I didn't realize just how much I was settling, sound-wise, until I started using the Pop. I like ambient noise as much as background music or news, and the Pop handles all of these without issue, meaning I no longer count daily steps within my own apartment due to needing to carry my phone everywhere.I also really like the fact that the Alexa app it works with lets you assign media streams to different bluetooth devices, fiddle with balance, and keeps multiple threads in memory so I can switch between ebook to audiobook to radio to music on one screen, or just via voice commands, and can resume any of the others where I left off with another command.Overall I'm pretty thrilled! I looked at more expensive options but in the end the Pop was exactly what I was looking for. It's lightweight but rugged enough to survive being knocked to the floor easily (not that my furry potato would EVER do such a thing), robust when I expected something fairly tinny, and is a really easy jumping-off point to Smart Homes as there is tons of information and easy to set up things from plugs to lights to door locks. The AI Blueprints section for building your own routines is extremely straightforward but also very open-ended. There's no temperature sensor in the Pop, but you can set things so that when home temp is over 23°C, it switches on a fan or little standing AC unit. When your alarm goes off, it also turns the kettle on. If it hears your dog barking, it can turn on some music or radio to help distract them and keep them company.So far no solutions for the potato, but hope springs eternal. He can no longer foil my plans entirely by laying completely on my phone or Kindle, however, especially not to muffle alarms, the jerk.Was the Prime Day price worth it to out-smart and out-stubbourn my cat?Oh, so very much so. Alexa forgives me for unplugging and replugging them in if I change rooms at this point, although they're likely exasperated I didn't just buy two -- which is probably what I should have done, and will likely do in the future. It'll still reset every time I turn the bathroom light off, but maybe I can put a smart light in there...

Perfect budget smart speaker!
Reviewed in Canada on July 12, 2023Colour Name: Midnight TealConfiguration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
I’ve been looking for a bluetooth speaker to keep in my room for a while, and the Echo Pop seemed to fit the bill with the added smart compatibility.I’ve had the device for a couple days now and finally feel comfortable writing a review on it now that I’ve had a chance to use it in my daily life.So far, this is an amazing little device. It fits perfectly on the shelf beside my bed and the lavender colour is beautiful, it feels very well made and soft with fabric covering and soft plastic covering the device.Moving onto setting up the device, it was a breeze! I pre connected my amazon account when ordering, and once I had the alexa app installed the setup only took a few minutes.The speaker quality is really good for the size, it’s pretty loud and clear! Perfect for what I wanted it for, which was music while gaming. You can connect music through bluetooth on  a device, or by asking alexa to play certain songs/albums/playlists. Both options work great!But I don't only use this device for music, I’ve found it useful into turning my room from a normal room into a smart-room! I am able to control my firestick connected to my tv hands free by simply asking Alexa to play something on my fire tv, perfect for those late lazy movie nights!Alexa has also proven herself useful when getting ready for the day, Im able to ask her what the weather is so I know how to dress/be prepared, and what time it is when my phone isn’t in reachOverall, I really recommend this speaker! 5 stars from me, and I will be getting more to put in the home!

Update: As of Oct. 31, Alexa will no longer work with IFTT. I wish I’d known this before I purchased. Now I’ll have to look to another home hub to control automations. Not sure how long Alexa will last in my house now, but I expect to replace it now.***I purchased this primarily to set up smart home options as a hub. It’s a great help for keeping track of all my food, family activities, chores, shopping lists, etc…and can be used with smart lighting, cleaning robots, IFTTT automations, etc. Even my home security has some functionality with it! Too bad a lot of options aren’t readily available in Canada.

My TV and more
Reviewed in Canada on December 22, 2023Configuration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
I started with the Echo 8, and I love that one.  But I wanted something larger for my bedroom to use as a TV plus with the Alexa features.  This is it.  I took advantage of the monthly payment plan and the boxing week deal so it wasnt full price.  I find that when I put it together, it worked better for me to not have other devices on my wifi, so I shut off my computer and phone, as I find that the download updates etc work better (and yes, my wifi is strong enough but this is finicky).  Once it got going I had issues with the widgets, I struggled getting them to stay on the home screen and then I just gave up.  I then noticed I got up in the morning and they were there as they should be so, not sure if you just have to give up to get those on.  I really love this device and all the bells and whistles the app has.  I use it for routines, lights, scheduling, TV shows - it really is sweet.  Because I mounted it on the wall, I do want you to know it does have a wall mount that comes with it.  I did purchase one separately that can swivel, but thats because I thought I had to, and you do not.  It has a bracket that you screw into the wall and then hang it on there.  works great.  I will return the other swivel.  I have moved the Echo show 8 to the kitchen I find the speakers in the 8 fantastic for music, and the 15 has great sound but the bass in the 8 is excellent for music.  Overall, Im delighted and in love with the Alexa app.

Great screen, bigger and thicker than you'd think.
Reviewed in Canada on September 28, 2023Configuration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
Super bright and crisp touchscreen, great for watching shows in the kitchen or elsewhere. But compared to a 12.9"" iPad Pro, this is much much thicker, with much bigger bezels. Sounds quality is on par with the iPad Pro, which is surprising since you'd think the extra space would be used for bigger better speakers. But it's not designed to be a portable device, so once it's in place, you don't notice the size too much. Just that great big screen.And, hopefully this can be fixed with software, but using Netflix is annoying, because the interface has an emulated remote control that you have to touch...it's not the tablet or touch UI, which is much more usable.

I like the Echo Show 15 for its sleek design, big screen, and Fire TV integration. It can act as a family hub, a photo frame, and a media streamer. The widgets are really useful for displaying information and reminders. The visual ID feature can recognize different users and show their personalized content. The Fire TV feature lets me watch my favorite shows and movies on the display. I hung it in my breakfast table area. I watch my morning news on it every morning.

You can hang this up as a picture on your wall, or find the perfect mount for your dresser, or under your cabinet in your kitchen. This is an extremely useful and versatile tool. I really liked it, just realized that it’s extremely big. If you’re looking for something smaller, go with something smaller Like the echo 10, or echo eight or five.  A pretty expensive alarm clock for me. Lol but it is super cool.  It was a bit hard to set up at first, but just watch a few YouTube videos, and you will be navigating through it in no time.

So much promise - so little delivery
Reviewed in Canada on October 18, 2022Configuration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
DEC 2022 Update.Well, they did it.  This device was below average, but they put new firmware on, and it's totally USELESS now.  I am looking for a Chromebook to hang on my wall to replace it, as we speak.  There is no more browser, which means some native apps, like Netflix and Youtube.  But now these two things have almost zero voice control, and the only way to work them is to use an on-screen mouse, which is way worse than it sounds.  Oh wait, you can BUY an ""Echo Show Remote""... they keep reminding me.  Oh yeah, and youtube app.. ads are now unskippable.  Unlike in the browser.  So if you don't BUY youtube, you are stuck watching the godawful 3 to 10 minute ads.FROM BAD TO WORSE.I was REALLY excited about this device.  I mean, REALLY excited.  I pre-ordered it on the first day it was available.  I waited through delays, and was thrilled to get it the day after it became available.  It looked fine on the wall, and even though it seemed limited, I assumed that development was ongoing, and that it would get better.Well, one year on, and it hasn't improved one single bit.  I honestly don't think there is ANY development for this device - and that includes Amazon and Third Party.  And why would a third party develop for this platform?  You can only have a few plugins installed at any time, and Amazon uses almost all those slots, plugging its music and its sales platforms.It's not a very responsive device - touching the screen is very laggy, and to be honest, I wish voice control was better, because actually touching the device makes it much less desirable, due to fingerprints.  Some things that should be no-brainers, like idle slide-shows for example, work sometimes and not others.  Music services are useless.  You are going to have to use Youtube on the VERY laggy browser provided, and it runs poorly (to say the least).So what you essentially have here is a glorified Echo Dot, with a screen.  I had so many hopes for this device.  And it dashed them all.  And, as I mentioned earlier, there is no development, no updates on the device.  It feels like an abandoned platform.

Reviewed in Canada on February 14, 2016Verified Purchase
These units are great (I've bought two). I couldn't compare them to any other studio monitor, as they're the first I've bought, but the sound quality beats anything I have in my home, or anything my friends have. It sounds crisp and clean, enabling me to be able to effectively mix and master properly to the best of my current ability as a bedroom producer.Only thing that made me worry, was that one of them started to make a kind of mid to high pitch monotone sound after I had been using it for about 8-10 hours straight one day. Worried me right after the fact, but the next day I fired them up and they didn't have any issues. Only happened once so far, but I was probably asking for it after using them for so long (no, I wasn't crazy on the volume either.)Just want to remind people, they're studio monitors, not a PA system. All my friends had expected that they'd be louder. They're meant for accuracy, not brute strength.As my first studio monitor purchase, very pleased!(Been using for about 5 months, moderate to heavy use)

Reviewed in Canada on April 6, 2024Verified Purchase
I am really enjoying this product so far. A tip is to make sure you shave before hand. Apply lotion to your whole body and then apply the gel. Rub it in circles and keep blending it in (or use a mitt if you have one). Apply lotion on top. The first time I applied it I ended up really streaky and patchy in places I didn’t blend out/ apply lotion. Apply less than you think you need.Pros: really nice colour with one use, applies clear, no self tan smell, transfer proof.Cons: patchy and streaky if not worked in enoughI find using lotion before and after application is key to getting an even colour.

It works…maybe a little too orange
Reviewed in Canada on March 22, 2024Verified Purchase
This one was a roller coaster! When I received it, the pump didn’t work for a solid 10 minutes of trying. Eventually, it started to actually pump so that crisis was averted since there’s no clear instructions on how much of it to use (TikTok’s suggested 1-2 pumps per limb). Anywhooo, I applied without issues. An hour into processing my skin hadn’t changed at all so I was feeling a little defeated, but after going to bed and waking up I’m suddenly vacation tanned. It looks like I’ve gone to Florida for a couple weeks! The application was seamless, my skin feels great. Only reason it lost a star was because it is a tad bit on the orange side. Beware of the tips of your fingers, your nose and the tops of your ankle where it meets your shin (if that makes sense???), those areas came out a bit darker but otherwise are totally fine. I’d recommend this. It’s an easy application, seamless tan, sunkissed finish.Updated: lost another star because it does, in fact, stain. I lost an entire white shirt and it stained my satin pillow case too. So it’s definitely not transfer resistant like it claims.

Reviewed in Canada on April 10, 2024Verified Purchase
I bought this after I saw Tik Tok reviews. I followed the instructions from TY that said to do your ""everything"" bath or shower,  including exfoliation. After, moisturize everywhere, and ensure good coverage on elbows, knees, feet, nails, and wrists.I found it was a stunning brown colour, even, no streaks and lasted the full 5 days.Bought the mitt for the second application and it is even better! 👌 love this

I was so excited to try this new self tanner . I prepped as recommended, added lotion to feet, elbows, knees, hands . I used a mit for the application. Allowed to dry down as I normally would (this isn't my first time using a self tanner) . I woke up today and am honestly in SHOCK at how uneven and ORANGE this tan is. My hands are absolutely embarrassing to look at. My chest dosent look any darker but my hands , omg my hands ! Its unbelievable. Zero starts out of five.Don't always trust viral products, this is proof!

I love this product as it goes on clear, has a nice odour, dries quickly and creates a natural looking tan. It also is quite economical as it comes in a big bottle. You will not regret purchasing this!

Excellent Customer Service, plus wow trans-friendly 😀
Reviewed in Canada on April 17, 2023Verified Purchase
When I first purchased this, I had been using a prevous generation battery-powered Satisfyer and was going through a ridiculous amount of batteries. Unfortunately, right out of the box this ine seemed to have very little suction.I considered chalking it up as a life lesson, but the 15-year warranty surprised me. I mean, nobody takes returns on any kind of toy like this (and I'm glad they don't!!), so I went ahead and contacted the seller.I wanted to let folks know the 15-year warranty is a real thing. The folks in customer service were fantastic, polite and friendly and extremely apologetic it didn't work! Their reported failure rate is less than 1% of these, but they sell so MANY (especially during the lockdowns, heh) that the 1-star reviews paint a very different picture. As people are more likely to post a negative review than a positive (I mean, if it works as expected, it just did its job, right?), and the numbers really are pretty skewed.I don't mean that the 1-star reviews are not real, they absolutely are! It sucks (or well, doesn't) when you spend money on something that doesn't work, and quite frankly is an embarrassing/taboo enough item most people are unlikely to contact the sellers about it.EIS is the manufacturer of Satisfyer, not just a reseller, so they absolutely know what's up and stand behind their products. I received not just an immediate refund, but also a replacement which was much more to my expectations. The customer service people I exchanged emails with were respectful, friendly, but definitely let you set the tone so they don't come off creepy or overshare-y. I didn't have to send pictures or answer questions, the refund came first, then the suggested troubleshooting because I had specifically asked for it.Customer Service is what happens when things go wrong. I'm honestly glad this happened, or I wouldn't have thought to chat with the people who make these cool products and who are very big on everyone having a great time, no matter what their body happens to be like.Additionally, the staff are extremely trans and non-binary friendly and answered questions for things that don't get posted on the site, like full dimensions of the openings, and have suggestions for other products in the line that have different shapes and sizes. I actually found out they sell different replacable head types, which was perfect for me! I've been on Testosterone for 3+ years now and my body is in a place where a lot of products I used to like (like rabbit-style vibrators) just don't work with my anatomy anymore, but neither do ones tailored for men's anatomy. I would have been grateful if there were just one or two options, as the way this works doesn't cause me any body dysphoria (just euphoria!), but folks were determined to make sure I had as many options as possible to work with and better information than I could get anywhere short of taking them out of the box in a store. Which is generally frowned-upon.(Stag Shops and Come As You Are in TO have a wall of unboxed demo units for exactly this reason, which is brilliant. Both sell this brand and are awesome companies. Everybody gets gold stars all around!)So the 15-year warranty is really a thing! They're discreet, very understanding, and absolutely will not make you feel embarrassed or small for being disappointed if things aren't knocking your socks off. They want you to feel great, and if that's not happening then they want to fix that however works best for you.If I wasn't just a fan from the products themselves -- and the advertising, omg -- I would be 100% sold for life based on their customer service.

Great for Solo time
Reviewed in Canada on May 14, 2020Verified Purchase
Provides suction, which is different from vibration, and is pretty easy to use. You will get the hang of positioning it as you experiment. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is also easy to use elsewhere (ie. just above the clit or on the nipples, if you are sensitive). The charger is this weird magnetic attachment which is awesome for the waterproof aspect but does not stay on if not laid to rest so cannot be used while charging (found that out mid session). Nice addition to the toy box.

It rusted after one use in water and is now unusable
Reviewed in Canada on January 2, 2021Verified Purchase
Once I received it, I charged it according to instructions. After that was done, I placed it in water to wash it and it immediately started to fill with water. I could see bubbles of air escaping as it was filling. But once I took it out of the water, the water inside refused to drain out. It's like there was nowhere for it to come out. You could hear and feel water sloshing inside, but even turning it this way and that to try to find a spot to drain, barely anything would come out. The only way was holding it straight up, and it would drip around the magnets for the charger. Only one drop at a time. It took forever, so I ended up propping it standing on a pile of tissue paper and I would come back occasionnaly to change the tissues and check if it was empty. I kid you not, it took more than a day. By the end, I would need to give it a good shake and the water that would still come out had a brown tinge to it. When I dabbed at the magnets, you could clearly see that it's rust (see photo). Now it won't turn on, and when I try to charge it, the blinking light that was on the first time isn't even on. My guess is that the thing is rusted through on the inside. At this price, I expected something that would be  more than a single-use object.

Hitachi Magic Wand vs. Satisfyer 2
Reviewed in Canada on December 12, 2021Verified Purchase
I've been a diehard Hitachi Magic Wand fan since it gave me my first orgasm in my 20s. However, the Hitachi is not very roommate friendly. I was looking for a quieter alternative and I came across the Satisfyer 2. Here are some of the pros and cons.Pros:- I was surprised that the Satisfyer 2 actually did make me come. In the past, I've only been able to orgasm with the Magic Wand.- It is also much smaller, so it's definitely a better travel sized option.- Is it quieter? That depends.... I found myself having to adjust it alot to find a good spot; everytime you remove or reposition it, it makes a loud suction noise. But if you're sensitive down there and find a good position right away, then yes it is quieter than the Magic Wand. But it does get pretty loud at the higher speeds / vibration settings.Cons:- You have to charge it. Which is not really discrete if you live with other people. Also I had it die on me right before I was about to come and I FELT BETRAYED!- Takes longer to orgasm compared to the Magic Wand and the orgasm is less intense.- More of a clean up. Requires lube to work most effectively. Which means you got to wash it after, and you run the risk of getting lube all over your bedding- Direct contact. I don't like having to directly touch my clit with a weird suction tool and also having to find the best position for it. What I like about the Magic Wand is that I usually can use it with pants on or a couple layers of underwear. No need for lube, direct contact or adjustment. Just hold for 15-20 seconds and then BAM you're done.So in conclusion, the Satisfyer 2 is a good alternative. Might use it for travel, but I'll take the Hitachi over the Satisfyer 2 anyday!Happy masturbating everyone!

So the top when the pop-o-matic dice is, is open, there's no plastic window there on the box, so I guess it fell out of the box while either being picked or packed. Anyways game still works well.

Awesome Squish with Weight but Can't Choose Colour
Reviewed in Canada on December 12, 2023Verified Purchase
I absolutely love this squish toy and it's incredibly durable and stretchy compared to my usual sugar balls that have a raised bump on it that I tend to pick at until it breaks.It also isn't super soft either, it's not so easy to just squish a done. The texture is more of really thick hot glue that has been cooled and just solidifying (don't ask how I know lol), but it will go back to it's original shape slowly.It really does live up to the hype honestly.I would not recommend this if you or if you have a kiddo who has an oral sensory need as I feel that it would break if chewed on.

the best portable console i've ever owned!
Reviewed in Canada on June 6, 2015Verified Purchase
i've been a huge nintendo fan for years and this is honestly such a revolutionary console.it's portable gaming with better-than-ever internet support, a huge online-friendly roster of games, eshop to download not only add-on software but entire games digitally, precise controls, sleek design that feels comfortable to hold, AND features not previously included on the original 3DS (built-in NFC amiibo support, c stick, Z shoulder buttons, better battery life, rearranged buttons for easier access to certain controls, micro SD card support, etc). truly the very best portable console on the market and i would highly recommend it for anyone considering getting a 3DS family system. it's a bit more expensive than the original 3DS XL, but the extra money is absolutely worth it for all of the improvements and added content.my system arrived on time and in perfect condition. i was a bit disappointed that the package doesnt come with a charger, but this shouldn't be much of a problem if you had previously owned a DSi or 3DS (the chargers are the same). you can also get generic chargers for these systems for around $15.as far as data transfer from previous consoles goes: because my first 3DS didn't have much data on it, transferring the data wirelessly from my old SD card to the micro SD card only took about a half hour, but i've heard that this can be tricker and more labor intensive for those with lots of data on the previous console (it may require unscrewing the back plate of the console to physically remove the micro SD card, plugging the card into a PC that has micro SD support, and dragging the files manually).overall, this is a 5-star system and i definitely recommend it to nintendo fans of all ages and experiences!

I've been holding back on buying a 3DS ever since it came out and I fancied it as a nice birthday present to myself, so I decided to pull the trigger.I had borrowed 3DSes a handful of times in the past from my more altruistic friends, but I'm very grateful to have splurged on the XL--It makes the vanilla 3DS seem borderline barbaric by comparison.I've seen reports of the AC Adapter being missing from this package, requiring a separate purchase. Though I disapprove of this  omission not being more clearly advertised, it seems fortune favored me this day, as my package included one.Bottom line, if you're in the market for a 3DS, you'd do yourself a disservice by not going for the XL. It makes the 3DS experience really pop--In more ways than one.

at this price it a very good buy (the full retail price is to much
Reviewed in Canada on January 12, 2016Verified Purchase
I bought this for my son birthday in the boxing day on amazon.ca at 189.99 $, at this price it a very good buy (the full retail price is to much, wait for a good deal). Everything you expect for a nintendo system is here: very good exclusive title and third party title, retro compatibility with all 'DS and 3ds' game (big library of game), excellent gameplay, good battery life (depending of your setting), responsive touchcreen, now very good 3d effect, good graphic (the vita is better on that department), easy to ugrade memory (micro sd card) and battery. This new 3ds is what should be the 3ds when console was laucnh couple a years ago. And now new game will be built for that new console so to me if your are a new customer who never bought a 3ds buy this one, for someone who already have the older system is maybe the time for a upgrade. My only criticism will be to not include a cable or a AC adapter to charge this thing, is not acceptable even if you already own the previous model (all ds and 3ds charger is compatible for the new 3ds and was include with the older model). At least give the option to buy a model with the charger and another model without. So 4 Star for a product close to the perfection, if we exlude the greed of nintendo for not including a charger this will be a 5 star.

and the XL screen size is easy and relaxing to look at
Reviewed in Canada on December 1, 2017Verified Purchase
The ""Super Stable 3D"" works fantastically, I never have to force my eyes or head position in order to get it to work, and the XL screen size is easy and relaxing to look at. Glad to have skipped the original 3DS and its very finicky narrow 3D view.I rarely ever turn off the 3D or get any headaches. Though, I find that like with watching 3D movies, after awhile you stop noticing and paying attention to the 3D effect, unless something intentionally juts ""out of the screen"" to get your attention. That's a compliment to how seamlessly the ""Super Stable 3D"" augments the 3DS experience, but at the same time is a commentary to how superfluous 3D in general is to movies and games.Still, this is the best handheld I have ever used by Nintendo outside of the home/handheld hybrid console Switch.

Reviewed in Canada on February 24, 2024Colour Name: 1 Frosted Black+7Flavor PodsVerified Purchase
this product was popular on Tiktok for its ability to change the way water tasted in the bottle because of the circular scents that you put on the water bottle. You're supposed to smell the scent while you drink, then it makes the water taste like the scent, but i was very disappointed when i payed this much money for it, and it doesn't work. The scents smell good and all, but it acts more as an air freshener than a additive to water. Do not recommend buying

I was the happy owner of a Kobo Aura One for a bit more than five years and very happy with the product.  It did, unfortunately, cease to function towards the end of year five .  I believe it was the battery as I couldn't get it to charge, even though I purchased a new charging cord.  The e-reader provided many, many hours of reading enjoyment and was definitely worth the initial cost of ownership.  I immediately decided that I had to purchase another e-reader.  After a bit of research I felt that the Libra 2 would be a good fit for me.  I was amazed at how quickly I was able to get reading again.  It was incredible to me that my previously purchased books had automatically been transferred to the new e-reader.  The Libra is very easy to navigate and I was up and running in no time.This has been one of my best and most valued purchases this past year.

Great eBook (but w/ one exception)…
Reviewed in Canada on November 11, 2023Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Originally, I chose the Kobo because my local library offers a tremendous range of  e- and audiobooks. They support Kobo and not other platforms. I also chose a Kobo because it’s apparently Canadian in origin. Additionally I was excited to begin journaling and note-taking with.The build quality is superb: it feels solid and and the incorporated case is attractive and functional with its in-built stand and useful strap for one-handed holding. Excellent view-ability from sunlight to pitch black bedroom conditions.My alluded to concern was with its suggested (by Kobo itself) inability to take advantage of the company’s own Kobo Stylo. I was quite disappointed about this until I found myself idling in the aisles of a dollar store (“Dollar Tree”) and spotted a fabulous stylo with four different functions: the requisite silicon tip for use on “all touch surfaces,” a ballpoint pen that peeks out at the twist of the cap; and the addition of two tiny and unobtrusive chrome buttons that activate a flashlight function and a piercing red laser suitable for presentations. AND instead of shelling out close to $90 for the incompatible Kobo stylo, this little gem of a stylo cost an extraordinary price of $1.50!!!Needless to say, this stylo was a steal and it helped establish my choice of the Libra 2 as a fine choice indeed.

Bought this to compare to Kindle
Reviewed in Canada on December 29, 2022Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Where should I start.  I prefer this to the Kindle, but then the Kindle Paperwhite (PW) is just that bit easier on the eyes.The Kobo Libra 2 handles almost any file type, Kindle PW only MOBI.  Easy enough to convert a file or so, BUT I also don't like the file management scheme from Amazon. Buying an eBook on Amazon is easy enough, and voila it just appears on the Kindle PW, BUT you need to be internet connect to read those.  Minor annoyances.The battery life is good, days of reading before I need to recharge, and it charges rapidly.  BUT is does not like recharges from a portable battery charger at all. It will drain the thing and only have a bout 1/3 power.  Same device on the Kindle PW, the Kindle PW fully charges up leaving the portable battery with a little juice left.However, I like the page buttons on this better than tapping on the PW. I tend to jump pages on the PW sometimes, and the buttons prevent this.I like the page size on the PW a bit better, and as I noted the screen is easier on my eyes. The pages are a bit wider on the Kobo Libra 2, so its not easy to compare them from one device to the other.It's got no real drawbacks even compared to the Kindle PW, and I find the pluses of file type support, ease of file management, and the page buttons better and more useful features. If I had to choose, I would go with the Kobo Libra 2.

I recently tried the Karseell Collagen Hair Treatment, and I'm blown away by the results! First off, the scent is absolutely divine—it smells so good, like a luxurious spa experience in a jar. After using it for the recommended time, my hair felt incredibly soft, silky, and rejuvenated. What's even more impressive is that I decided to leave it on overnight for some extra TLC, and the results were phenomenal. My hair looked and felt amazing the next morning, with a noticeable improvement in its texture and shine.One of the things that drew me to this product is its commitment to natural ingredients and being free of sulfates and parabens. It's reassuring to know that I'm nourishing my hair with high-quality, botanical-based ingredients from around the world. The Karseell Collagen Hair Treatment is suitable for all hair types, including frizzy, dry, curly, and damaged hair, making it versatile for anyone looking to revitalize their locks.I appreciate the brand's dedication to professional-grade products, whether for at-home use, travel, or salon treatments. The deep repair formula truly works wonders, delivering nourishment from root to tip, and leaving my hair hydrated, smooth, and full of luster. If you're looking for a hair mask that delivers salon-quality results in the comfort of your own home, I highly recommend giving Karseell Collagen Hair Treatment a try. You won't be disappointed!

The hair mask was really effective. I’m in need of a haircut soon so my ends are a little dry and a little rough with some small split ends. Using this once I noticed a softness that I haven’t achieved with other products. The instructions say to use two times a week which I will do until the container is empty. I will likely buy this product again. Some others have said the scent is strong, I believe it is a strong scent but I like it overall. One thing for certain, once you put it on your hair, it’s on for a good while. Rinsing it out is longer than your average conditioner and ensure that you rinse the tub to make sure you don’t slip. It’s a little slippery as most products are. Other than that, I believe that a lot of people will enjoy the product. I have wavy hair and it’s thick. I’d imagine those with finer hair may not need to use this product because it will feel heavy and may be too much. However, if your hair is damaged, I recommend.

I absolutely LOVE this product.  I bought it because I saw a video....on IG.... and I've had such dry hair for a long time.  I thought...why not... I've spent so much money on other products (that haven't worked)...so I took a chance.  Man, I'm happy I did take that chance.  I have thick, dry hair. I've been using this for a month now and love it and I've seen a huge difference in my hair...1-being softer and 2-shinier.  The smell...OMG!...the smell is wonderful!  I wash my hair 1x - 2x per week and use only this conditioner.  After I apply the conditioner, I run my hands through my hair, then use a hair clip to pin my hair up (my hair is almost to the middle of my back).  Let it sit for awhile.  When I rinse my hair, i rinse it with my head upside-down, while holding my ends out of the water....so I'm rinsing my scalp really good.  I will be definitely buying more of this! I totally recommend this product.

Sound quality for the person on the other end of the phone is awful.First review below from February belowThe product performs reasonably well but has its limitations.  I expected more from a product in this price range.Peering: It peers successfully with both laptop and phone simultaneously and does it very well.Listening Range: Have been able to wander away from the laptop and phone to a far distance, even to other floor and still hear the person on the other end.Talking Range: This is very different from the listening range.  It is much shorter.  It is also very inconsistent.  You can be 10 feet away and all is fine, then quality on the other end drops.  Only solution is to be right beside the laptop or phone.  Not being line of site also seems to impact the quality.  This is the most concerning limitation of this equipment.Battery: Reasonable.  It charges pretty quickly and six hours at 1/2 volume is pretty consistently achieved.Size: nice and small.Comfort: Very comfortable to wear over the ear.Volume Up and Down Buttons on the headset:  Not really useful.  Very awkward spot and stiff.  Adjusting while on the ear isn't something easily done.Overall the product is reasonable but overpriced because of the Talking Range limitation.  There are much cheaper single ear headsets with much better range but in a different form factor.

Great Noise cancellation, but average output audio
Reviewed in Canada on February 11, 2023Style: SingleVerified Purchase
I bought this product as I was tired of the complaints from my loved ones about not being able to hear me well while using my phone or earbuds. This earpiece noise cancellation is fantastic and has considerably improved the quality of my calls. My only complaint is that its output audio could be better. Also, I recommend turning off the device when not using it, as the battery lasts only 6 hrs.

Best over the ear Bluetooth for truckers ever
Reviewed in Canada on September 20, 2023Style: SingleVerified Purchase
This is hands down the best over the ear Bluetooth I’ve ever purchased. It’s the only one that people can hear me on when I’m driving my truck at work. It’s my second one the first one lasted over 4 years with lots of drops it had a hard life. I truly recommend this to any truck driver that prefers over the ear headsets instead of over the head type.The battery life could be a bit better but I’ll take better sound quality and the best noise cancelling out there over a longer lasting battery though.

Reviewed in Canada on July 20, 2023Style: SingleVerified Purchase
I have owned 4 or 5 of these products over my lifetime, and I've yet to find a product that compares into terms of noise cancellation.  The challenge with this product is durability.  It will break or stop functioning correctly if you drop it.  Even though nothing seems to be broken in the headset, or any loose parts, the mic quality completely disappears.

This collection is a wonderful holiday treat
Reviewed in Canada on January 15, 2017Verified Purchase
This collection is a wonderful holiday treat, especially to those children who've read the book (included) and/or have seen the video presentation on TV. The little elf (included) is an exact likeness of ""Chippy"" from that TV presentation and its fun to watch the family decide what name to give your new ""elf"". You can then go the website & register your new elf's name. While some parents have found that your new elf's present at various high up spots around the room where the Christmas tree is displayed helps with discipline, most have found that moving him around after the little ones are fast asleep is quickly noticed the next morning with the knowledge that the elf has indeed gone back to talk to Santa during the night. It's all fun & definitely will become an annual tradition that the children will cherish even after they grow up. I highly recommend this version to all families with young children not only for the quality of the elf but also for the large story book that's included with easy to read words and pictures. A wonderful collectible holiday treasure your family can enjoy year after year.

My grandson asked for the elf last year but we didn't really listen to him and didn't know much about the elf. Well a year later we were a little more knowledgeable. He asked me if I would get him one for Christmas. i explained that Christmas would be too late as the elf goes back with Santa on Christmas eve. But I did get him one for his birthday on Dec. 20th and he was thrilled. The elf immediately was named and took his place of pride on the mantle. Each day he was searched for, letters were written to him, his suggestions followed and much discussion centered around the elf. Although he only had him for 5 days he was well worth the money as my grandson enjoyed him immensely.

A Good Tablet For The Money
Reviewed in Canada on April 5, 2024Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBConfiguration: Standalone Fire HD 8Colour Name: BlackStyle: Fire HD 8Verified Purchase
I just bought this Fire Tablet HD 8 12th generation on sale at a great price to replace my 2 year old Fire HD 8 10th gen model. Previously to buying into Fire, I've owned a string of iPads but for the price, I really can't fault these Fire tablets at all. I use it primarily for reading ePubs, streaming music, email and a bit of social media. It ticks all these boxes at a very reasonable price. I'm not noticing much difference in overall performance with the 12th gen over the 10th gen but at this price point and the 5 equal payments option, I couldn't resist. The setup with this new model was seamless and quickly restored all the settings from backups of my older model. With a simple install of play store, I was good to go. I bought the 32GB model and simply boosted storage with an inexpensive Micro SD card. The Fire HD 8 (12th Gen) meets my requirements.

Reviewed in Canada on May 10, 2023Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBConfiguration: Standalone Fire HD 8Colour Name: DenimStyle: Fire HD 8Verified Purchase
I am going to preface this with the following. I have a Android Tablet and an iPad.I purchased this device for 1 and 1 reason only. To listen to Audiable.As an Android tablet, it is inoffensive. The buttons are not placed in a way I'd like making the top of the tablet very busy. But with the addition of a USB-C port and a headphone port more than makes up for it.From a ""official"" software experience wise, if you just want a device to entertain your kids with. Disney Plus, some books and Netflix. Then it's a cheap and ""safe"" buy, if you are OK giving Amazon your usage data.However the minute you try to use anything outside of Amazon's ""ecosystem"" it turns into a nightmare. Wanna read a Kobo Book or listen to a Audiobook from Google Play? Good Luck sideloading everything, or being force to use the browser to get some functionality.What's worse is that if you live in Canada, Audiable can't be found anywhere and refuses to install even if you figure out how to side load.However after too much time here is my steps to get this device... mostly usable.1) Install a F-Droid Client, (droid-ify my go-to), here you can install third party launchers (important for later), third party browsers, ePub readers for DRM-free books (KOReader FTW), and more if you so desire.2) On you F-Droid app, download Aurora Store. A open source Google Play client which makes side loading offical apps easy. You may want to sign in to the app with a Google Account if you want to search on it.3) On Aurora Store you can download pretty much anything else you needs (and keep it up to date), from Kobo, and Libby. Sadly Google Play books won't work since you are missing Google Play's frameworks, but with Adobe Digital Editions and VLC you can download and read Google Play books from the downloaded acm files from Google Play, and audio books can downloaded directly to your device.4) Now remember how I said that Audable doesn't work on the Fire Tablet, despite saying that it's the reason I got it. Well with a third party Launcher like Lawn Chair, you can see all the pre-installed apps Amazon didn't want Canadians to play with... including Audable.Now with all this said if you want to keep the device upto date, then you can't change the default launcher (-1 star), and the fact that amazon's own services are knee-caped which makes even the unbranded tablets look like a better deal (-1 star). It makes it hard to recommend.However it's easy to setup, and it comes from a reputable (both good and bad) company. So please do with this as you will.

Whether blocking a city's growth or connecting with your opponent's road to share the points, Carcassonne provides plenty of ways to use your cunning and outsmart your opponents.    ONE STEP AT A TIME TILE-PLACEMENT GAME: Players fill in the countryside around the medieval fortified city, choosing from tiles that depict cities, roads, monasteries, and fields    each new tile creates an ever-expanding board on which players can then add their followers.    JACK OF ALL TRADES: Followers can take many different roles (knights, monks, farmers, or thieves) determined by the type of tile on which they're placed. Each role scores points differently, so you'll need careful planning to make the best use of your followers.    HOW TO ACHIEVE VICTORY: Players score points by having followers on tiles as features are completed. The player who makes the most strategic placements of tiles and followers will score the most points and win the game.    HIGH REPLAYABILITY: With its simple yet rich game mechanics and eighty-four tiles that can be configured into numerous combinations, Carcassonne appeals to beginners and veteran gamers alike. LOOKING FOR NEW ADVENTURES? Try our many expansions (Note: Expansions require Carcassonne Base Game to play). Average Playtime: 45 minutes.

Reviewed in Canada on January 7, 2024Verified Purchase
This was easy to learn and fun to play. The half hour game play means we often can play more than one round. If you’re looking for a complex competitive game like Settlers of Catan, this probably isn’t what you’re looking for. But it’s fantastic if you want a game that works well for all ages. We like that there are several variations included.My only complaint is that the rules had some minor discrepancies and were missing a few details. We had to make up some of our own rules to compensate.

Sound quality is excellent, and it stays firmly plugged into both my phone and headphone cable. You get what you pay for, and in this case this is a good thing!

Reviewed in Canada on May 27, 2023Verified Purchase
Exactly what my review title saysI don't exactly remember what Anker products I've had in the past. But they've all been reliable.So I'm sure this one's going to be reliable too.I'm using this adapter with my Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G. So far so good. The fact there's no compromise in sound quality, after playing an hour on varied mobile games; is a good sign to me(Honestly though, the whole ""art"" of finding functional adapters for...anything; tends to be a real challenge depending on what kind of adapter it is. So glad I scored on this one)Anyhow, I'll certainly revamp and update this review into a better one later on, if I feel generous with spare time. If things go WRONG with this adapter, I'll certainly update this review to reflect that also. I will probably add pix later on tooFor now, as things are, I'm SUPER happy. :D :D :D :D[ Let's hope one of these days, Anker makes a PERFECT USB-C  mini hub that could use a 3.5mm headset PLUS take in another USB-C :D :D :D  ( I know it's a challenge)  ]

Read before buying if you don't live in U.S
Reviewed in Canada on June 25, 2021Verified Purchase
If you're purchasing this from outside the U.S, the ""final price"" at purchase isn't the final price because the taxes and shipping fee hasn't been applied yet (it will do so once shipped, and then you'll see the charges in your bank account). This is not the company's fault, and it is something Amazon should make clear to their customers. At first I was upset at the seller due to my misunderstanding, but after communicating with them, they did their best to make sure I wasn't dissatisfied with the transaction. Before leaving a negative review, message the seller and I'm sure they'll try to help you out, especially if you're unsure about some of the details in their advertisement.The seller delivers on promise on what the phone comes with (although a nitpick, the battery was not near 80 percent). The screen has a noticeable scratch, which was to be expected. The delivery was quick and came next day. Mine came with freebies such as a screen protector and phone case. This product is worth the money, in my opinion.

I wasn't too sure about buying this, but I figured I'd take a chance. I'm glad I did. Maybe I lucked out, but the phone I received had zero damage whatsoever. No scratches at all, in fact it looks brand new. I was a bit concerned about the Battery after reading other reviews but  I worried for nothing. When my phone arrived it was at 20% charged. Once I charged it, I was getting 100% battery charge, and I still am.If you're using an Android, as I was, I suggest using the App, ""Move to IOS"" if you want to Transfer everything from your Android to the iPhone. It only took a few minutes (Possibly longer if you have a lot of Photos or Music to transfer)I've also updated to the latest IOS 16 with no trouble at all.Great phone at a great price.Of course, like I said, maybe I lucked out, but I'm thrilled with my purchase.

Best bang for you buck. Only face product worth having IMO
Reviewed in Canada on November 30, 2022Size: 375 g (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I can't believe how hard it is to find this item. It's not carried in any store where I live and so many buyers on Amazon want a ridiculous amount of money for even smaller containers! This one is a reasonable price for the size. A LARGE container (375g) with A SINGLE ingredient (Petrolatum).I was using a different Vaseline brand lotion prior to purchasing this (""advanced healing repair moisture"" ... what a joke) and my skin would still crack/flake after only a couple hours.My skin is oily around my nose and very dry along my temples & cheeks. I am also prone to acne breakout, especially along my jawline. I wash my face with only water (first warm then rinse with cold) and then I apply this Vaseline product on my entire face and it stays supple, soft, and moisturized all day long (the oily & dry parts of my face feel and look the exact same now too!). My acne has also almost completely gone along my jawline.(note: I don't use any other face cleaning products or apply any makeup afterward. If you do use makeup, I would think you'd need to wait a few minutes before putting it on. After applying the Vaseline my face feels a bit ""sticky' for maybe 10 minutes or so. But after it dries/absorbs the product, my skin is evenly soft and feels fantastic.)I highly recommend this particular Vaseline product.The only ""downside"" is the jar is quite large and not ideal for travelling, but it's an easy fix: scoop some out into a smaller container and take that with you. There's no need to pay $8+ for a puny little 50ml (why is it in ml and not grams anyway??) container when you can get this 375g for only $5 (CAD).

Received PS3 really quickly. It works fine so far. Clean, like new almost. Online games I have downloaded and discs work in it. Controller in great condition and so far works with no issues. Didn’t use any of the plugs that came with as I was replacing a busted PS3 with working cables. But they did look functional. Very happy with my purchase.

I’m not sure if it’s broken or needs a new battery, either way, they were selling with controller and saying nothing about its working condition. I ended up with a system that just sat there until I bought a controller from another seller.These batteries are not easy to replace and of a very specific type.Do not buy here

One of my favourite systems.
Reviewed in Canada on September 22, 2022Verified Purchase
I previously had own a PS3 slim and it was one of my favourite owned consoles. There are so many classics such as the Uncharted series, Heavy Rain, Little Big Planet, and Batman Arkham series. The controllers were a big upgrade over the PS2. It was also the first Sony console to have 1080 supported.  People don't remember that the first generation PS3s were sold at prices higher than the PS5s.I bought a used PS3 to play the games I still have on my PSN account. The condition was described as very good. However, the controller and system had significant damages to it. I was pretty disappointed and ended up returning it. I will try again if I see one on Amazon for a good price.

Bought a used console from EverydayDealsCanada in “Very Good” condition. Completely accurate description, the unit came cleaned up, and complete with a (Red, score!) controller and all the cords that you would find in the box as if it were new. The HDMI plug on the back of the unit is slightly wonky, but works. Overall, if works just fine and I can play the games that I enjoyed before online play became overbearing.

I wanted to use this product for a week before writing a review. I purchased the cleanser, eye cream, and am and pm moisturizer. I was hesitant at first from all the bad reviews I read. Every product I’ve used before has really dried out my skin and made it worse. However, these products have been amazing, especially the under eye cream. No bad reactions and noticeable results in just one week. Every skin type is different however Cerave has been amazing for me and I highly recommend it.

The optimal mouse in a competitive market
Reviewed in Canada on November 10, 2019Style: G Pro MousePattern Name: Mouse onlyVerified Purchase
Let me preface my review by saying I have gone through many mice before arriving at this one, and that I am an FPS player, so that will affect my preferences in a mouse.With that said, I don't think there is a mouse on the market better all-around than this one. There are some things some mice may boast over this, such as more side buttons, but everything other mice may have is for other uses. This is for the FPS gamer, and there is nothing more to want.The features are simple, but everything you need. The side mouse buttons are interchangeable so you can have them on the left or right, or both. This compliments the ambidextrous design well, and the option of having both could be useful for FPS games with many abilities (though I have not tried this yet).The weight is nothing short of amazing for a wireless gaming mouse. On the topic of wireless, I have had issues with previous wireless gaming mice (specifically the Razer Mamba), but none at all with this. I had no problems with my Logitech G305 either; Logitech's wireless is some of the best on the peripheral market. The battery life is even more impressive than the weight, able to last me around a week straight of constant use all day with a single charge. This is largely thanks to Logitech's Hero sensor, which is likely the best on the market right now, basically being a more efficient 3360.The appearance may be a bit on the plain side compared to it's latest rival: the Razer Viper, but it has a safe and comfortable shape, with buttons separate from the rest of the shell for better response and longevity. Admittedly the dpi button being on the underside of the mouse does make it impossible to make on-the-fly dpi adjustments, though that is very niche, and the button being out of the way may be a bonus to some.To sum up: the connection has, just like all Logitech mice, had no issues whatsoever. The weight is amazingly low even for a wired mouse. The buttons are perfect for FPS or casual use. The shape is plain, but safe and comfortable, and the battery life is superb with it's industry-leading Hero sensor. The market will catch up eventually, but I think this will be simply the optimal mouse (outside of moba games) for the foreseeable future.

Premium mouse with some misses
Reviewed in Canada on December 4, 2022Colour Name: Classic BlackSize: Mouse + DockStyle: Viper Ultimate - WirelessPattern Name: Mouse + DockVerified Purchase
Bought at $100-ish on sale and used for work, web browsing and gaming for few days.Pros:+ This mouse feels amazing in your hand! The build quality is quite high as well and the design of the mouse is very nice.+ The mouse is also surprisingly light. For a wireless design you would expect a battery weight penalty but it doesn't seem to affect this model.As this is my first Razer mouse I have to say it left such a good impression I'd consider getting another mouse from them in the future.Cons:- The scroll-wheel .... yep, it's harder to roll the wheel due to increased resistance. This might not affect you as much in game as it may even prevent accidental weapon cycling, but for web and work this increased resistance on the wheel will become tiring.- The back/forward buttons on the side of the mouse conform with the shape of the mouse almost perfectly making them harder to detect with your thumb and harder to press too. It felt like I had to mash my thumb over the general area to activate the button. They would benefit greatly from a little catch lip or dot and different angle to make them easier to detect and press for sausage fingers like mine.Extra:~ RGB is underwhelming  (but you can see that in the pictures) due to having only the 1 area on the palm that lights up you will not have any visible light while the mouse is under your hand.~ Most mice out there uses a button on the top next to the mouse wheel to change the DPI on the fly, however this model places it on the bottom making it impossible to change rapidly unless you reprogram another button. Not a big deal for me and you can observe this in the pictures as well.Mouse mat warning: This mouse is as smooth as butter in a hot pan while using directly on desk and tracks accurately too. I think this model performs better on a smooth, hard surface. That being sais as I have to use a mouse mat for ergonomic reasons I felt the feet of the mouse catch and resist movement on my traditional, soft mat. I strongly suggest you to use it on a hard surface if you can.

 I recently purchased the Revlon RVDR5222F One-Step Volumizer and Ionic Hair Dryer to streamline my hair styling routine.The brush is lightweight and easy to handle, with a comfortable grip for extended use. The inclusion of advanced ionic technology ensures less frizz and smoother hair, which is perfect for my thick, unruly locks.Some users may find the brush size too large for shorter hair lengthsOverall, I highly recommend the Revlon RVDR5222F One-Step Volumizer and Ionic Hair Dryer to anyone looking to simplify their hair styling routine.

So convenient
Reviewed in Canada on April 7, 2024Colour Name: BlackPattern Name: Hair Dryer & VolumizerVerified Purchase
I have fine curly hair. As a curly girly, my curly hair routine leaves my arms and neck sore because it’s a whole workout lol. So on some days I dread doing the routine and just wanna straighten my hair because it’s easier to manage and stays longer and I feel more presentable with 0 refreshes. This thing is so so good and so easy to use. I was convinced by a tiktok (Ashley) to get it and no regrets. Saves me SO much time and is so easy to use. Doesn’t shed/break my hair a lot, just a few strands which is normal when applying heat or brushing on the daily. I use this once a week on my lazy days and it also seems to make my hair shiny. It makes my hair so soft and silky smooth, i love it! Only downside is that it’s very big and kinda heavy so my arms do get tired and i find myseld taking short breaks.

Great product for me
Reviewed in Canada on January 16, 2024Colour Name: BlackPattern Name: Hair Dryer & VolumizerVerified Purchase
This for me has been amazing, before I was drying my hair with a straight brush, round brush & it took quite awhile. When I seen this I figured ok I'll give it a try & I'm very happy I did, my hair is not too thick so I haven't had to deal with my hair getting tangled up in it (as maybe that can happen for very thick hair? I don't really know).It's not too heavy & easy to use.I've been using it now for over 6 months & the bristles are all still intact, it doesn't show any wear & tear on it at all.You can style your hair with this & really look like you've walked out of the salon. It's been a game changer as it styles my hair perfectly & it is really saves me a whole lot of time.

I am writing this review from the point of view of my specific hair.  I have long, straight and fine hair although a fair amount.  I purchased this thinking it would dry my hair, add some volume and maybe add some curl.  It did none of these for my hair.  This product is not a hair dryer, rather a styling aid.  The barrel is large so not useful for short hair, as well it is rather heavy if you have any issues with your arms or hands.  I did not have increased volume or curl.  It did smooth my hair, not something I really wanted.  This product would be really useful for someone that wants to straighten their hair, in that case I would give it a 4 star.  Remember, this gets really hot so not a hair dryer without damage to your hair

I bought this to give my heat-friendly synthetic wigs a quick run-through after wearing and it's incredible. It leaves them so smooth and soft (at least until I wear them again haha). It's so much easier, quicker, and seemingly more effective than using a flat iron, and I can get a nice curve at the ends that gives my wigs a little more body. Can't say enough how much I love this thing.

Reviewed in Canada on May 14, 2022Verified Purchase
January 2022 was the first time in my life I had acne and it took me some time to get to know its type. It was fungal acne and with some research on the internet, I found Nizoral shampoo. I used it continuously from February up until March-end. It definitely worked wonders and reduced fungal acne big time but new acnes were still coming every now and then. Again some research on the internet helped me discover De La Cruz's 10% Sulfur Ointment and after a lot of contemplation (as I don't like to use many products on my skin, it's sensitive), I ordered this. It has been close to a week using this and I have observed a significant improvement in my skin. No new acne has appeared so far. It does dry the skin so I have refrained from using it all over my face, instead, I apply it on the acne head.

Don’t let faint likes discourage you
Reviewed in Canada on February 19, 2024Size: 70 count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
First the LH strips- they will always be positive, that’s normal. Medium to light colour leading up to and after ovulation. However you will notice a huge difference in the colour strip when you have your LH surge, you won’t question it because the line will be darker then the other test line and then this means you’re going to ovulate within 12-36 hours. I did the deed everyday starting on cycle day 9 until and including cycle day 16 just to be sure. My cycles are typically 28 days long, sometimes 29 and I bleed for 6 days. On day 13 I seen my LH surge and I assume I ovulated day 14/15.HCG strips- I got my first and VERY faint postive cycle day 23, the next day again, still very faint. However the day after it got a little darker. I couldn’t tell a difference in days unless I wanted two days, which makes sense as hormones double every 48-72 hours. So if you’re testing everyday don’t set discouraged thinking it’s a chemical pregnancy because the line seems too faint. Mine didn’t get darker until cycle day 27 the day before “my period”. And even then, it could be darker, it’s still only medium pink. But I took a clear blue test to be sure and this was much darker and very clearly bright positive. Today is my missed period and I’m 4 weeks pregnant first try with these strips. Please remember that even a faint positive is a positive, it will slowly get darker but you won’t be satisfied with the darkness until after your period has been missed lol.

These are great for folks going through fertility treatments where you may need multiple pregnancy tests. These are extremely sensitive and will detect hcg at 25 mIU/ml (which is a lot lower than most other companies). These are a great cost effective option that provide accurate results super early. I also can't say enough good things about the ovulation strips, they have their own app that helps you track your lh surges. It's super user friendly, I highly recommend them.

My husband and I haven't had the easiest road on our fertility journey, and multiple cycles later ovulation and pregnancy tests were getting too expensive to keep purchasing. This is a reliable, inexpensive option, and both the pregnancy and ovulations tests are just as sensitive as the well known store bought brands. There is also a great app you can download called premom which gages your ovulation tests and tells you exactly when to start trying.  The app also includes all sorts of really useful tips and personalized information and an online community of women who are all having similar struggles. I highly recommend.

You actually get a lot of strips to test for ovulation and pregnancy. Lasted a lot longer then I expected. I know some women use them almost religiously several times a day, but honestly if u just test for ovulation after ur period even a couple times a day till u find ur peak. And u only use the pregnancy tests just before period, this 1 box can last u a few months of testing.I found the ovulation testing was very accurate, as well the pregnancy strips are early detection. So if u feel the need to start testing days before ur period you'll be able to start seeing a faint line right away if ur pregnant. If ur not, you'll get no second line at all.Also with the app and the testing, the app has a feature for u to take pictures of ur testing for tracking as wellThey have an amazing app that is free with option to buy their program which can provide u with a lot of useful information if u need it. They will also have deals on this package and you can opt for a few months or longer. No adds on the app. There's even a community tab you can take to other women in same situations.I recommended just the app alone to my other friend and she was really impressed with how well it started tracking her info right away.I've bought their kit a couple times and use the app all the time! Highly recommend!

The TWW kills me, I obsessively POAS. I tested on 9, 10, and 11 dpo with FRER and they were all stark white negatives. My Easy@Home were delivered at 12dpo and I got my first VFL! Used the whole 20 pack to watch my line progression.

If you buy on Amazon, expect a fake.
Reviewed in Canada on November 8, 2016Colour Name: Deep RedVerified Purchase
I was shipped a fake.  Not even a convincing one; L3 and R3 are extremely loud, there are huge dead zones on the left thumb stick, the plastic is flimsy and sharply cut and you can see through it so the LEDs inside can be seen from any angle instead of just through the little viewports for them, the color is wrong, and the RESET button is conspicuously missing; there's a hole for it, but no actual button.  As if that wasn't proof enough, SCPTool actually announced that I'd plugged in a fake DS3 when I hooked it up to my PC as it apparently can tell the difference.So I read some other reviews.  Lots of other reviews from people who got fakes, all from sellers with different names.  And then there are lots of reviews from people saying ""Hmm, this color seems to be very cheap and flimsy compared to the other colors I've owned"" -- Really, it's not that one color is more cheaply-made than another.  What happened is that you got a fake.  It looks like these sellers just pop up with a random name, ship out fakes until they're shut down, then re-open with a new name and scam more people.  I imagine the guys who shipped me this fake will be shut down, but another seller is just going to pop up and do the same thing based on what I'm seeing in these other reviews.At this point in the PS3's life span it won't be easy to find brand-new DS3 controllers.  But I recommend against trying to buy them on Amazon, because it apparently has the same problem as eBay: sketchy sellers shipping out counterfeit items hoping to scam you out of your money.

The controller was as described, I don't know if in the description it says it comes with a wire to charge  the controller or not but they sent one with mine as it is usually NOT included with the controller. I have 4 kids on top of their friends coming over then I have 6 or 7 kids in the house wanting to play games on the ps3 so needless to say I needs a lot of controllers so it gets expensive as I have to buy new controllers with time as some gets broken as someone accidentally drop them or my youngest banged them etc. and I bought some cheap ones online which is I was very happy with the price BUT one day when my son asked me to play minecraft with him I couldn't believe how terrible the controllers were so from that moment on I decided I would only buy the Sony controllers even though they're so expensive so long story just to say I was very happy when I found this controller on amazon for this price for a new controller and not used,even if they're still expensive it's still cheaper than the regular price of  $60 and I'm hoping when I need to buy another one I'll be able to buy it at a similar price or evendors cheaped as im not sure why they're so expensive... I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good product at a great price!

PS3 Classic Controller Works Classically Well...
Reviewed in Canada on August 23, 2016Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
The OEM controller functioned perfectly one day, started acting up the next.  Time to replace.  Of course, everything's PS4 now, and trying to find a local replacement PS3 controller was actually impossible.  When I did find one, over twice the price of this replacement product.  Decision made, product purchased, received it in about a month.  Works perfectly, paired up the the PS3 console first try.  Nice to feel solid, crisp controls again.Cool feature; like a cordless mouse it hibernates if you leave it alone for a period of time.  You have to press the PS button to re-connect and continue operations.  My OEM controller never did that.  Hopefully make the battery last longer between charges.Liking it so much, glad I bought 2.  Even coming to like the white colour; a bit easier to find in the dark.

Decent but wary
Reviewed in Canada on January 4, 2020Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Not bad, was very concerned on how the controller arrived in box. Literally two bigger bubble pads, I geuss they were supposed to be on either side of it but it came with one already popped. The controller was just bouncing around in the box so dont know how this will affect longevity. Controller itself looked in decent conditions, some scratches and dings over it but fairly minimal. Had some odd glitches with it at first where it didnt seem to read some of the responses (analog movement, button pressing) but seems to have stopped and started working properly. Quite concerned on how long it will last considering all of this. Probably a better idea to just buy new and avoid the hassles and worries of receiving something like this or buy a complete cheaper one so you wont worry about qaulity at all.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 Purchased the Flag on April 2023Flag is located on the corner of my yard where it can be very windy, direct sunlight all day all week and color are still as bright red as when it was purchased. However as mentioned that my area gets a bit windy it actually freyed the end of the flag and totally ripped it off. The rest of the Flag are still intact and still waving quiet gracefully.The Maple leaf is not laminated on nor printed on with stiching. It is actually embroidered. And it stands out quiet beautiful and proudly displayed.The only dissapointing issue is that for only 6 month old the Flag had already freyed and ripped off at the end especially the nylon material supposedly made of 210 Denier and I know what Denier is all about as I work for a textile company(DUPONT) it should of last a little longer that 6 month.I don't think it's worth for the asking price. I know I will never purchased it from themI will try other Flag seller in the future.Therefore I'll leave it up you to purchase it.

I could not write a commercial to explain just how amazing this little device has become part of my life.  it is amazing and I keep it with me everywhere I go.  It has saved me from being at lunch and when I touch my face I feel a dreadful hair on my chin and not a tweezer in sight.  Just a quick buzz and it is gone with no redness and I feel so soft after I use it with NO creams.  Easy to clean and works beyond my expectations. This is the one thing I really did need in my life to save me from embarrassing moments when I see or feel something on my face or hairline that just does not belong. I bought one for my best friend and she carries it with her everywhere too and feels the same way about hers. When in the washroom at a meeting or out for dinner and something appears in the mirror, it is fixed instantly and I did not have to try to disguise the fuzz or even a single black hair!  It is part of my DAILY make-up routine as even though I do not have to use it daily, it makes my skin so very soft it makes my make-up look so much better.  I am so glad my daughters do not have to wait until they are my age to have this at the disposal and be a part of their lives.  We all carry lipstick and now we carry lipstick and FLAWLESS. I tell everyone I meet as this is truly a necessity in every woman's life.

Impressive Hair Remover!
Reviewed in Canada on September 29, 2018Colour Name: Sea Glass/Rose GoldVerified Purchase
I'm so impressed with this facial hair remover. It is gentle on my sensitive facial skin leaving no redness, no irritation, and no rash. The head glides easily over my skin removing fuzz on my chin, above my lip, long the jaw bone, and those few pesky eye brow hairs that grow too quickly. The head moves in a circular motion that does not pull or tug. It's very easy to use. Uses one AA battery that seems to last a very long time. Cleaning is easy. Replacement heads are available through either the company or Amazon for a reasonable price. I enjoy the small built in light that lets me see my eye brow line so I don't remove too many hairs. It also lets me see any fine hairs. It does remove hair instantly and painlessly. I love the colours of the sea blue and rose gold. Lovely! I highly recommend this product.

Great choice in a modern cell phone.
Reviewed in Canada on February 11, 2023Colour: CharcoalVerified Purchase
Great phone at a good price point. The internet is full of rave reviews going into great detail about this phone. I chose it mainly because it has a great camera and it is capable of ""Always on"", and it isn't bloated with preloaded ""stuff"" like my old Huawei. We live in a ""cell phone world"" and there are many choices out there and I wanted a phone that I would be happy with for some time to come.Fast camera, quality OLED screen, Gorilla glass, 5G, water resistance rating and a decent livable size.  Phones can be huge making it difficult to manage in your day to day. How and where do you put it? This size can be put in your pocket or be worn on the belt.More about the ""Always On"". I appreciate the fact that when the phone is beside me, I can glance at it without touching it and it gives me information; Day, Date, Time etc. Not all screens/phones can do this.It has only been a week and I am still getting used to (and surprised by) all the features. I can recommend this phone without hesitation.

I grabbed this in March and it's been a great everyday phone. I use it as my secondary phone so it doesn't have very many apps on in etc, but I use it for a lot of video shooting and photography and the battery life holds up quite well compared to my Pixel 4. The astrophotography is just as good as the older pixels -- makes sense since they use the same sensor. The tensor chip is great but like I said it's my secondary phone so I dont really push the tensor chip to its limits, but it works wonderfully for computational photography :)

Don't be afraid to replace the ear tips
Reviewed in Canada on November 21, 2021Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
It is a bit of a story but I hope this helps others if they also experience problems with the OEM memory foam ear tips.First impressions were bad.  So bad that I was right away thinking they need to be returned because I found them unwearable.  I could not get a comfortable fit with the foam ear tips that came with it.  After messing with them for a while I used the Sony headphone app to test all 3 ear tip sizes and it told me which size was best for each ear.  So I then used the app to adjust, test, adjust, test until I got a proper seal according to the app.  Every time I put them on I had to do at least 3 adjust until the app said I had a proper seal.  But it never felt right ... I heard too much outside noise even with ANC on ... and bass was missing --- both are indications of a poor seal.  But it was the best seal I could get with the best fitting tip, and they hurt my ears.They hurt my skin where the foam pressed and they never seemed to seal quite right.  I didn't look forward to using them, and I had to take them out after only about half an hour.  So at this point I was sure I would be returning them.But I had a 10 year old Sony DR-BT160AS wireless headphone so I took the very old and dated tips off them and put them on these XM4 and wow!  They were noticeably sealed properly and comfortable!  I used the app and they were sealed properly according to the app each time I put them on without any messing around.  The bass is noticeably the way the content should be.  And the noise isolation was very good even with the ANC off, and of course much better with the ANC on.I am now quite happy with them.  They are comfortable and sound quite good.  I can wear them as long as any other comfortable fitting ear buds now that I have gotten rid of those foam things.I plan to find some silicone tips that are perhaps more modern with better sound capability, but really, they sound quite good with these 10 - 15 year old silicone tips, and the sound isolation is pretty good.So my suggestion is this:If you find them uncomfortable, or not really blocking outside noise even though the app says they are sealed, then I would strongly suggest trying silicone tips - preferably from another set of ear buds that you know fit right.My other advice is you will need to mess with the sound equalizer and bass.  They sound quite unimpressive and dull in the default settings.  So take the time to adjust the sound to match your preferences.  Mine perked up nicely when I added a little ""clear bass"" to +3 and added some a small boost to 400 and 1k hz.OK, now about the XM4 ear buds:- They are extremely accurate so you will hear EVERYTHING in a song.  So if you have poor quality MP3 then you will hear that.  Years ago I recorded some old albums to MP3 and they were pretty good but vinyl has some pops and snaps, and they sure do stand out on the MX4.- As you probably read, you can control pause & next song & previous song --- OR --- volume up & volume down.  NOT BOTH.  Disappointing, and I think an error by Sony to not allow both controls at the same time.  My work around is that I have it set to pause & next song & previous song, and I use google assistant to control volume ... and the ear buds hear ""hey google"" almost every time, so it really is not a problem for me.  So now if I want more volume, then I say ""hey google"" and then ""turn volume up"" and it works good, but I still a work around on a bad decision by Sony.- I find ""speak to chat"" an interesting idea but it is not great.  I prefer to pause and turn on ambient sound to chat, and that way it doesn't constantly cut in and out.  Interesting concept but I think it needs more work to be practical.  The ambient sound turned to highest setting does allow you to talk.- DSEE Extreme (fix losses due to compressing music) seems to work decent but I do find it tires me a bit, so I am leaving it off for now.  Mostly it seems to add too much edge or sharpness.  But I am still getting used to these new earbuds, so later I intend to play with it a little more.Overall, I am very pleased with how they sound.  And that, above all else, is the most important thing.

I have used expensive over-ear headphones that don't even come close to the noise cancellation these pair of earphones offer (mainly compared with the Momentum 3 wireless).I truly can't hear ANYTHING when commuting with low-volume music playing. The transparency mode is good, but nothing contests the Airpods pro transparency mode for me. Still great transparency though, I am just a little spoilt. Most things about the build quality also feel good. The hinge on the case is a little squeaky and not that tight feeling, but the earbuds and the rest of the case feel amazing. Nice matte finish, and quality. The case is definitely chunkier than the Airpods pro case but it doesn't bother me. The XM3 case did definitely bother me. The sound quality is great, really clean sounding with a nice bass. Paired with the noise cancellation it is truly next level. Really nice sounding. Much cleaner and balanced than the Pros and the 1000xm3. The controls are good, but since using the pros, I have never preferred touch controls. The pressure sensor on the pros are just unbelievably good. The controls are top-tier compared to other touch sensor buds, though. I've used the galaxy buds Pro as well as the 1000XM3s but these are by far the most responsive and quick. Comfort is great too, they fit in my ear really well and almost never fall off. The pros fit in my ear unbelievably well but these still fit in my ear great and don't get close to falling out. The XM3s never fit well in my ear and would fall out often. The battery life on these is AMAZING, 8 hours of ANC is truly a luxury. I remember, I woke up, put on the buds, and ate lunch, went to the gym, worked out, went to the library, studied, and went back home, and still had 30% remaining battery. I never took off the buds once. This is truly the biggest difference between the pros and these buds. The battery life is so noticeable and amazingOverall, Sony nailed this. They have everything. Best in class ANC, great comfort, amazing sound, responsive controls, great battery life, great transparency mode, amazing build quality.+ they look pretty stylish. Subjective though xD

Great game to play with kids 6 and up friends and family. A lot of fun! The cards store in a compartment under the game which is great so you can’t  lose them and it makes the game a grab and go.The only thing I wished it had was ALL the letters of the alphabet, there is no Q, U, V, X, Y,  and Z. Even my 6 year old grandson needed to use these missing letters in the game. I would have given 5 stars if it had all the letters.

The price is well within reason and the quality is remarkably good.  It charges my tablet up and I am happy with it.

Comfortable and Absorbent, Though Occasional Leaks: Pampers Swaddlers Size 6 Diapers
Reviewed in Canada on November 6, 2023Size: Size 6Style: DiapersVerified Purchase
As a parent of a spirited three-year-old, I have turned to Pampers Swaddlers Size 6 Diapers for their exceptional comfort and absorbency. These diapers offer a snug fit and reliable protection, but it's worth noting that occasional leaks do occur, especially for my active toddler.The fit of these diapers is commendable. The Size 6 Swaddlers provide a comfortable and secure fit, allowing my child to move freely without feeling restricted. The flexible waistband and leg cuffs create a gentle seal, preventing most leaks and ensuring my son's comfort during his daily activities.In terms of absorbency, Pampers Swaddlers perform well for the most part. They effectively absorb wetness and keep my child dry for extended periods, minimizing the risk of diaper rash and discomfort. The wetness indicator remains a valuable feature, aiding in timely diaper changes, though we have encountered occasional leaks despite our best efforts to change promptly.While these diapers have provided consistent overnight protection, my son's high activity levels sometimes lead to unexpected leaks during the day. Although this has been a challenge, the soft and breathable materials of the Swaddlers have proven gentle on my son's sensitive skin, which is a crucial factor in our diaper choice.The bulk packaging with 108 diapers in one box offers convenience and good value, ensuring we are well-supplied for our diapering needs. Despite the occasional leaks, the overall reliability and comfort of Pampers Swaddlers make them a practical choice for parents of active toddlers.In summary, Pampers Swaddlers Size 6 Diapers deliver on their promise of comfort and absorbency, making them a reliable option for most situations. However, parents of highly active toddlers should be aware of the possibility of occasional leaks. Despite this challenge, the diapers' softness and the wetness indicator provide peace of mind, making them a solid choice for everyday use. While not perfect, Pampers Swaddlers still offer a comfortable and convenient solution for diapering needs.

Overall the diaper is good. It has good absorbency and leak proof. My baby moves a lot and sometimes the yellow part of the belt strap cuts through his belly and thigh skin. I wish the strap were softer so that it does not hurt the baby even if it is misplaced somehow. Because of that now I am always extra worried and make sure that part is covered with softer parts of the diaper.Note: the diaper size is perfect for him. He is 21lb.

Recommended TENS Unit!
Reviewed in Canada on September 6, 2023Style: Professional HealthcareVerified Purchase
I did a lot of research before picking a TENS Unit.  The TENS 7000 came with high recommendations.  Having gotten it, I can see why!It's powerful, 2 channels, 5 modes, and you can set the Rate (Hz) and Pulse Width.  Many lesser units do not let the user adjust the latter two variables.I was amazed by the stay of sensations I could dial in by adjusting the settings.  Definitely paid for itself when I put for electrodes on my lower back and had an amazing massage and pain relief experience.  This unit is also recommended as a beginner's e-stim unit, but if you want to know about that, search Reddit.  All I can say is I am really happy I chose the 7000 unit.  The price is excellent value.There is a bit of a learning curve if you are new to TENS however the unit comes with a great manual and settings are individual to what you are using it for and per person.  A physiotherapist can help, or just look on YouTube!There unit comes with 4 pad electrodes.  They are good quality but will have a limited number of uses, considered buying some extra electrode pads or some conductive adhesive gel for reuse.  This is normal and these are considered consumables.I'm still on the included 9V battery, but I also bought some extra rechargeable 9V batteries.Totally pleased and enthusiastically recommend!

The product works as suggested and it was easy to figure out how to use it with the quick reference card included. The pads were quite sticky so no problem with adhesion. I had mild to moderate pain relief but I used a very low setting so far. If you think ""it's not doing anything"" dial up the number on the top right dial until you feel something. I think it would be difficult to hurt yourself or go wrong with this. There is a guard at the top to prevent the dial from turning on its own. Follow the instructions and do the steps in the order suggested and you'll be safe.

Beyerdynamic 990 DT pro 250ohmThese headphones are easily my favorite for home use. This is my second pair. First pair which I still have in use is 3rd year owning it. Love them so much I bought this second set so I don't ha r to keep moving them around home.-extremely comfortable with velvety ear pads that completely surround the ear and do not touch the ear. I can wear this for hours upon hours.-very lightweight so it doesn't feel too exhausting over time-sound quality is second to none at this price tag ( got it for 230 here !). It is an open back headphone so it sound stage is extremely wide and you don't feel like you're enclosed. I well mixed stereo album sounds tremendously full and wide. No closed ear  design can possibly match this. It is a similar experience to open back grado headphones.... Except grado is the worst in terms of comfort.  By the way.... Open back isn't good for office usage due to obvious reasons of sound leaking out .-Crisp highs, without being harsh .. straight out of the box without much break in time. Well balanced mid and lows without sounding DJ bassy nor booomy and muddy.  Very tight fast sound for all types of music.  The best for me is listening to acoustic unplugged style albums such as Sarah McLachlan , Norah Jones and the like.- this versions comes with coiled Cable and isn't interchangeable. Unfortunate.  I prefer straight cable without coil. That is my only negative feedback for this particular headphones.I can't say enough how amazing these sound for the price.  Highly recommended from me.

            Beyerdynamic 990 DT pro 250ohmThese headphones are easily my favorite for home use. This is my second pair. First pair which I still have in use is 3rd year owning it. Love them so much I bought this second set so I don't ha r to keep moving them around home.-extremely comfortable with velvety ear pads that completely surround the ear and do not touch the ear. I can wear this for hours upon hours.-very lightweight so it doesn't feel too exhausting over time-sound quality is second to none at this price tag ( got it for 230 here !). It is an open back headphone so it sound stage is extremely wide and you don't feel like you're enclosed. I well mixed stereo album sounds tremendously full and wide. No closed ear  design can possibly match this. It is a similar experience to open back grado headphones.... Except grado is the worst in terms of comfort.  By the way.... Open back isn't good for office usage due to obvious reasons of sound leaking out .-Crisp highs, without being harsh .. straight out of the box without much break in time. Well balanced mid and lows without sounding DJ bassy nor booomy and muddy.  Very tight fast sound for all types of music.  The best for me is listening to acoustic unplugged style albums such as Sarah McLachlan , Norah Jones and the like.- this versions comes with coiled Cable and isn't interchangeable. Unfortunate.  I prefer straight cable without coil. That is my only negative feedback for this particular headphones.I can't say enough how amazing these sound for the price.  Highly recommended from me.

Have stood the test of time
Reviewed in Canada on November 11, 2023Size: 250 OHMColour Name: GrayVerified Purchase
I ordered about a dozen headphones in this price range from Amazon and meticulously tested them all. This was my favorite open-back set, so I returned the rest and committed to this one. I also kept the closed-back version, the 770s. I use them to listen to music while I work for about 6 hours a day, and I also use them to watch movies. I bought them over a year ago so I have put 2 or 3 thousand hours on them by now. They continue to work flawlessly and the sound quality remains phenomenal. They are also extraordinarily comfortable, I don't even realize I am wearing them.If you are debating between open-back and closed-back, I know how you feel. I wrestled with that dilemma too. However, I can honestly say that I've probably only used the closed-back 770s for maybe 10-20 hours compared to the several thousands of hours I've clocked on the 990s. In my mind, the only reason to use closed-backs is if you *require* noise cancellation. Open-back is a whole different experience, it really 'opens up' the sound so that it doesn't feel like it is just 'in your head'. I also like that I can hear people ask me questions from other rooms, I can hear appliance timers or alarms, etc. I can have a conversation with someone without taking them off. Open-back is the way to go unless to *need* noise cancellation.

Amazing headphones, but the treble...
Reviewed in Canada on August 9, 2023Size: 250 OHMColour Name: GrayVerified Purchase
I've been on my audio journey for some months now, experimenting with different brands, driver types, connection types (bluetooth, aux) and frequency responses. Throughout this journey, all of the audio equipment I've used typically had a v-shaped tuning; extreme bass, recessed-to-the-ground mids, and treble high enough to feel like a needle is penetrating your ears. Again, this type of tuning is subjective to each individual, and I used to be a large subscriber to this type of tuning. However, a few months ago I decided to take a leap into the ""neutral zone"" and bought my first pair of iems... the Letshuoer S12's. Yes, I know, those iems are not AT ALL neutral/flat. If anything they're actually very v-shaped. The point is that this was my FIRST STEP, and at the time I thought the bass was actually ""lacking"" (for context, I had only had experience with Bluetooth earphones). So, once I decided to get headphones, I decided to get something even MORE in the ""neutral zone""...So here we are. The DT990 Pro. To many, these headphones are it; the last stage in their audio journey. For me it was anyway. The bass isn't boomy, but punchy and accurate. The mids are not recessed/overpowered nearly as much as they are on the S12's. And the treble is... the exact same, of not more sibilant than the S12's? Okay, I won't lie, when I got these initially I thought that it sounded super flat. However, recently I decided to try out the ER4SR. Those are FLAT. I mean, they are ""____"". And while flat sounding doesn't equal ""good sounding"" and it's purely subjective, I've found that that flat sound is MY subjective taste. So now let's go back to these headphones, they sound amazing, but since I've now adjusted to the sound of the Etymotics, these sound a lot more sibilant and airy. Again, while this may be a good thing for some (and an objective good thing for making out subtle mistakes in audio production), it is no longer for me. So, since the purchase of the ER4SR, my up-to-date personal review of the sound goes like this:  Bass: Amazing! Not really much to complain about here. It does slightly overpower some vocals in some songs, but I'm only saying that because I know how more-upfront mids sound, so not really a complaint.  Mids: As I said, they do sound slightly recessed, but not enough to make it a complaint. It is very good, and all vocals sound full.  Treble: This is where I am a bit more critical, as you could probably tell be the text leading up to this part. It does seem to be a bit more sibilant and harsh in the treble compared to the ER4SR. And while that can cause problems like overpowering the midrange, it's all very subjective and varies person to person. Some people will think that the treble is too much, some will think the treble is perfect, and some might even say it's not enough (and I hope the people in the latter seek a priest to perform an exorcism). But I think the objective truth is that these aim to have a very ""clinical"" sound, which allows for a more meticulous analysis of music, meaning that the somewhat-harsh treble is therefore justified.So why 4 stars if it's all very subjective? Why not 5 stars? While the sound is amazing for the price, the 1 star loss is mostly a result of the comfort. The headband starts to feel like it's digging into my skull when I wear it for 2 or less hours, the pads feel kind of hard when they're clamped on each side of your head, and the circular cups HAVE TO GO. The thing that the MEZE Empyreans do for the earcups is such an innovative design (and no, I've never heard, let alone seen, the headphones in-person). Also, off topic, I decided to mod my pair of DT990 Pros so that I could use the 4.4mm part of my Fosi DS1 DAC and therefore have more power being inputted into the headphones. Also, the mod allows the cables to be replaced.In conclusion, I like to end my reviews with a out-of-5 star rating. However, since these headphones have a very clinical approach to their tuning, I thought I'd do something similar. So, I give these amazing sounding DT990 Pros a 4.4195037484950272649598737385957372626485947252848593627284958/5.

The price of these sardines has been going up over the last few years. It’s nice to be able to find them cheaper because I feed them to my dogs. The only consideration is temperature. Today the shipment was frozen, so the texture of the fish is ruined. Thankfully, it seems my dogs will still eat them so they don’t have to go to waste. I would suggest not ordering during arctic weather.

UPDATEMay 10/2023As I suspected, the large tough (industrial) sardines seem to be a different batch and source than the market ones. I found a 2-year-old can of store-bought Brunswick sadines and guess what? Not only were there 4 smaller sardines in the can, biut also another small one hiding underneath. So, a total of 5 SARDINES! Of course, being smaller, they were more tender and enjoyable than the larger ones in the Amazon sardine cans. FACT: EVERY Amazobought can had 3 large sardines in it! Same with a new batch I just received! WHAT IS UP WITH THAT !?!?!  The 'ol bait'n switch, eh? Disappointing... So of course I canceled my revolving order.Store-bought batch: 1288CB BB/MA: 2024 OCT 15Amazon-bought batch: 1249BXN BB/MA 2025 SEP 06_______________________________________________May 3/2023I have been this exact brand of sardines for decades. This is my first time buying a case through Amazon. I have found the taste the same (ok), but they are definitely larger and tougher. Many have actually been on the chewy side, which I do not recall from past purchases in supermarket. Recently, I bought some 'Gabriel' sardines from a local market and they were Portuguese--much more tender, tastier, and 4 to a can (CA$2.50 retail). Big difference!

This is not a medicine, it will not cure your flu or cold but if you start at early signs it can contain it or really aleviate symptoms. I use it now for my own kids and it does exactly what it states it does, help with symptoms. It is a must in any household, as a supplement to your medication or standalone. We buy it from here because of the value(at my local natural shop they don't cary the 30 dose package).

Upon opening the box you can understand right away something is wrong. Such odor you can experience in smoke rooms at some airports. I am not against smoking but the item was never cleaned, it was somewhat dirty but the smell was very heavy. I would have to close my nose to use it and my kids - I simply cannot let them use that.

Works well, lots of fun
Reviewed in Canada on January 18, 2024Style: PlayStation|PCPattern Name: Wheel OnlyVerified Purchase
I've used this wheel for about 30 hours now. It works very well on the PS5. Set up was very simple. I'm very happy with it. I attached it to an old table which makes it very stable. I also purchased the shifter addition which is very fun as well. The force feedback from the wheel is great and gives a good sense of realism. The pedals have some resistance as well, especially the brake which takes a bit of getting use to. I find the pedals slide around a bit on the hardwood floors but a small mat or something should fix that pretty cheaply. Overall, as a beginner to racing wheels and games, I would recommend this to others who would like to try it out. It's more fun than I imagined.

I love this wheel. The built quality is amazing and the force feedback is realistic. I can tune it to feel like I am driving a Toyota Corolla in driving simulators and It auto tunes in Forza for the car you’re driving.When you go off-road or when a consistency of asphalt road changes, you feel the different in your steering wheel just like how real car steering works. Bumps, change of road height, collision, off-road plant destruction … yea you name it. It all registers. When you go fast in a car it also brings realistic force in the wheelOverall it’s amazing

I've never had ear buds before and thought I should have a pair. I bought a pair if the Sony wf 1000xm4.These were the top of the line buds from Sony, I shouldn't have any issues right? Wrong!  They just wouldn't fit properly. Bulky and they wouldnt fit, As a result the sound also suffered. I just wasn't happy at all with them. So I took them back and started the search again.Long story short ....I tried a pair of Samsung Pro buds 2 and love them! the fit is perfect, noise cancelling is excellent in my opinion, and as  a result the sound is great!! Music is clear and very rich, podcasts are as if you were in the room yourself!I highly recommend these!They work well, and are well made .....

After comparing all the new headphones, I decided to pick these up (Buds2 Pro) and I have been very happy with them. The sound quality is extremely clear and the Active Noise Cancelling works sublime and feels very comfortable. In conjunction with my Samsung phone, the Wearables App lets me fine tune all the options I wanted in customizing the capabilities of these buds. There are tons of ways to play around with the headphones but I do love having them on a 'dynamic' EQ setting. I would highly recommend anyone that is on the fence to pick these headphones up.I also brought these from the eKings seller for $157 and they are indeed genuine.The box was still correctly sealed and showed no signs of tampering.

Have been using the first Galaxy Buds for a while, and was not impressed with the battery, likely had a bad unit or something, didn't like to hold a charge in the case for all that long. Decided to get these buds2 pro, as I hear the battery life and sound quality are just better, and I am not disappointed. I have only charged the case twice, when I got them as the case was dead, and a few days ago as the case light was yellow indicating around half battery. Have had these for about a month and use them occasionally, and actually look forwards to using them, which for me that says a lot. If you can afford them, I highly recommend these!

I LOVE these! These are THE best TWE's I've ever owned, lighter and much more svelte than the AirPods Pro's 1 & 2, and equally deep, quality unmuffled bass as the older Sony WMF-1000X3's I super love the 24-bit Hi-Res Audio capability and connection reliability with my Galaxy S23's, and the auto ambient enabled by simply talking. You need to enable this in Galaxy Wear app that comes pre-installed and you get to choose between 5, 10, 15 seconds after conversation stops for Ambient Sound to auto disable.Like the AirPods Pro's you'll forget these are in your ears if Ambient Sound is ON/OFF (along with ANC Off). Yet the ear canal seal is more closely fit with my tiny ears - earlobe to top of my ear is 6cm lol. Usually I would use small ear tips but medium proved to be a ""good/secure fit"" via testing, but head shake proves too loose. Using small resolved that for me.

            It’s tasking on the pc to run this monitor. Make sure you have hardware to support. Not all games support or run well on this. 32:9 is uncommon but those that do look amazing on this.The colors are incredibly good. Noticeable difference from average monitor color depth.

 size is aweomse.picture is good.gaming is good but to play at the full resolution you need to rely on dlss or your frames will be crap.only 6 months in and its got horrible distortion/interference. Ive tried multiple hdmi and multipl DP cables. tried different ports on the video card and even upgraded to an entirely new pc. Same issues. my g7 34 inch. zero issues and also in the same card.opened a case with samsung (that alone takes a days worth of commitment since theyre site is broken in most places).They asked for video evidence. I sent it and they opened a new case... they never replied and closed my cases and marked my repair complete. Now im spending another few hours trying to talk to their chat cuz theres no other way to reach them... its not going well.stay far away... waste of money. waste of time.

Awesome but some things to know.
Reviewed in Canada on December 7, 2020Model: LC49G95TSSNXZASize: 49 inchVerified Purchase
I read online forums and watched all the Youtubers for 3-4 months before purchasing this monitor. My two worries were scaling applications easily like a two monitor setup, and if a 2060 video card could push hard enough to play games as 30X0 series video cards are nearly impossible to find at the time of this review. There's a downloadable app called PowerToys with a something called ""Fancy Windows"" that allows you to divide up the screen very easily for productivity apps and it's actually glorious for me. I have 3 apps divided up evenly on the screen and there is lots of real-estate for it at the native 5140x1440. I had thought that I would have to run the 2060 video at 1080p, but have been surprised that by turning down to medium settings in games I can 70-90 fps in top titles at the full native resolution. I know most people would prefer to see over 100 fps, including me, but whether it's g-sync or something else, it feels smooth and is truly incredible. Far Cry 5, Witcher 3, Doom Ultimate, Battlefield 4, Battle Front 2, Elder Scrolls online all look great with minimal to no stretching at the sides. Fallout 76 is a mess as it has terrible support for Ultrawide. I only had to turn one game down to 1080p and I honestly cannot really tell. RTX is unusable dropping even Quake RTX down to 13 fps but it was never a great option on a 2060 anyway. In terms of the monitor itself. HDMI sound is not working. I'm deciding if I want to try a firmware update to fix this. I'm not sure it's that important to me. HDR is great in games and most games see it and turn it on without needing to turn on the dismal Windows implementation of HDR. The colour is great and the whites are very white. I didn't know what I was missing with my old ASUS gaming monitor. I definitely recommend this to a gamer that is savvy with their tech. If you are not a tech type and are uncomfortable with changing resolution settings and fixing glitches when you change the wrong setting, you might want to wait until there is better windows and game support for these.

Great all-around mic
Reviewed in Canada on May 2, 2017Colour Name: BlackoutStyle: MicrophoneVerified Purchase
Some microphones are designed to be right up to your mouth and drop off sharply with distance.  This is not that.  This picks up the whole room.  It's not that one is better than the other, but that's what this does, and it does it well, so if that's what you need (but only if that's what you need) this is going to be great.  On minimum gain, there is no noticeable self noise in the recordings, and at full gain, it is present but not an issue unless you need a perfectly clean source, like recording music, etc.  The sensitivity, especially at full gain is amazing. Like I said, it really does pick up a room, and even things outside it on occasion.  If you are a singer, you won't need* to be all that close to this. If you are quite powerful, you might have to be even over a foot away to not clip.  *I say ""need"" but ""be able to"" could be swapped in here depending on how you view this...I find the sound quality to be very good.  I don't have a ton of reference for this but it seems neutral and clear.Blue advertises this as plug and play (""driverless"") and it is.  It even works plugged into a Raspberry Pi 3.  Very easy to setup and use.The pickup pattern selector is a cool feature.  You are not bound by having just one kind of mic with this - it can be cardioid, omnidirectional, ""front and back"", and even stereo.  Personally, I find the rear muting of cardioid vs omnidircetional to be minimal at best, but you've still got the choice between an omnidirectional mic, and a true stereo (and boy does it work) at the flick of a switch.  Very cool.This also offers a built-in 3.5 mm jack for you to plug in headphones.  They will playback anything the mic receives with zero lag, which is great for monitoring.  They will also playback anything you want from the computer since you can select the mic as an output/playback device in the OS's sound settings.  The volume of each of these is independently controllable in sound settings as well.  Finally, the built in amp is decently powerful, able to go much louder than my onboard audio.  With the Yeti at about 25% it's already matching or beating my onboard at 50%, and that's a level I can't imagine anyone needing to exceed (that said this will obviously vary by headphone).But here is where we get into all my (rather minor, but plentiful) complaints:> On the topic of the 3.5mm jack, the internal DAC is not great.  At moderate to high volume, background hiss is rather noticeable with nothing playing.  I also find subjectively that after listening to music for a long time (many hours), it just starts to get on my nerves.  Neither this nor the hiss is something that happens with my onboard audio, even at higher volumes.> The switch for pickup pattern on the back is rather tight and hard to turn> The knobs on the stand that you tighten to hold it in place aren't the easiest to get tight either.  I mean, it's easy enough to get it good enough that the mic won't move around on you, but they could definitely have been better> The mic on/off button creates a pop when used, and the light stays on flashing when it is off, and is on solid when on.  The on behaviour makes sense but I'd like it to just go off when it's off.  Yes, then you wouldn't be able to tell it even has power, but you should be aware of whether its plugged in or not.> Finally, the mic volume in sound settings seems to move around sometimes.  It's almost like the mic will turn itself down if something is too loud or turn itself up if it's quiet.  This might sound good in theory but there are reasons you wouldn't want that.

#1 Streaming Mic under $200
Reviewed in Canada on April 18, 2023Colour Name: BlackoutStyle: MicrophoneVerified Purchase
I knew this mic would be perfect for streaming and gaming because I have talked to numerous people who own/use Yeti Blue every day, and it is exactly what you want. Unless you are spending over $200. This mic is built properly, it's tough and weighty, it sounds amazing, and it's plug and use. A non-tech savvy grandmother could set this up. Pay the little extra and you're set.The only note I will make is that if you are using a mic arm (highly suggested, professional looking and if you bump your desk with the stock table-base setup, it will cause playback) So get a microphone arm and order the mic screw adapters (on amazon) by avatarr. 1cm thread, adaptable to 19mm which is the yeti thread size. I got a mic arm at a pawn ship for $30, lucky but don't spend over $50 on a mic arm unless you are rich and starved for time. They are cheaply made and easily found at pawn/music shops.Happy creating, have fun and take care. Also, spread love.

Great little device for traveling
Reviewed in Canada on June 12, 2023Style: AirFly ProVerified Purchase
Works great and easy to set up (I just wanted the video on twelvesouth's YouTube page.) Sound was good and it kept a decent charge. Great for travel or devices that don't use Bluetooth. Light and easy to transport.

Great for flying, but with noise cancelling earphones!
Reviewed in Canada on April 24, 2023Style: AirFly ProVerified Purchase
The Airfly itself works great. A bit pricey, but the quality is there. I usually travel with my wired Sony earbuds for flight entertainment, but was excited to try the AirFly with my AirPods 2nd generation. Unfortunately, AirPods are not the best for in flight entertainment, unless you have the Pro ones for augmented noise cancellations. For that reason, I ended up going back to my wired earbuds, but that's not fault to the AirFly; planes are just too noisy for regular AirPods. So now I want the Pros to use with my AirFly on my next trip! haha! In the meantime, I'll use my AirFly at the gym.

Compact & easy to use
Reviewed in Canada on May 24, 2023Style: AirFly ProVerified Purchase
This arrived shortly before we flew and enabled my wife and I to listen to the on-board entertainment system using our own Air Pods.  I found it easy to set up and ready to use for two pairs of Apple Air Pods.  Other wireless earbuds or over the ear headsets should work as easy.  Having read other reviews I did set these up prior to flying - just in case of any difficulties.  The Airfly Pro comes in its own draw string cloth pouch and in pretty compact.  Also in the box was a USBA to USBC connector for recharging the power.  Sound quality is good with no noticeable latency.  I haven't yet tried this in the car as a Bluetooth device but will do in time.  If travelling on some European airlines you will need to acquire the two pronged adapter to plug in to the airline entertainment system and the Airfly then plugs in to that.  I purchased the Airfly in white but it can be purchased in black too.  If there is any deficiency in this I would suggest it is the lack of battery level indicator.  It is slated to have a 25 hour battery life and I charged mine ahead of travelling but I've no idea how long it takes to fully charge or indeed how much power remains after an 8 hour flight.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 HIGHLIGHTS of the new Echo Dot1) The response time is a little faster than on its predecessor. That said, I don't know if it's me, but I feel like Alexa can't hear me as well as on my gen3.2) Great new spherical shape.3) I really like the new location of the light which is now located at the bottom of the device. I find it more visible since it illuminates the surface on which the device is placed.4) The sound is ""richer"" with a little more bass and a wider angle of sound diffusion.5) The installation is very easy, 5 minutes and it's done!WEAKNESSES1) The CHARCOAL echo comes with a WHITE power cable... we agree that it's not very aesthetic... in any case, I don't like it. If I chose a black color it's because there was a reason, wasn't there?2) The power supply box is still as big as ever! Come on! it takes two power outlets wide...3) The buttons are really ugly and look cheap compared to previous generations. They're made out of some kind of plastic and are a little bit raised. I definitely preferred the smooth and flat buttons of the Echo Dot 3.4) Needs a few updates to improve the French Canadian version.I mainly use the Echo Dot to listen to my music on my sound bar. It's the functions, stop, pause, up/down the sound, put the sound at 3 to 7, next, who's that artist, add that song to my playlist, etc. that make my music listening experience much more enjoyable. No need to change tabs, or get up, everything is controlled by voice! Really convenient the voice technology combined with a subscription such as Amazon Music, Deezer and/or Spootify to listen to your music.SOUND | Compared to the Echo Dot 3rd generation, this one (4th gen) has a slightly improved sound. Probably this spherical style allows for a greater angle of sound diffusion. Rather than being propelled only upwards as on the 3rd gen, it diffuses both upwards and forward. In any case, if you don't like the sound of this dot, you can always pair your device with your sound bar/home theater. Personally, that's what I do, so sound quality is not a big concern for me. Having said that, I think it sounds really good for an alarm clock sized device! Also, the sound is much louder and richer than on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen no matter what some people say.IN SUMMARY | It can be used as an alarm clock, a timer, a calendar reminder, a calculator, help you fall asleep at night, answer your questions, give you quizzes, etc. There are so many things that can be done with this device that it is impossible to list them all here! Also, if you have other types of smart equipment, such as light bulbs, smart plugs, etc. you will surely find your own connection with this Echo Dot.

Reviewed in Canada on January 6, 2022Colour Name: CharcoalConfiguration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
Bought two units so I could play and control my Amazon Prime Music subscriptions in two parts of the house. I already had a Google Mini but it won't control Amazon Music.Compared to Google Mini:-Setup is equally easy on both-the voice on the Google Mini is clearer than Alexa on the Echo-music sound quality is slightly better on the Echo Dot-linking other smart items is easier, better, and more comprehensive on the Echo app-volume is similar on bothOverall, the Echo Dot edges out the Google Mini. I'll likely buy several more Echo Dots so I can play and control my music throughout the house from any room. Once I determine if the Echo can control my Google Nest Thermostat as easily as the Google Mini, I see little reason to keep the Mini active.

Impossible to clean
Reviewed in Canada on March 22, 2024Verified Purchase
I've used this daily for the past 4 months and it gets very gross very quickly.It is completely impossible to clean all the parts from mineral buildup and gunk. I only use filtered water to fill this up. The tube from which the mist comes out quickly gets covered in gunk and is so painful to clean out. The white top that disperses the mist is also really hard to clean even with q-tips or small tools. There is no way to open the water tank itself, so I resort to shaking some soapy water inside. The bottom part can be cleaned, but you have to be careful not to wet the electric parts and, again, some elements inside that are constantly in contact with water are very tough to get around to fully get rid of dirt and gunk.

Reviewed in Canada on January 30, 2024Verified Purchase
The humidifier works well and was what I expected but as someone sensitive to noise I had to return it. This was my first humidifier purchase so maybe it's unavoidable but the dripping sound of the water was super annoying to me, even though the actual operation of the humidifier is really quiet. Also, the design is such that water from the tank enters the bottom part as the water is used up and makes a loud gurgling ""bloop"" sound every so often which would wake me up. On top of that, when the tank would run out of water it would make a super subtle high-pitched pulsing tone, barely noticeable but just enough to annoy me. It also makes a similar very subtle high-pitched tone when it's plugged in but powered off.

I now understand the hype
Reviewed in Canada on November 11, 2022Size: 6QTStyle: Vortex PlusVerified Purchase
First impressions: Unopened damaged box looked like there might be some damage inside but product was ok, no doubt due to secure packing. It’s much larger than I had envisioned. It’s well made.It’s easy to clean the basket and inner tray with a bit of soapy water. I made sure not to immerse the basket. Wiped interior and exterior with a damp paper towel. Not much of an instruction booklet but luckily it’s very intuitive to use. Simple operation to change temp from °F to °C and to change presets. Ran an initial test run to break it in. Unlike many other users, there was only a very faint plastic smell on first use (during the test run) that dissipated quickly. I also did not find it to overly loud as some reviewers claimed. There is a hum, which you’d expect from any appliance with a fan, but it’s certainly not what I found to be loud.Display is large and easy to read. Controls are intuitive. Tried a small batch of (Costco) fries - Airfry 20 minutes @400°F. Next time will reduce time to 18 minutes. Very crisp!! Lovely colour. I’m impressed. Super easy clean up with soapy water. I can envision multiple ways to use this appliance everyday. Bonus: rapid preheat, doesn’t heat up the house like an oven, relatively quiet, quick and even cooking, easy non-stick cleanup.Very happy with my purchase. And the price was reasonable although it increased immediately (within minutes) after I bought it and fluctuates wildly from week to week. Nonetheless, I bought 2 more to set aside as gifts.

Love this machine, I had been holding out on buying an air fryer, but I am so happy with this one.  It is a great size, I bought liners so no clean up required.  The settings are very easy to use, beeps when it is pre-heated, beeps halfway through to flip food if required, looks great on my counter.

Good but not perfect.
Reviewed in Canada on December 24, 2023Size: 6QTStyle: Vortex PlusVerified Purchase
It’s great for small loads, if you over fill the basket it takes longer and won’t crisp as fast. It is one of the best air fryers on the market and cooks food perfectly. The functions are easy to use and the preheat function really helps cook the food better.There are some issues with it and primary of those is the smell.  The industrial plastic smell is there for months. The tray is easy to clean but the non stick coating will start to show sign of the coating coming off within a couple months. The anti stick coating is very cheep for such a premium product.

Reviewed in Canada on March 15, 2023Size: 6QTStyle: Vortex PlusVerified Purchase
I had been watching for a lower priced Instant Pot air fryer for a few weeks and finally ordered a discounted returned Instant Vortex Plus 6 in 1 air fryer. Best thing I`ve done for a quite a while! It was delivered on schedule just yesterday. After a good soapy warm water clean and an hour of dry time (I didn`t wash the control panel) - I plugged it in without any food in it, and yes there was plastic odor, let it heat up to 380 for 5 minutes, then shut it off, pulled the pan out, set in aside for 6 hours. Then ran it again empty 2 times, pulled the pan and let it all cool. Not much odor at that point. Then made toast. All good. Then put 4 frozen pork chops in and set on air fry 350 for 10 minutes, Then raised temperature to 380 for 15 minutes. Checking at several intervals to make sure they were not burning, and flipped them half way through. The result was perfectly delicious chops. And so easy clean up. Wipe and rinse. I am used to the controls on an Instapot presser cooker and find the air fryer controls simple and easy to adjust. By the way, this is the 3d air fryer I have had. This one is by far the best ever. Highly recommend this appliance.

Gotta love the Buttblaster 3000
Reviewed in Canada on March 9, 2023Colour Name: Gold and WhiteVerified Purchase
We were away in Egypt, where every toilet had a little built in nozzle at the back of the bowl, and a progressive valve handle to turn on the side.  Very practical, very civilized.  Much better than doing the pants-around-the-ankle waddle to a free standing bidet (what were the French thinking?).When we got home, we started looking for something to replicate that experience.  This model was the cheapest, and had the best description, with dimensions and pictures showing the valve and water channels. Lacking a memorable name, we dubbed it the ""Buttblaster 3000"".This device is just as effective as the built-in models in Egypt.  Flow is easily regulated and the controls operate intuitively.  Powerful enough (if you turn it right up) for a truly memorable experience. Blasts Klingons better than James T Kirk ever could, and it is well targeted to hit the bullseye sitting in a comfortable normal position (at least on our throne). Nozzles retract behind the shield to protect from enemy fire when not in use.Negatives are minor.  According to my wife, the aim of the forward gun is almost the same as the rear, and requires personal repositioning to acquire its target. Its lighter spray is somewhat redundant given the adjustability of flow.  Also why are the provided spacers 3/4"" thick when the device only lifts the seat about 1/4"". Easily solved with some hard foam pad I had around the house.Do yourself a favour, install one on your throne.  Life will be fresher, the sun will shine brighter, you'll save on rash cream and your underwear will thank you.

Reviewed in Canada on September 6, 2023Colour Name: Gold and WhiteVerified Purchase
It was easy to install, however my water shut off started leaking when I turned it back on, so that took some trips to the store to fix it. Not the products fault by any means. The instructions didn't say anything about the 3 plastic shims with peel off sticky on one side. I figured out what they were and where to put them, though I had to remove them twice to get them in a better location to work well. I give four stars because I thought the instructions maybe better if it told you about those and a possible good placement of them. Also new to this world so unsure if it is going to save paper or not, have to dry at the very least with something.

Overall, I think its an excellent product from a trusted brand. Price point was great and I'm very satisfied with the wand quality. However, I've discovered that my personal tastes are for more speed and more intense vibrations.The two speeds are nice, and I will continue to use the wand. Still, I expect that in the near future I maybe on the search for another wand that offers more speeds and increased vibrations (Does Hitachi make one...??). After all, a girl deserves to have multiple wands... :)

Reviewed in Canada on August 24, 2018Verified Purchase
It might look ugly but it works. When I say it works, it's like having a freight train that keeps delivering and delivering. Don't be fooled by all the cordless ones, get this one instead cause when you want to bare down it won't bog out. This has been voted the best adult toy on the market by numerous independent reviews and they weren't lying.My partner used this before we met and was always able to get herself off. Now that we are together I use it on her time and time again. As a guy this is the Snap On tools of adult toys, use it on your partner, pleasure her, let her leave this world while giving her the climax she deserves and craves. It's the gift that keeps giving.

OMG, love this thing
Reviewed in Canada on January 3, 2013Verified Purchase
I bought this b/c I heard many good things about it....and they were true.  B/c it's a plug in, there's so much power to it.  Now I can't use other vibrators b/c they seem very weak in comparision.  My only complaint is that I needed to buy the attachments to hit the right spot, also b/c the vibration is so intense, my hand gets numb from holding the wand.  One you try this, you'd never go back to anything else.  Our sex live has improved significantly b/c I'm more turned on after using the Hitachi wand.  Feels good as a regular massager too :)

Not recommended - Poor quality head
Reviewed in Canada on November 26, 2013Verified Purchase
Not sure if we have the new or old model. But the head of the massager is made of some foam wrapped in a small plastic bag, with some sort of rubber head attached over it. Is this how this product should look? Seems like poor design, as the head does not feel firm at all. Removing the rubber head to clean it already ripped off the underlying layers, what a crappy product. The main reason we purchased this was as a muscle relaxer, but this thing has hardly any decent intensity for working your back muscles, especially as you're not suppose to put pressure on the head according to the manual. Product is already deemed as electronic garbage, will end up in the recycling bin for disposal. All in all not recommended!

Loooved these. If you are looking to cool, hydrate and calm your skin, these are greaaat. They are basically mini sheet masks, super thin and convenient to use. The toner itself sinks in effortlessly, and does not leave your skin feel sticky. 🥰If it’s just to use as wiping, I would say it is worth it.CON: these are made to be refilled. I love tje idea and I wish we could also buy the refills to void unnecessary waste :/

Reviewed in Canada on September 15, 2023
It's a foam flinging minigun. The barrels spin and the fire rate is pretty high, sprays a crazy amount of foam for such an inexpensive blaster. For less than half the cost of getting the Nerf equivalent (Titan CS-50) you get more than twice the fire rate AND a tripod mount. It's great fun, but sadly only comes with 40 rounds worth of its chain, and said chain is not currently sold separately.

Best Sound Profile in TWS
Reviewed in Canada on September 22, 2023Colour Name: Platinum silverVerified Purchase
If it weren't for having the FXM4s, I'd rate this the best TWS product out there.  However, the 4s did have the advantage in 2 areas - better bass/low-end warmth, and better ANC.  I've A/B'd them extensively.  BUT, the new FXM5s have several advantages - form and fit being number one.  Secondly?  The stock sound profile is absolutely incredible - and offers more an ""audiophile"" tuning profile than the warm, fuller XM4s do.  This is not a bad thing - in fact, it's so good - I can't use the GEQ that comes with the new connect app - the stock sound is outstanding.Are they worth the price?  Not if you own the XM4s.  If you managed to see the once-in-a-while 20% discount?  More than likely yes.  If you truly love incredible sound and detail and clarity and precision in TWS format??  Most certainly yes.  The sound and new form make up for all other discrepancies.Note:  Batteries are draining equally between buds, no issues there.  Connect app works seamlessly.  They sound amazing - but they come at a price and they're not perfect.  Yet.

Pros - High quality craftsmanship, good fit, good audio quality, connects to bluetooth quicklyCons - The charging case feels cheap and it seems like the earbuds fail to charge properly at times. Either its that or the battery life of the case dies after one full charge. Also, the surface of these buds are very slippery, so it's prone to fall damage, and they can be tricky to remove from the case.

Every now and then it would happen again but i was able to fix it. This week i spent 3 days trying to fix them...nothing would work..miraculously it started working again, both earbuds were playing at the same time again. Put them back in the case overnight. Next day guess what same issue AGAIN BUT CANNOT FIX IT NOW.  For the amount these cost, i would have expected them to last longer than the one at the gas station and function properly. I was wrong, do yourself a favor and buy another brand. Lets not even talk about sony cust serv. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE.

Sound quality great, battery good, all else not so good
Reviewed in Canada on November 18, 2023Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Sound quality is indeed great, seem good for calls, battery is good but i noticed some weird stuff happening, i will update on that later. Whats annoying is when you take the earbuds out of the box for longer without connecting them or the box is out of battery and  you can't turn them on even though they have battery, so i ha e to put them back in the box to wake them, and if the box is out of battery you have a problem even though they have battery. Thats stupid. The app also acts up with annoying notifications and the touch controls are not as configurable as they should. Some feature are annoyingly useless.Now the worst. The fit is very bad. Although they are very light the fit is based on the ear canal so it's not trustworthy and one tends to stay in a position and the other in another. As mush as i try to push them in, with the right size foams, i can ear them slipping out. I can't feel them secure in place although they never actually came off by them selfs completely, nonetheless its annoying. Also and something that kinda seems on purpose for you to loose one of them and have to buh it again is that the earplugs are very slippery. I mean why would you make something so smal and valuable so polished in a way they can easily slip out of your hands when grabbing them... Seems so obvious that i doubt that wasn't on purpose.For context i previously had the Sennheiser true wireles first edition, the sound quality was pretty much the same as these but the battery was bad and they had a defect that caused the battery to run out in 2 days or less, and they were very bad fo calls. But they had excellent fit and grip. Basically you just put it in your ear and twist it and it locks in place, the more you twisted it the more secure it got, was perfect aside from a litle disconfort that you got used to. I never ever had to ajust them on contraire of these sonys.All in all not worth the money at least untill sony makes a solution for the fit. I only didn't return them because i didn't like the ones from bose and i wouldn't buy the new Sennheiser true witeless because i think they should have sent replacements for a product that was defective.The box from these sonys also feels cheap.I'm a big fan of Sony for a long time but i think they didn't properly tested this ones and the reviews i read were rushed too.

Passive noise canceling of the foam is excellent, even better than a earplug.... except it's uncomfortable to me.  After switching to a silicone alternative (AZLA SednaEarfit MAX standard) there's barely any passive noise canceling left.  Also surprisingly the ANC is very weak, it's heavily reliant on passive noise canceling to block out noise.  There's barely any silicone eartips with mesh on the market.  Noise canceling is next to nothing if you don't use foam.The battery is excellent, 9 hours playtime if I don't use any of the battery hungry settings.  Those are ANC, dsee extreme, and prioritize quality.  The playback hours I'm getting is about 75% of their claimed hours.  Which is still a lot.

Missing 1 of 4 feet, didn't work great for me - keep in mind this is NOT returnable
Reviewed in Canada on April 7, 2023Size: 9 Inch (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
Unfortunately did not meet all the hype for me. It was missing 1 of 4 feet (which if you read other reviews seems to be a common issue) and so would rock and not balance properly. It's very light weight so easy to slide around, and will often get kicked by mistake as it takes up quite a bit of space. I tried this regularly for just over a week and found it didn't make a huge difference for me. I recognize this is something where the experience is going to vary greatly depending on the individuals body type and toilet set up, but personally I didn't not find it was very comfortable nor did it produce great results. It feels cheaply made and make a lot of noise when it gets kicked around (which will happen often since it's quite bulky). To cap this all off, this is unfortunately not returnable, even in spite of the missing pieces. Would not recommend

helped clear up my toenail fingus
Reviewed in Canada on December 14, 2020Verified Purchase
Expensive, but worth it.  This product helped get rid of stubborn toenail fungus that had been around for about a year.  I never really tried other remedies other than persistent cleaning and clipping the nails down to remove the fungal nails at the end.  Several applications needed on dry clean toes, but after a month, with trimming my toenails to cut off the old fungal bits, I looked down it was all gone.  The new toenail growth was clean and clear and pushed out the fungus as it grew and didn't replace any healthy nails with infected bits.  and It also works well on other skin irritations, if I get a flare up of dry itchy skin on my legs in a re-occurring spot, I apply this cream and it reduces redness and itchiness.  I have no doubt that it will work decently for every application that it advertises, as long as your skin type responds normally to the ingredients in the cream.

Intensionally misleading marketing
Reviewed in Canada on October 20, 2023Verified Purchase
The first time I bought this product, I was travelling in the US and the Maximum Strength worked very well.  This time, I purchased it from home on the Canadian Amazon site.There are 2 big issues with this product and the company, both concern intentionally misleading advertizing.The company sells two versions, ""Regular Strength"" and ""Maximum Strength"".  The only difference in the label is that the Maximum Strength version says Maximum Strength in tiny letters in the little red bar below the product name.1.  The product on the Amazon site clearly says Maximum Strength and it's more expensive than the regular, so one would think that are buying the version shown here.  The product I received did not say Maximum Strength.  When I contacted the manufacturer, they said they cannot sell the Maximum Strength version in Canada.2.  The label and documentation shown for this product clearly says ""Maximum Strength"".  However, when I showed the product to some friends and to my Pharmacist, they also thought it was the Maximum Strength because name reads ""emuaidMAX.""  However, because product the name is so large and says ""emuaidMAX"", people don't see the tiny words in the little red bar below it and think they are buying the maximum strength version when they are not.I checked other Canadian pharmacies and websites and they all advertize the same Maximum Strength product as Amazon - however, when I investigated, it turned out that they only carry the regular version.If it's true that the company KNOWS they cannot sell the Max Strength version in Canada, then the only reason I can think of for advertizing it like this is to intentionally mislead trusting people who, because of the label and price difference, believe they are buying what they are seeing.

I cut myself with a chain saw on Friday. Stupid rookie mistake. Everyone can do cross cut..my ring finger got sucked from the bottom and I cut the finger lengthwise. Spent 7 hours at emergency. Solid 4 hours of micro sawing and I left with 20 stitches. As a carpenter I asked how long it’s gonna take to heal.. nurse laughed and said she’ll need to see me in 6 weeks and we’ll go from there but first I need to come back in 6-8 hours to check if it’s not dead. I left white as a wall. Despite warning to keep it clean I applied “only” the blue one right away around stitches. Following day check up asked me “why did you come anyway”.. “it’s all good”..Monday, 3 days later got the red one. Stronger.By Wednesday morning my finger, that got sliced open by 1/4 inch thick 36” chain saw look like someone took a sharpie and draw stitches.So, to recap. By day 1 not black and dead, day 2 no painkillers, day 4 swelling’s gone.It’s day 5am if day 5… I’m drinking my coffee and getting ready for work. Still need to be careful but no pain, no swelling, stitches closed, no open meat and I can almost make a full fist if stitches didn’t hold it back a bit.As I said 50 STARS WORTH PRODUCT !!!!

447,Drysol Clinical Strength Antiperspirant | Available With Best Clinical Strength Protection (20% Extra Strength Solution 37.5ml),4.3,766 ratings,50+ bought in past month,"  STRENGTH PROTECTION: It is the most effective clinical strength antiperspirant available with the best clinical strength protection. Unlike other brands that offer clinical strength protection, the Drysol family of truly clinical strength antiperspirants has always been the market leader in helping patients suffering from excessive sweating.    DRYSOL IS CLINICALLY PROVEN: Drysol is the only clinically proven first-line therapy in Hyperhidrosis and Excessive Sweating. Drysol with Aluminum Chloride Hexahydrate (ACH) reduces perspiration 98% of the time and provides 30% reduction in sweat volume. The regular, so called, “clinical strength” brands can’t compare.    BETTER FORMULATION: Drysol has Aluminum Chloride Hexahydrate (ACH) not aluminum zirconium that is found in most regular so-called “clinical strength” brands. ACH is a larger molecule which is clinically proven to be the most effective active ingredient in forming a plug that blocks sweat output.    BETTER OPTIONS: Only Drysol offers different strengths and formats to use all over the body, not just the underarms that the so-called “clinical strength” brands treat. Excessive sweating can affect many parts of the body with a range of severity. The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) is a diagnostic tool that provides a qualitative measure of the severity of the patient’s condition using a scale of 1-4.    BETTER RESULTS AT A FRACTION OF THE COST: Drysol is the most economical clinical strength antiperspirant in the market today. Apply once a day and then once every 72 hours thereafter. Drysol provides wetness protection within 48 hours, and one bottle can last up to 4 months! Drysol lasts 2-3x longer than the so-called “clinical strength” brands.

Im quite happy with how well this stuff works. I use it on my scalp (against the manufacturers reccomendations) at work due to bad hyperhydrosis. I used to be dripping with sweat from the scalp to the point it would drip onto my safety glasses and damage my hearing aids.  It would happen after doing very little physical labor or just from being in a warm environment. After using this product daily for a week and then once every few days after my scalp almost doesnt sweat at all.Fair warning it does make your scalp itchy after it dries, but it goes away by morning if used just before bed. You will also waste a lot of product as it gets in your hair but it is well worth it for me.

Used this tape on a 3-week trip to Europe where I was walking a lot. It works very well for preventing blisters and rubbing on the balls of my feet and heels, but a few things to keep in mind:1. It is VERY sticky and after a full day of walking around, the glue transfers onto your socks. This doesn't come out well, even after washing your socks.2. The tape is quite hard to take off, but it works better if you shower first so the glue softens in the warm water.3. DO NOT take the tape off too quickly, it WILL rip your skin off-- it's not a bandaid. True story.

I do a lot of canoeing which finds me in and out of the water a great deal with the use of water shoes.  The end result has been the odd blister on the heels of my feet.  Moleskin has been my go to product for years, but in a moisture environment I found it adhering to my skin for only relatively short durations, so always adding more.  A long distance hiker I follow on YouTube mentioned this product as being effective in all conditions, so gave it a try.  His advice was correct, as it stayed where I applied it, even with countless water entries into the canoe.  I have used it on several occasions now, and find it the most effective stuff.  I suppose duct tape could have worked in a pinch, but this is a fabric based product, and I feel its texture works better in what I would call a bandage application environment.

I use this tape to tape my heels for ski touring. I used to use duct tape, but for some reason this year I seem to have an allergy to the glue in the duct tape and it generated cataclysmic feet meat. Also my wife complained the duct tape made a really loud sound in the morning when I was on an early am powder mission.The Leukotape is really nice, I do have to use scissors to make nice strips, but it adheres nicely to my feet. It seems to stick harder the sweatier your feet get, and it doesn't give up. Hot spots in the boots are gone, and no feet meat. Take your time getting it off your feet in the evening, I usually take it off in the shower. Total game changer.

I've been eating Vector for years as the vitamin and mineral content in this cereal is quite high for a mid price product. It's also whole grain. It tastes like any other flake cereal, as it's generally unflavored. My only complaint is that it has 12g of sugar. Less sugar would be nice. Life and Shreddies have less sugar. The 123g of protein listed on the front is when you add milk, as the cereal itself only has 5.7g. But I get my protein elsewhere.

These are tasty! I got them for my son (5yrs) who obviously loves sugary garbage. He wasn’t a big fan but I really enjoyed them.Now a quick note: they have more sugar than a lot of his cereals per serving (12g) but they also have 10g of protein BEFORE you add milk.

            These are tasty! I got them for my son (5yrs) who obviously loves sugary garbage. He wasn’t a big fan but I really enjoyed them.Now a quick note: they have more sugar than a lot of his cereals per serving (12g) but they also have 10g of protein BEFORE you add milk.

New console is big, fast, quiet, and I love it.
Reviewed in Canada on December 3, 2020Verified Purchase
I preordered the console in September about an hour after the Sony event finished streaming and it was delivered to me on November 16.It is certainly a chonk of a console but was very easy to get the stand on (I have it vertical), and setup was very quick and easy. I was soon transferring my saves from the cloud onto the console. It runs very quiet which is great compared to my PS4 which sounded like a small jet taking off.The controller is great. It's a little larger and heavier than the PS4 controller but you get used to it rather quickly. The haptic feedback is awesome and is definitely an interesting sensation. I love the feel of the controller as the textured backing and handles gives a good grip. The built in mic and speaker work just fine, though I still find the sound to be a little on the quiet side, even after maxing out the volume setting and friends say I sound a little echoey.My only issues I had at the beginning were that none of the USB slots worked to charge controllers in standby mode. It would charge fine if the console was turned on but I usually plug in my headset and controller overnight. With the recent update however, this problem has been alleviated and now charges the controller in standby, but I noticed it won't charge my PS4 gold headset in any of the USB ports. I have the dongle plugged into the back and that works but it won't charge, in standby or when it's on. Unsure if this is  glitch or the console doesn't recognkze the PS4 headset hardware?I've only played a few games, currently demon's souls, miles morales, astro's playroom, apex legends, fall guys, and no man's sky. The PS5 games look amazing and now that I have a better console, no man's sky looks and runs so much better. The load times are very quick and jumping in and out of a game are fast and easy.Overall, I love this new console and am very pleased to have purchased it. Not only will new PS5 games be amazing to play but older PS4 games I have yet to play will benefit from various upgrades due to the hardware.

Best system I've ever owned.
Reviewed in Canada on August 5, 2022Verified Purchase
If you're able to get ahold of a PS5, it will be an amazing experience. The graphics are amazing. I do recommend playing it on a 4K or 8K TV as the graphics are fantastic. This version comes with the Blu-ray drive so it's a bit unsymmetrical design due to the drive. It comes with one controller, one HDMI (recommend to use this for best performance), one USB-C wire to charge your controller, and one stand, one power plug. The DualShock 5 controllers is one of the best controllers ever made. It's so comfy in your hands and the haptic feedback gives you a better gaming experience. It also plays PS4 games so you can either trade/sell your old PS4 or put it away for your collection. The PS5 controller works for the PS4 games. Some of the new games give you the PS5 upgrade for the game so you can play both versions and collect double the trophies!

Really happy with Amazon. Delivery was very fast.
Reviewed in Canada on November 17, 2020Verified Purchase
Great work by Amazon. I was browsing the site on the afternoon on launch day and saw the PS5 all of a sudden in stock. Blasted through the ordering process only to find myself with an error saying the item in the cart is no longer available. I tried again a minute or two later and it was in stock again. Then I ran through the checkout process and this time it went through. Later that night it AMAZON charged my card. Two days later, on Saturday, the unit arrived at my apartment building. Was thrilled and everything was good to go.The PS5 itself: Unreal. It's a big boy and takes up a lot of real estate on your entertainment furniture, but it looks really slick. The transition from PS4 to PS5 was seamless and I got playing in no time. The controller is unbelievable and the new haptics are very immersive. I have a 4K television so I am able to take advantage of the the higher resolution. If your TV supports HDR (mine does not), your experience will be even greater.

Amazing console; mute your mic
Reviewed in Canada on December 13, 2020Verified Purchase
The Playstation 5 met all my expectations and to everyone out there who is saying that it is too expensive, I challenge you to build a computer with the same specs at this price. PC will of course always reign supreme due to the customizability and graphics options but for our console warriors this is the definite MUST BUY 'right now'. The games available are super fun and you can play all of your PS4 titles as well. The upscaling is great and although there isn't much for the 4K@120hz content, I did notice some really neat detail differences playing PS4 games on the PS5. It would appear some developers have done some 'behind the curtains' optimization for the new system. I would wait on the Xbox Series X until some of the exclusives come out next year, there's really no point in buying it. But if you can get your hands on a PS5, be sure you do, it's awesome! About the microphone: for those of you who don't know, the PS5 has a built-in microphone in the controller. This is enabled by default, ensure the first thing you do when you get your system is mute it in the system settings.

Reviewed in Canada on November 30, 2020Verified Purchase
The PS5 is one of the best consoles I’ve ever used before. I’m not an Xbox fan boy and I’m not a PlayStation fan boy I enjoy both consoles so this is coming from an unbiassed opinion. Load times a very fast for PS5 games and downloading games is quick and easy. I downloaded the PS4 version of Grand Theft Auto 5 on my PS5 and it only took 20 minutes to download, on PS4 that would of taken at least 2 hours. I’ve only had a couple of bugs such as the console turning off because I was using an external hard drive, and games randomly crashing but these types of bugs are expected early on in a consoles life. Games look great even on a 1080p display and the controller feels great. Overall if you’re able to buy one I don’t think you’ll regret it.

It works for AT2020 USB+
Reviewed in Canada on September 12, 2023Size: 3 MetersStyle: 1-PackCustomer Package Type: Frustration-Free PackagingVerified Purchase
It has only been delivered a few minutes ago but it seems to work perfectly with my AT2020 USB+. It only cost $12 CAD after tax but the quality seems to be okay and most importantly, it works. The thickness is similar to the original cable from Audio Technica. I don't know the durability and how's it like using this in long term but will update it after a few months. I am quite satisfied with this cable right now and I could use my microphone for the works now.I'd recommend this if you are looking for usb cable for your AT2020 USB+. I was on a budget and it was quite a challenges to search for the cheap and good quality usb cable but now I got it.

This belt is fantastic. The material is very high quality and designed to be comfortable on the user. Easy to set up an fits perfect with HITACH MAGIC WAND. The buckles and design are designed with care and it is a very impressive addition to any BDSM fanatics arsenal. The hooks on the sides are great for locking in hand cuffs or tying with bondage rope. Tried both my self and worked like a charge.The female this was used on truly enjoyed it and her feedback was that this is her new favorite accessory.For those wondering if it will fit your partner... the dimensions of my female partner are as follow:pants: 2 regular or 4 petite or 27skirt and dress: size 2 regular or 4 petiteStop looking at this and pull the trigger. Worth the price.

This is a wonderful little deviceThe leather is incredibly strong and it stays in place perfectly (plus you can adjust the hitachi holder which is awesome since my partner and I are two totally different heights)Even the D-rings and attachments are very sturdy (perfect for attaching restraints)The only thing that sucks; If you're over an XL or have a larger waist; this won't fit you at all, the leather's too thick and there's no stretch to it.Either way, I'd recommend this to anyone looking to add a little adventure in the bedroom!

BUY THIS!! 😍
Reviewed in Canada on January 31, 2024Verified Purchase
I’ve been obsessed with the Bum Bum fragrance for a while, but I’m not interested in their pricing. Then I found THIS! While not an exact dupe, the fragrance notes are very similar, and basically half the cost of the big brand. The cream has a dreamy texture, feels super moisturizing and smells frigging AMAZING! It’s like a warm, cozy scent that lasts on my skin all day. Some people feel that the scent is too strong, but I love it. If you’re sensitive to scents this isn’t for you. But if you’re looking for something similar to the Bum Bum scent, you should give this a try! I’ve seen reviews calling the scent ‘floral’ but I don’t agree at all. It’s gorgeous!

Reviewed in Canada on April 19, 2023Verified Purchase
If you are thinking to buy this as a dupe - SAVE YOUR MONEY. That being said. This is a nice cream - it does not smell like coconut or vanilla. It DOES smell like florals and baby powder. It’s a light scent though. Your perfume or body spray will not have to compete with this. It’s a nice thick cream and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy which is nice. It’s overall a good moisturizer. Not the best - but pretty good. All in all I’d recommend this product as it is good value for the money.  Nice to buy a product made in Canada also!

Each segment of the chocolate orange bursts with rich, creamy chocolatey goodness, complemented perfectly by the tangy sweetness of the orange. The flavor combination is balanced and harmonious, creating a truly indulgent experience with every bite.One of the things I love most about Terry's Chocolate Orange is its unique presentation. Shaped like a real orange and divided into segments, it's as beautiful to look at as it is delicious to eat. Breaking apart the segments is a joy in itself, and it adds an extra element of fun and anticipation to the tasting experience.Additionally, the quality of the chocolate is top-notch. Made with premium ingredients and crafted with care, each segment is velvety-smooth and melts in your mouth, leaving behind a lingering sensation of pure bliss. It's evident that Terry's takes great pride in their chocolate-making process, and it shows in the impeccable taste and texture of their chocolate orange.Another aspect that sets Terry's Chocolate Orange apart is its versatility. Whether enjoyed as a standalone treat, paired with a cup of coffee or tea, or incorporated into desserts and baked goods, it adds a burst of flavor and elegance to any occasion. It's the perfect indulgence for cozy nights in, festive gatherings, or any time you're craving a bit of sweetness.In conclusion, I cannot recommend Terry's Original Milk Chocolate Orange enough. With its delightful flavor, unique presentation, and exceptional quality, it's a chocolatey confection that never fails to impress. Treat yourself to a taste of pure happiness with Terry's Chocolate Orange—you won't be disappointed!

These were weird to eat. Yes, they do pop very much like the pop candy. I could even feel near my ear canal and the back of my throat after swallowing as well lol. Though I would prefer the regular without the pop candy. I want my chocolate not filled with these pop candies that give me less of a mouthful of chocolate. They were a fun experience. This would be good for a joke to have set out for those guests that love chocolate.

Not sure what’s happening but I did see a few similar reviews. This formula has some sort of a defect as it was very upsetting to our baby. Went back to the normal version from Walmart of the same brand and it’s now okay. Our baby had an upset stomach for nearly a week and we couldn’t figure out why. Only change was this formula.

My baby has a severe intolerance to lactose and milk protein. He also cannot tolerate the probiotics in the Nutramigen LGG. This is the only formula he can have and is thriving. Yes, it smells kinda weird, but thankfully babies don't have the same taste we do yet! Highly recommend this product.I would like to add an additional comment- for the people who are confused about the 2 different cans, one bigger and one smaller- the smaller can DOES NOT have the LGG added. The scoop is smaller then the can with LGG, so it actually ends up being the same amount of product. There is no ""scam"" with the sizes. They are just slightly different versions of the same product. I still highly recommend if you have baby with dairy issues!

Colic/Milk allergy
Reviewed in Canada on April 7, 2014Verified Purchase
If your infant suffers from colic or a milk allergy, this is what they need. My infant started having long bouts of crying and knees drawn up to his chest when we brought him after being born. After a week of this, I brought him to my family doctor and she said he probably was colic and there really isn't much you can do. My sister bought me Alimentum ready to feed and within a day or two his colic subsided. On day three he started having blood in his stools. After two days of some blood, he was admitted. It was his bowels clearing themselves of his milk allergy. He stayed on Alimentum ready to feed for about two months. I then realized you cannot purchase Alimentum powder form in Canada, so I slowly introduced Nutramigen ready to feed into his bottles (mixed the two). He tolerated the Nutramigen ready to feed so I kept him on this until he was 3 months old. At three months of age, I slowly introduced Nutramigen powder. He is doing great now. If your baby suffers from long bouts of crying it is not normal. Do not listen to your doctor if they tell you you cannot do much for colic. It is worth the money to try them on a hypoallergenic formula. If it wasn't for my sister, I would still be feeding him milk formula. Nutramigen is the best type because it has DHA and ARA for brain and eye development. Alimentum does not have this in their ready to feed and you cannot purchase the powder form in Canada.

Our paediatrician had us switch to this for my son who needed hydrolyzed milk protein because of his allergy. Then my new baby was experiencing colic like symptoms so I just switched to this without consulting the paediatrician and it was very well tolerated! Both babies were on another brand that was sweater smelling/tasting and they had no trouble switching. This one smells like potatoes hahah but if your baby has trouble switching cold turkey mix it with their old formula a little more each bottle. If you’re unsure what I mean then google how to switch a pet to new pet food. :) same idea. :)

I bought this game not to long ago, and had extremely high expectations for it, since everyone seems to be going on about how amazing it was. I was nervous it wouldn't be as good as I was hoping it would, but I was so happy to find out it is. I have a hand cramp from playing it so much. It uses all the features of the Wii remote flawlessly, and it is so much fun to play. It is fairly easy to get the hang of, but still presents a challenge as a game. I would recommend this to everyone that they buy it. It is by far one of the best games out there for the Wii

Amazing machine, but probably only for handy people
Reviewed in Canada on January 13, 2024Colour Name: BlueVerified Purchase
Let me get straight to the point here: Amazing machine, but probably only for technically minded people. What I mean is that it can be hard to set it up properly so that it works smoothly and steadily.FIRST OFF It will shake vigorously (especially in spin mode) so you need to attach it to something firmly. If you don't it will flail wildly and fall off your counter. HOWEVER you should note: There is a way to load the spin dryer properly that makes a HUGE difference! I've noticed if you just chuck stuff into it, it'll shake violently. But if you load stuff so that its lining the sides of the basket, with everything evenly spaced around the sides, it will shake MUCH less. I believe this is extremely important information everyone should know about. It makes a massive difference.Now that being said, I used double-sided tape to attach the feet to something and that is working great for me. However, if you just tape it right to a solid surface connected to your house, it will vibrate that part of your house pretty loudly. So if you're in a cramped apartment building you might not want to do that. What I did is I double-side taped it to a smooth wood board, and then put that on top of an old t-shirt (which is on the counter beside my bathtub). So this way the board can vibrate a lot without making a ton of noise. I also have a shelf on the side so it's impossible for it to fall off the counter - you'd likely also want some kind of extra blocker or support.Once you have it well set up with shake supports and rags or vibration and whatnot, its fine. You can absolutely turn it on and walk away - I have been every day. But I have mine well set up to be able to do so. I can see reviews from other people where they said they can't leave it unattended or they have to hold it the whole time - that's obviously just because they 1) didn't know how to securely attach it down to something to stop the shaking, and 2) didn't know that you have to load the spin dryer basket a certain way in order for it to not shake. Not that people can be blamed for this - the instructions don't even mention any of this.There's also the matter of attaching the hose itself. If you're lucky then the rubber-ended side of the hose will stretch over your bath faucet and it should be easy. But it might not. For me I had to unscrew the bath faucet tip and place the hose inside with a tiny rubber gasket over the hose to make a seal (So its a lot of work to re-attach it if it gets yanked out.. but I live alone and I don't really use the bath faucets.) But anyway keep in mind that it's possible a trip to a local hardware store, to buy little rubber gaskets or faucet adapters, MIGHT be necessary if you want the hose attachment to work properly.So my review is I highly approve, but you should understand what you're buying. If you're expecting a simple ""out-of-the-box"" experience, you might consider looking at one of the smaller and simpler types of these machines. This one is rather heavy-duty as far as portable washers go and thus its gonna require more set-up. But it also washes like a BEAST. This thing gets my clothes so clean it is amazing. The actual process of using it is a joy. Once you have it set up and working it's amazing. But unless you're the sort of person that has an easy time putting together IKEA furniture, this might not be the best fit for you.

            Let me get straight to the point here: Amazing machine, but probably only for technically minded people. What I mean is that it can be hard to set it up properly so that it works smoothly and steadily.FIRST OFF It will shake vigorously (especially in spin mode) so you need to attach it to something firmly. If you don't it will flail wildly and fall off your counter. HOWEVER you should note: There is a way to load the spin dryer properly that makes a HUGE difference! I've noticed if you just chuck stuff into it, it'll shake violently. But if you load stuff so that its lining the sides of the basket, with everything evenly spaced around the sides, it will shake MUCH less. I believe this is extremely important information everyone should know about. It makes a massive difference.Now that being said, I used double-sided tape to attach the feet to something and that is working great for me. However, if you just tape it right to a solid surface connected to your house, it will vibrate that part of your house pretty loudly. So if you're in a cramped apartment building you might not want to do that. What I did is I double-side taped it to a smooth wood board, and then put that on top of an old t-shirt (which is on the counter beside my bathtub). So this way the board can vibrate a lot without making a ton of noise. I also have a shelf on the side so it's impossible for it to fall off the counter - you'd likely also want some kind of extra blocker or support.Once you have it well set up with shake supports and rags or vibration and whatnot, its fine. You can absolutely turn it on and walk away - I have been every day. But I have mine well set up to be able to do so. I can see reviews from other people where they said they can't leave it unattended or they have to hold it the whole time - that's obviously just because they 1) didn't know how to securely attach it down to something to stop the shaking, and 2) didn't know that you have to load the spin dryer basket a certain way in order for it to not shake. Not that people can be blamed for this - the instructions don't even mention any of this.There's also the matter of attaching the hose itself. If you're lucky then the rubber-ended side of the hose will stretch over your bath faucet and it should be easy. But it might not. For me I had to unscrew the bath faucet tip and place the hose inside with a tiny rubber gasket over the hose to make a seal (So its a lot of work to re-attach it if it gets yanked out.. but I live alone and I don't really use the bath faucets.) But anyway keep in mind that it's possible a trip to a local hardware store, to buy little rubber gaskets or faucet adapters, MIGHT be necessary if you want the hose attachment to work properly.So my review is I highly approve, but you should understand what you're buying.

Works great with some tweaks.
Reviewed in Canada on April 8, 2024Colour Name: BlueVerified Purchase
This review would have been a glowing 5-star rating if it weren't for the fill hose issue. Unfortunately, the hose doesn't seem to fit my taps properly, and I'm puzzled as to how it would fit any standard taps. The fill hose itself feels quite thin and flimsy, especially when using very hot water, as it tends to slip out of the washer part easily. To resolve this, I had to get creative and design a custom adapter using 3D printing just to make it connect securely to my taps. Even with this workaround, I still find myself having to hold the hose to prevent it from coming loose at the washer end.On the bright side, the machine performs exceptionally well in other aspects. It efficiently agitates the water, ensuring a thorough cleaning of my clothes. The timer functions reliably, and the drain pipes work seamlessly. The spinner basket effectively removes water, although achieving a balanced load in the spinner can be a bit tricky to prevent excessive machine movement. To mitigate this, I typically place the washer in my kitchen sink for stability and manually support it during the spinning cycle to minimize any excessive vibrations if the load isn't perfectly balanced.

Works well for powering the Switch and charging my phones.
Reviewed in Canada on July 26, 2018Verified Purchase
There isn't much to say about it, it's a USB-C PD charger that let's me take a proper charger with me when I travel without digging in the rats nest of cables around my TV to extract the charger the Switch came with from the dock.  It's clearly made well, you know that no corners were cut in terms of safety (something which I have become more keenly worried about when it comes to no-name chargers without any real certifications), and the price especially when on sale is pretty fair by Nintendo accessory standards considering it can be used to charge other things as well.In fact, this charger charges my phone just as well if not faster than the charger that came with it.  This is particularly nice when travelling because it means one less charger/cable set to pack when you're taking your Switch with you provided your phone uses USB-C and supports USB-C PD.  The actual charger brick is a little bit bigger than most phone chargers but doing double duty makes it worth bringing.The only thing that would have been an improvement is if the charging cable were not permanently attached to the wall wart, which would have made it more flexible for using the cable for other things or changing up the length (no need for such a long cable for travel, for example).

A must get nostalgic system.
Reviewed in Canada on September 25, 2022Edition: SNESVerified Purchase
I was so hyped when they announced this. I had already collected the NES classic edition so this was a necessary get for me. It comes with 2 controllers (big upgrade compared to the NES classic edition, which only came with 1 controller), 1 HDMI, and 1 power micro-usb plug and cable. The controllers are pretty much the same except for the fact that my hands have grown since I last played a SNES system. The 21 games that are included are Contra III: The Alien Wars, Donkey Kong Country, EarthBound, F-Zero, Final Fantasy VI (one of my favourites), Kirby Super Star, Kirby's Dream Course, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (another personal favourite), Mega Man X (one of the best SNES games ever), Secret of Mana, Star Fox, Star Fox 2 (never released in NA before), Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting, Super Castlevania IV, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Super Mario Kart, Super Mario RPG (another favourite of mine), Super Mario World, Super Metroid, Super Punch-Out!!, and Yoshi's Island. Some of these games I've spent hours playing as a kid. It's been super fun just to relive my childhood. Very nostalgic. If you can get your hands on one for a decent price, I would recommend getting it!I can't wait for the N64 classic edition to be released!

Worth it for the Controllers Alone
Reviewed in Canada on October 25, 2018Edition: SNESVerified Purchase
I've been using SNES emulators for many years and they all have shortcomings.  This one works nearly flawlessly.Here are some details about how this differs from other emulators:1.  Emulation is nearly flawless.  That means sprite layers, audio, responsiveness and framerates are perfect.  I only say ""nearly"" because I haven't played through every SNES game completely, and since this is technically an emulator (not using original Ricoh CPU and chipset) there is bound to be some difference.  But I have tested many games - games that others thought worked fine on SNES9X etc. but I found unacceptable.  Everything I have tried works perfectly.2.  Instead of loading a Rasp Pi or other computer and using it's (sometimes) clunky interface, this machine boots instantly to simple, fast game load screen.  Don't underestimate the importance of haste and ease of use.  Gaming is supposed to be fun - not just a novelty hacking project.3.  Controllers are original.  It's difficult to overstate the importance of that.  There are thousands of knock off SNES controllers out there, and none come close to the perfection of this controller.  I could probably fly a space shuttle or perform brain surgery if a SNES controller was my way of doing so.4.  While the Classic ships with only those 21 (mostly good) games, Nintendo has given us all the most wonderful easter egg by making it EXCEPTIONALLY EASY to hack, allowing you to add ANY OTHER GAME YOU WANT.  I did it in about 15 minutes, and I am prone to headaches with such things.  No ugly modified OS - same as stock, but with more games - complete with box art just like the stock games.  Gorgeous.I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, but I do think the SNES is peak of console gaming, and even though it's sad to think that the game industry is so creatively depleted and overrun with adolescent fantasy violence that we are satisfied to hand them money for simply re-releasing their old console, the fact is this system blows all the new systems away.  If Nintendo gave up on new systems and just kept manufacturing and supporting the SNES Classic, that would be a major improvement in gaming.

Great nostalgia trip! Just don't pay more than $100 for one!
Reviewed in Canada on October 6, 2017Edition: SNESVerified Purchase
I was able to buy one where most other retailers were sold out. I did need to have a Prime Membership though but it was available for 10 minutes, enough time for me to sign up to get one. Shipped over the weekend and got it on Monday before noon. Great product even though I already have a Raspberry Pi and it can do 1080p in emulation as opposed to 720p which the SNES CE does.Don't pay more than $100 for this though as there will be more on the way from Nintendo. These scalpers are pretty stupid. They're going to do their best to keep up stock through the end of the year and will also be re-releasing the NES Classic Edition in 2018 but I would rather have this SNES CE. With some technical know-how you'll soon be able to mod it and add more games (including NES games). There is a great selection of games on this (most of which I already own the original cartridges for) and you can't really beat the presentation and the quality of the controllers (although the controller cords, HDMI and power cords could have been a lot longer like the original SNES).The main reason I bought this was to have a legit copy of Earthbound which is my favourite RPG of all time. All that said, if the Super Famicom or European edition of the SNES were available for the same price and the controllers had concave X & Y buttons I probably would have gone with one of those instead simply based on the design alone. One of the strangest omissions in the lineup for this is Super Mario All-Stars and Chrono Trigger (even though I've never really played it), I'm also surprised they didn't include any of the Final Fight games or Super Street Fighter II instead of Street Fighter II Turbo. Wild Guns, Super Double Dragon, NBA Jam, Mortal Kombat II and TMNT: Turtles In Time would have been great to see as well.It would have been nice to have Game Genie or Game Shark support but we all know they're note gonna allow that, especially since they'd have to get permission from companies they've tried to block from selling their products.

I love these games! I only played one of them growing up and never got the chance to play the rest because I was too young when they came out. I'm glad they put out a definitive edition for the newer generation to experience these classics! While they're not at peak performance on the Switch, you would almost ignore the flaws sometimes due to the fun you're having! They could fix the bugs to improve them though but they're great overall!

            We had bought a 36pack boster box of Obsidian flames off Ebay and it ended up being fake cards, after we got refund we decided to get these!It took 1 day for shipping, everything was there and packs not tampered with. No issues, great pulls, so far 8 packs opened got Erica's invitation, charizard, and a couple other holos.Good luck!Jan 16 2024

Fun to open. Regret seeps in after
Reviewed in Canada on March 9, 2024Verified Purchase
I ordered this as a 31 year old man who hasn’t had Pokemon since he was a kid. If you’re looking to just open foil packs, this is actually not a good bang for your buck. I had no use for the oversized mousepad or dice. The new cards aren’t worth anything really.  If I’m being honest, spending this money will get you a few cards “worth” $15-40 but I ended up with maybe half of the 151 characters and 1/4 of the complete set. Great if you like the valueless cardboard box and presentation that goes along with opening this. Strangely Pokémon had this also not come with sleeves

Great for air travel
Reviewed in Canada on April 5, 2020Style: iPhoneColour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
As far as noise-cancelling ear buds go, Bose are the best on the market for sure.  But, there are still limitations with ear buds. I had an off-brand pair before these and they are way better for sound quality, noise cancellation and WAY better for battery life.I use them mostly for air travel. The sound quality is the best, perfectly crisp and rich. When the volume is up, I hear things in songs I've been listening to forever that I never knew were there. They completely cancel out engine noise. They mostly cancel out people talking but I found there are some voice frequencies that get through, though faintly.  Unfortunately, if there is baby crying nearby, that frequency gets through also.  It's much more faint but it's not gone.  Turning up the music fixes this, but I like to keep my music low so I can sleep. This is still much better than any others I've used and I am very happy with them. For FULL noise cancellation, I think you need to go to headphones but I have no interest to travel with those or try to sleep on a plane with them on.  Highly recommend the Bose earbuds.

The best solution for a quiet night's sleep.
Reviewed in Canada on May 14, 2019Style: iPhoneColour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
These headphones are expensive, but oh so worth the price if you value sleep. The noise cancelling is quite amazing and the only solution I've found that can block a snoring partner, loud traffic or noisy hotel air conditioners enough to allow for a restful nights sleep. They are much more comfortable (and more effective) than earplugs and stay in all night. When turned on without input sound they emit a low level white noise, which, it turns out is very relaxing to fall asleep with.The only complaint I have is the control/battery box which is too close to the headphone jack. When plugged in to a device, it dangles awkwardly. Particularly difficult if you are plugging in to a phone that is in your pocket. Since I mostly just use these during the night as noise blockers not plugged in to a device, this hasn't been a big issue for me, but if I used them as my main portable headphones I could see it being one.Battery is good, it easily last me through 2 - 8 hour sleeps.

Some random4.0 out of 5 stars
I like them quite a bit but have some critiques
Reviewed in Canada on February 19, 2021Style: AndroidColour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I come from the world of competitive gaming and these things are pretty essential for anyone playing at the professional level. So I know a lot of people who have them and most people speak really highly of them. I didn't buy them for gaming, however. They can do the job for gaming, but if you want an optimal gaming experience, use a good quality headset.Where these really shine for the average person is if you travel a lot and need noise cancelling. That's why I bought them. I travel a fair bit and these are definitely clutch for travel. Planes and trains in particular, these are really, really good. I don't recommend them for walking around on the street or while driving because you need to hear at those times to stay safe. They are also reasonably useful when you are sharing a space with people having conversations or watching tv. Not perfect, but pretty good. I think it's more just the limitations of active noise cancelling technology these days rather than the QC20s themselves that make them less than perfect for this.For music, I've been pleased with them. Not blown away by any means though because I have a number of pairs of actually really good headphones, both open-backed and closed-backed. These have good noise isolation with the shape of the rubber earbuds and they sound pretty good when they're not 'turned on'. The key thing to note about them is the 'on' switch doesn't just engage the noise cancelling.... it literally enhances the music quality quite a bit. The music becomes louder and the lows are way more prominent. With them 'off', they still sound good and I feel good listening to them 'off'. I can still enjoy music like that, it's just a different experience with them turned 'on'. Music is fuller and richer when they are 'on' and they can sound a bit dull and flat when they're 'off'. The reason I am going on and on about this is because they will potentially run out of battery on you at some point if you leave them 'on' all the time. You could also leave them 'on' by accident and walk away, coming back to a pair of earbuds with no noise cancelling. The reason I bought these over wireless earbuds that are roughly the same price is that even if they do run out, they're still good as standard in-ears. If your wireless earbuds run out of battery you have to put them away and wait for them to charge. If you're in an area where you really could use some music, noise isolation, or to make a phone call, you'll wish you had wired in-ears like these.My main complaints with these are that the sound could maybe be a bit more impressive at this price range, they're sort of an old product at this point and have been on the market at the same price for a LOOOOONG time, and that the earbuds themselves feel a bit cheap and plastic. They buds are super lightweight as a result of this plastic so it's kinda hard for me to hold this against them because the light weight means you can wear them for really long listening sessions comfortably. I just worry that they might shatter at some point by accident. They feel that delicate. I also returned my first pair because I heard something like a spring loose in the right bud when releasing the right side bud after pushing it in my ear. I thought that was a factory defect and that the buds would die on me at some point. The replacements I got have the same issue in the right earbud but it's less pronounced this time so I'm just going to keep them and see how it goes. Not really confidence inspiring on the quality of them, though. I sort of feel like I'm waiting for that right ear bud to die on me.If you've seen the other reviews out there, hopefully this one added to those a little bit. This is by no means a comprehensive review of these things. I just figured I would add a few things that typically don't get covered in the reviews you find on the internet about these things.Overall, I would recommend them for certain people - those that travel a lot and want an uninterrupted listening experience even if the battery dies. I'd also recommend them to competitive gamers that have to wear white-noise headphones on stage to prevent listening to the casters and audience. Those are really the only people who I think will get a big benefit from these.

Useful but with limitations
Reviewed in Canada on January 2, 2024Style: 1packVerified Purchase
The idea of the tag is awesome and definitely helpful to find lost items (or pets, kids…). Because of ita dependency on the iPhone networks I found some limitations in tracking moving targets as the position refreshes slowly. Also if the Airtag is next to someone with an iPhone (which is not paired with) it alerts the iPhone owner that he/she is being tracked…not sure this is very helpful when you are trying to hide that your item (or pets, or kid..) has a tracker. I guess it may be a provision to avoid illegal use of the device. I give it a 4 star because still with these limitation it is quite useful and reasonably priced.

Setting it up was quick and hassle-free. The integration with my iPhone is seamless, making it easier than ever to keep track of my belongings.Functionality: Its primary feature, the tracking and sound-triggering capability, has saved me countless times.

It's comforting to know I have this level of tracking for my most important and often misplaced items.Conclusion: The Apple AirTag is an essential for anyone who finds themselves frequently misplacing items.

This bed is quite comfortable.  Set up is a breeze.  Just unzip and stretch out the frame, plug it in.  Then select your desired firmness, it has 3 levels and turn the dial to inflate.  It’s really very quick about 3 minutes and not overly noisy.  So far the bed has been quite good at maintaining it’s air pressure during the night and having the extra height provided by the frame makes it so much easier to get in and out of bed, especially sleeping beside a partner than a traditional air bed (mattress).  Putting the bed away is also quite easy, turn the dial to deflate, then the sides of the bed fold in on themselves.  Fold up the frame and zip back into the bag.  The bag is roomy and we have found the bed goes back in quite easily.  So far very happy with this purchase.

I have played the original gameboy Yellow Pokemon game, and many that have followed on various Nintendo game consoles over the years. This new game version is everything you can hope for a game to be: storyline, full world exploration, the chance to catch Pokemon from the other versions as well as monthly updates to catch Pokemon or collect gift items that are available through an internet connection, with or without a code (no online Nintendo membership needed). The game currently has a two-part DLC available as well for purchase that expands but adds to this regular version. Many classic favourite Pokemon are found throughout the game, and many new and exciting ones are also available. Game works in Nintendo Switch models, and is easy for all experience levels of game players. Safe and content friendly for young children.

I didn't realize how big this is. I got it to display on a shelf, so it didn't occur to me that it can fit two regular size barbie dolls in it. It is soooo cute! I can't comment on the usability of it since it will only be on display.

Takes a minute to figure out the hand controller , but once done its a breeze. Abit pricey but well worth it . Sturdy enough . Cant wait for her to try it outdoors as it can go pretty fast

Awesome little beast.
Reviewed in Canada on February 20, 2021Style: StandaloneVerified Purchase
Okay I've been using the X2 once or twice a week for the past 2 months. Mostly for skiing, some car stuff, but mostly skiing.The pros:1) Small, compact, and easy to use. I can operate it in the freezing cold with my ski gloves on which has been a huge plus for someone who skis where it's regularly -20C. the screen is easy to navigate and if you set it correctly, it's just a quick button hit to start & stop.2) The Battery - not to drop names, but my other action camera would die in the freezing cold or if it was running at full steam in the sun within 3-5 minutes. This thing? No problem. I've shot 10+min long timelapses in freezing weather and the thing is fine. It's seriously impressive. This was my biggest worry.3) The durability. I've whacked it on trees (wouldn't recommend), dunked it in snow and dropped it onto a cliff off a chairlift (whoops! I'm an idiot). The thing has survived it all. I've broken and fixed the pole more often than the camera. My skis are more banged up than this thing, and they've never seen a rock before.The Cons:1) The videos take a long time to edit. I do it on my phone because the phone app is much better than the computer app. I have experience with video editing so it's not too too hard, but I can see it being challenging for some. Going into 360video though, you should expect to spend more time on editing than regular videos. There are way more possibilities with 360 post-process reframing, but it will take time.2) When in low light, stills from videos will not be that crisp, and you should expect that. The stills from videos in bright light are fantastic (seen in the last 2 photos posted) but low light isn't GREAT.Overall - I would 100% recommend. It's an incredible little camera and for the price it can't be beat!

Nice camera but…
Reviewed in Canada on March 18, 2022Style: StandaloneVerified Purchase
This is a very nice camera but unfortunately I cannot seem to find support from them in Canada. It’s seems hard to be able to get in touch with them and there doesn’t seem to be a lot of videos out there on other platforms were troubleshooting is addressed. A lot of the videos are fun to watch but when you are stuck with something that you do not know how to do as it is a little bit of an advanced camera it’s just hard to get information or help. Other than that it’s great and I love the 360 feature but I hope that I am able to find the answers to the questions I have in terms of troubleshooting. If Insta 360 wants to sell to Canadians and get their business as they have with me, they really must provide technical support customer service to their customers.

Fun camera to use
Reviewed in Canada on March 18, 2021Style: StandaloneVerified Purchase
Edited to add that the insta360 support team is very responsive and quite helpfulIt's a really fun and simple camera to use - just hold it up and don't even have to worry about the direction it's pointing at.The editing in app is also fairly straightforward to use - I use the iPhone and iPad to edit the clips and it works fine. What I like most is that you can reframe after you film, all the different angles quite easily.Battery life is pretty good - I don't worry about not having enough juice for a whole day shooting, and I just bring a battery pack in case I need to recharge while shooting.My one complaint is that the voice command seems very finicky, it stops recording thinking you said ""stop recording"" even though no one said that - I had to disable this feature, which is unfortunate as this was one of the main features I was looking to use.  A word of caution, please ensure you test this out before the amazon return period runs up, I have just missed the return period by a few days as I was dealing with technical support, and it looks like I will have to send the unit back instead of using the quicker amazon exchange.

Reviewed in Canada on June 23, 2022Style: StandaloneVerified Purchase
I have used this product for 2 months on my motorcycle as a second camera to motovlog with. The camera is amazing. I had an issue with video quality on sunny days, which was quickly fixed. I chatted with a support person on the 360 studio app. I was so happy with the instructions I got and how I was guided through the settings to get the max video quality. Hi five guys. I was also instructed to leave the chat window open in the program and test my cam for a day or two and return with the results to see if more help was needed. Yes you can shut off your computer and the chat is still there when you go back into the studio program.I do hope in future cams, there will be an option to zoom in hi quality.

Great camera, so-so app
Reviewed in Canada on August 31, 2021Style: StandaloneVerified Purchase
The camera itself is fantastic, great picture quality, solidly built, plenty of accessories, pretty easy to use and intuitive.. love that it blurs out the selfie stick, makes for some wild videos/pictures that leave people scratching their heads, although it sometimes leaves a very visible line where it tries to 'stitch' the video together and somewhat ruins the shot.The app (iOS) on the other hand, is borderline unusable at times, it's crashed many times on me, takes forever to render videos, has a steep learning curve, the AI doesn't always allow you to move the view as you'd like, forcing you to make multiple view point changes to get the desired effect. It's a real pain in the nuts at times.. Not to mention their PC software is hidden behind a paywall and I couldn't get the free version to work, despite having a powerful gaming PC.I wish editing didn't use AI all the time, I want to be able to manually pan the camera and do things without AI analyzing and doing it for me.Do your homework, look up many videos on how to use the app and the camera is worth it. That goes for all 360 cameras, but especially so ANY Insta360 ones..

Hysterical!  The name makes it sound like an adult game, but it's not, I mean yes adults AND children can play. You have your key word that you can't say, let's say Pacific Ocean, but there's a list of words you can't say, for instance, like ocean, Atlantic, seawater, seas, water. So trying to describe it is really funny, the word 'aqua' gets used alot, lol. It is usually played in pairs, so we came up with a three person version, because you need one to say the clues, and two people to guess, so to make it fair, the clue person and the right answer person both get a point.

I wish it had the little hard holders that the older version had, or maybe this is the old version, I don't know. When I played it before there were card holders separate from the plastic of the box itself, which was useful. This does have a spot integrated into the box, which is fine, but it's just more convenient to have it separate. This is still just as fun as I remember it, though!

It's not wireless
Reviewed in Canada on August 13, 2023Style: HW-Q910B/ZCVerified Purchase
If you are considering purchasing this wireless sound system, please take note of some specific details regarding its connectivity. Although labeled as 'wireless,' the system does require connections between the bass and the soundbar, which is reasonable. However, the rear speakers must be connected to a central unit that also requires a power connection to the wall. While these speakers do not need to be connected directly to the front system, the use of the term 'wireless' may be somewhat misleading. Buyers should be aware of this aspect to avoid any misconceptions regarding the product's true functionality.

Awesome sound out of the box.  Your ears can be tricked into thinking you are surrounded (pun intended) by speakers, especially with correct surround speaker positioning and proper room acoustics.  It can't compete with the Klipsch 7.1 - JBL Synth in my TV/Music room, and I did not expect it to.  The concept, price point and specs make it an uneven match.  But in my smaller man cave/home office of 12ftx11ft?  Whoo-aaah! this Q990B packs a wallop, a powerfully detailed wallop.My only complain is the teeny tiny display on the front that you can hardly read because it is behind the grill.  Functionality and practicality sacrificed for aesthetics.  Are you kidding me?  This model has a very industrial/utilitarian looks to begin with, you can't make it chic by hiding the status display, c'mon, Samsung.  Kinda like putting a tiny Hello Kitty Bobblehead doll on the dash of an army green Hummer.  SMH.I did not experience any electrical dysfunction or premature disconnection of surround speakers.This model raised the bar for future soundbars to clear.  Highly recommended.

It came in a brown cardboard box that is sealed.  The quality of the product is good, it is better than expected.  It is sturdy and overall works well.  It works properly with Windows 10 machines.  It works with TV and monitors.  It will transmit audio and video to the HDMI port.  It is a passive adapter, so if you need an active converter, this may not work for you.Overall, it seems like a good value, especially if it's on sale and it's less than $10.Pros: - Good price and good value, especially compared to other retailers - The quality of the cable seems nice.  It seems to built to last. - Works with both TV and monitors. - Works with Windows 10 without any driversCons: - Passive adapter.  Not really a con, but if you need an active adapter, you should get some other product.

I was originally using a display port adapter to HDMI and then running an HDMI cable. The adapters would wear out every couple of months. Take the adapter out of the picture and use this cable. It's solid and does exactly as it should.

Fantastic mic however by no means recommended for everyone
Reviewed in Canada on August 24, 2022Style: SM7BVerified Purchase
Beware:If there's anything I've learnt by using this mic is that it's not for everyone. Nor is it for anyone who understands it's purpose and how it works let alone the little caveats that come with it. This is a studio grade mic. It's expensive. It requires you to know what you are doing to set yourself up properly for your intended use. By no means this is an entry (plug and play) mic for anyone out there, even less so for anyone who intends to use it for commentary (looking mainly at all of you who want to make youtube videos and streams). Do keep in mind that this mic shouldn't ever be your first pick, not at this price point and not without a good knowledge because you will be disappointed.If your intentions are to do commentary and broadcast, there are far more affordable options that you can tweak to sound like this one.If your intentions are musically inclined then this may be a better option for you however not the first either.In any case keep in mind that this is a VERY quiet mic, it takes a good amp to drive it. It's not a plug and play mic, you have to EQ it to your intended use (not that you can't just use it as is, just won't give you the results you are seeking). It certainly is very pricey due to the quality, branding and popularity - there may be just as good options out there for you to look at.Actual review:I've tried and used a fair share of mics for various purposes and went up the ladder until I could finally buy this one. All I can say is that it's damn worth it. In the year or more I've had it, it served me fantastically and I genuinely can't find any complaints. When it comes to music, this thing makes all the instruments I've used pop which is a pleasure to listen to. Highly suggest this product but only if you read what I've said up there in the beware.

Amazing microphone! Great upgrade from the AudioTechnica AT2020.
Reviewed in Canada on March 29, 2024Style: SM7BVerified Purchase
I was using my AudioTechnica AT2020 for 2-3 years, and it did the job perfectly. However, I did hand it off to a family member, and settled to finally trying out the Shure SM7B I had heard so many great things about. Not disappointed at all!The quality is amazing. I had watched a few videos to compare it to other ""high end"" microphones, and it is difficult to see the difference at that level, but I still wanted to make the move for a microphone with an amazing reputation such as this one. I set mine up with a Scarlett Focusrite 2i2 4th Gen interface, and, so far, it's been amazing! Any ""issues"" that I thought I was having were easily fixed by simply googling about it and watching a few YouTube videos to help me set it up properly. Greatly recommend!If you are having the same issue I was with it only playing in the left channel (left ear) alongside a Focusrite Scarlett interface, make sure to try out the following steps:a) Download your audio interface's drivers, as well as Focusrite Control 2 (at the time of writing this).b) Restart your PC.c) Go to your Windows Sound Settings.d) Go to Recording.e) Find your microphone (i.e. Analogue 1 + 2), right-click it and go into Propertiesf) Go to Advanced and change it to 1 channel rather than 2 channels (I personally use 24 bit, 48000 Hz (Studio Quality)).If that did not work, good luck troubleshooting!

It's amazing.
Reviewed in Canada on January 16, 2021Style: SM7BVerified Purchase
From what I read, the only negative reviews are from people who have zero or very little knowledge of how a microphone works. It's actually embarrassing to see their ""review"" and to have so many ""helpful"" likes on them. The mic is incredible. I use it for recording YouTube videos. In order from my mouth to the computer I have the SM7B on the PSA1 boom arm connected to an XLR cable connected to the Fethead connected to the Focusrite 2i2 which connects to my laptop. Some people claim the Fethead should be connected to the mic side but it makes no difference at all. When called out about this, they say it's not the Fethead's fault but cheap XLR cables. So I plugged in some Amazon Basics XLR cables and it works fantastic with the Fethead on the Focusrite side. People like to just spew non-sense for the fun of it. One piece I didn't mention is the Shure A26X 3"" Extension Tube. I have this hooked up between the mic and the psa1 boom arm. This piece is optional but if you search for that piece on YouTube, you will see why you may like to have it. I paid around $20 Canadian for it. The mic sounds absolutely fantastic for professionally made YouTube videos and cuts out a lot of the background noise. I also had the SM57. The background noise is about the same but the quality of the SM7B is better. It also gives you options to help make it compliment your voice unlike the SM57 or SM56. Those are both fantastic mics, but you can't beat the SM7B and it looks so much cooler than having that massive ugly grey windscreen on it that you have to buy for the SM57. Just take the cash hit and invest in this setup. It's brilliant.

Launched my audiobook narration career!
Reviewed in Canada on March 26, 2022Style: SM7BVerified Purchase
Where do I begin?  This mic is legendary, and that signature, warm rich sound capture is what I believe launched my audiobook narration career! I have a mid range, rather sibilant and naturally plosive  voice. I tried a lower priced podcast style mic, but it didn’t really complement my voice, even with eq and enhancement during mastering.I was not getting any response to my auditions, so after himming and hawing about the price, and reading endless reviews here and elsewhere, I pulled the trigger and bought this mic.Wow! A match made in heaven! This mic was made for my voice. I started recording auditions with it, and bam! I got my first audiobook job, with several other interested offers! Was it the mic, and its signature warm sound that complemented my voice?  Maybe.. !You will need a cloud lifter like a Fethead, which I use to get some real good gain into your interface.This extra gain keeps the noise floor down, so you don’t have to ram the levels up to get good db into your daw.Also, this mic has amazing emi and rfi rejection.  Very low noise, compared to the lower priced podcast mic I used previously, which I had to remove hum noise from in post with a denoise plugin. Even in less imperfect recording areas with some room reverb, this mic can tame that. Great background rejection.Love this mic, thanks Shure! Awesome product.

This method will only work if your nintendo network id is linked to the current nintendo account system. If you haven’t linked it before the service was shut down it is unfortunately no longer possible to do so and this card will not work !However i own a nintendo switch so i just used the money to renew my yearly pass no money loss. Im writing this to prevent people from thinking this might work for them when it wont.Aka before buying this for a nintendo 3ds verify that your accounts are linked.otherwise great product. works !

From 9600k to this.
Reviewed in Canada on March 29, 2024Verified Purchase
Words cannot describe the change in performance.I thought my 9600k was still a decent chip before I upgraded. Now I see although it was decent, I was missing a lot. My rtx 2080 super didn’t get upgraded this year but I’m sure it’ll need to by next year as it’s now always peaked at 100% in games. While my gpu works a sweat trying to not burn itself to the ground, this 13600k sits around 20-30% usage and around 50 degrees Celsius in most situations.Depending on the motherboard, you may want to tweak “CPU lite load” settings. My MSI mobo defaulted to mode 12 and was causing overheating issues due to current. Now dialed back to mode 9, I have lost no performance what so ever, I actually gained almost a thousand extra points in cinebench by not letting it get hot.Overall I’m very happy and would highly recommend this cpu to anyone.

I bought this phone because mine broke after ive accidently put it in the oven (be carefull with magnetic cellophone cover when you are cooking haha).The cellphone looks good. Not too much scratch except at the bottom.I cannot tell much about battery life so far because theres is a lot of updates to do (thanks -not- android for the non cumulatives updates!!!!) so the battery is draining fast but its one of the effects of doing a lot of system updates.... At least the charging is fast.I will try to come back to update my review in 3 months to check if I am still having issues with the battery life.

The device came in a bare box that was unsealed except for two small pieces of tape at one end.  It did not have a charger, although a charging wire was included.  There was no manual, no documentation, no warranty.  Nothing in this package would indicate it was a brand new device - never used.

Worse than Samsung Galaxy S10?
Reviewed in Canada on October 18, 2023Style: S22Colour Name: BlackSize: 128Verified Purchase
I upgraded from an S10 to this and honestly don't notice much improvement. Almost feels like a step backwards in some ways:-  The face recognition is a nice feature when it works, but since I wear hats it tends to throw off the face recognition feature. Nonetheless I do really like this feature and am hoping on newer models they will work to strengthen this.- The fingerprint scanner I can't comment too much on since I put a tempered screen protector on my phone because with my S10 I broke the screen when I dropped it and that's why I had to upgrade. So I didn't want to go through the same ordeal with this phone and opted to protect the screen. I think this is making the fingerprint scanner a bit shoddy so opted for facial recognition to reduce dependence on this.- I feel like the battery life is the same as the S10 which was disappointing since I was hoping this generation would be slightly better. I'm even questioning if maybe the battery life is worse?....but maybe there are some new apps working in the background I'm unaware of that are draining the battery. I also find it takes a bit longer to charge than my S10. They didn't include a phone charger (only the USB-C cable), but I do still have my charger from my S10 so I use that to charge this phone. I really hope Samsung and Apple start including chargers back into their phones again. They seem to really be cheaping out on their phones while forcing us to pay more for less.- The camera quality is definitely better than the S10, but can't say if it's worthwhile enough to switch to the S22 if your S10 is still going strong.- They removed the headphone jack and also does not come with a pair of headphones.....again Samsung and Apple are cheaping out again and forcing consumers to pay more for less.- I really miss the heart rate sensor from my S10. They removed this from all models going forward (S20, S21, S22, & S23). I really enjoyed this feature since I suffer from a bit of anxiety and I would use the heart rate monitor to measure my heart rate when I was feeling anxious and then focus on my breathing to bring it down. This has saved me in so many social situations and it's really unfortunate they decided this was worth removing going forward in order to push their terrible smart watches that no one wants.Overall I am not too impressed with this phone but am hoping it will at least last me 3-4 years and hopefully by that time Samsung is able to deliver a phone that feels like a true upgrade and maybe even bring back the heart rate monitor…..please.

Reviewed in Canada on March 12, 2024Size: Ancestry ReportsVerified Purchase
Yes I found my family history using the DNA test,... What I was made up of. But even more surprising is that I found a second cousin that my family never knew existed.  We though her dad never had children.  Even better - I moved hundreds of miles away from my hometown .., and that is where she lives. Only 15 min from me. We have already met.  This test is totally worth it because you might just be able to find a new family member or answer questions for someone else!

However, Ancestry.ca will try to convince you to subscribe to their service.  I didn't, but son has a full subscription.  It is astonishing when you find out who your distant relations are.

Battery is a little bit poor, but otherwise works great
Reviewed in Canada on February 1, 2023Verified Purchase
I was pretty skeptical about buying a refurbished phone on Amazon, but pleasantly surprised when it came in good condition and worked well. I've had it for a couple of years now, and my only complaint is that the battery life is quite low. I'm not sure if that's a result of a damaged battery or just the phone itself having a small one, but either way I don't deem it to be much of an issue if you aren't a heavy user.

Ordered 2 of these phones. Both looked great, only one worked properly. The other had a clearly defective headphone jack. Virtually no sound came through.Sure, I can get a refund but I'm still without a phone until I can get a new one. More quality control would be better.

Do not buy from this company
Reviewed in Canada on December 16, 2022Verified Purchase
Horrible product on multiple occasions. I am not one to leave reviews, but be careful with this seller. On the first occasion I was sold a product that has a horrible battery life, so it was replaced.. by a phone with even worse battery life. This phone will not even last 12 hours on low brightness with minimal use, and dies even faster in the cold. No compensation provided for my hassle after only 4 months of owning the phone, no refund at all. Do not buy from this seller.

It's expensive...but I think it's definitely worth it if you have the budget!
Reviewed in Canada on January 24, 2021Verified Purchase
It's been a while since I've used an XBOX controller (still have my XBOX 360), but after picking this up, I immediately remembered why I loved using these controllers over PS's Dualshock: the build quality and the heft. To be fair, I'm making comparisons to the DualShock 3 on my PS3, and things have probably changed since then, but there's is still a noticeable difference.First off, the weight of this controller really gives it a substantial feel in the hand, so it doesn't feel like you're holding a flimsy piece of plastic in your hand. Second, the hard, rubberized soft-touch plastic that they use is REALLY nice in the hand, and while I think it'll eventually wear out with heavy use, it still feels way better than any PS controller I've ever held. As for the buttons and joysticks, they also carry on the sense of quality. The joysticks are rubberized and have a knurled design on them which helps with grip and the concave design means your thumbs won't slide off them very easily. The triggers feel like you're pressing INTO them rather than just pressing them like conventional buttons, which feels cool with FPS and arcade games. Even though I don't use the metal triggers on the bottom, they do feel nice and it's convenient if I ever need to use them (which I will eventually when I start playing more PC games)As for battery life, I started using it out of the box and so far it's still not dead, so I trust that this controller won't die quickly. The case that comes with it includes an extra set of controls to switch out the default ones, as well as a magnetic stand that holds the controller in place, which is very fancy dancy!As for connectivity, there's definitely latency or delayed input between pressing a button an it registering on the screen when using Bluetooth, but it's not enough to distract or bother me to the point where it becomes unplayable. If you think it'll bother you, I suggest getting the XBOX Bluetooth adapter, since I've heard online that it does help a bit with latency (or just plug it in directly to your PC/XBOX).Extra niceties: it uses USB-C for charging and connectivity, so if you already use USB-C for your phone (or in my case, my phone and my laptop), you can rest easy knowing that you don't always have to carry the included cable with you (I personally use an existing USB-C to USB-C cable when plugging the controller into my laptop).NOTE: make sure you update the controller via plugging it into your PC if you're going to use this on your Android phone. If you immediately connect it you your phone the first time without updating it, the buttons won't be properly mapped to your game, but instead will navigate around your phone (exit the game, change apps, open the Search bar, etc.).

Awesome controller
Reviewed in Canada on December 22, 2023Verified Purchase
Awesome controller.  Has a nice ""heavy"" feel to it.  Being able to customize the buttons with multiple profiles is quite nice as well.  Love the charger & case, really convenient.  Charge seems to last a really long time as well.Occasionally I accidentally hit the paddle buttons, but this is a pretty minor quibble.What's a more annoying thing is you can't program other buttons to be the back button on a normal Xbox controller.  I play Rock Band a lot, and overdrive is deployed by pressing that back button, so I'm still stuck with using the actual back button on the controller instead of being able to reprogram it to another button.  TBF it's not mentioned in the description that you can program buttons to be the back button, so fair enough, but still annoying.

A great controller, but the build quality is absolutely Abysmal
Reviewed in Canada on November 5, 2019Verified Purchase
Edit* I would not recommend buying this controller. I am currently trying to get my second one replaced, and they are not responding it under warranty. These controllers do not last longer than 6-8 months before you have stick drift or button failure issues. Disappointed in Microsoft for their build quality and support quality.I received my elite controller yesterday morning, as usual, Amazon's shipping is great!This review is going to be aimed more at those who owned the original Elite Controller. Although I'll try and make it work for everyone.For some context, I have had multiple of the original elite controllers. I didn't have any of the issues with the bumpers breaking or the grips peeling. My issue was the sticks starting to drift. My first one lasted me a year and a half, then the second one I had replaced via the warranty after about 8 months. I sold the third one a few days before I received this one and it was still working fine after about 14 months.This controller feels SOLID. The last one felt pretty good compared to regular controllers, but this one feels amazing compared to even the original elite controller.Let's start with the new features.My favorite thing about this controller over the original elite controller is the charging dock. You can remove it from the carrying case for those wondering. I have it sitting on my bedside table so I can have my headphones plugged into it while I watch TV late at night. Now my controller will be fully charged at the beginning of every day!The new adjustable tension in the thumbsticks is pretty fantastic. I no longer over compensate my aiming as much when I'm playing a FPS! It is super easy to adjust with the provided tool, however if for some reason you lose it, you can adjust it with something you find around the house like a tiny screw driver or maybe even a steak knife.The third profile that they added will be nice. I'm sure I'll start playing more than two games at some point... But even if I don't, maybe I'll set up a multi media profile, which leads me to my next point.The new paddle functions! Like the original elite controller, you can customize what button does what and remap different buttons. However, there are a couple of new functions with this! You can now map functions such play/pause, record and screenshot, and even volume control of the TV.With these new paddle functions, they also added the ability to map a button as the shift key. This allows you to map a second button to each function.The paddles themselves seem to be a lower profile than the original elite controller. They don't stick out as far and they are more comfortable in your hands.The only con for me so far, is that the joysticks they provided don't all have two. The dome top thumbsticks and the tall thumbsticks only have one of each, so you can't put two on your controller.The provided USB type C cable is great quality aswell.Overall, I'm very please with this controller. At $230 dollars it will not be worth it for most people to buy. However, if you think the price tag is worth it for a exceptional controller, then you will not be disappointed.

Reviewed in Canada on April 4, 2024Style: PA120 SEVerified Purchase
I usually dont write reviews, but I felt that sometimes when you come accross a product that works excellently, and comes with a reasonable price tag, the manufacturer deserves a good review.Note, that those new to building a PC that this comes with thermal paste, so no need to buy more.  This product does a great job cooling my CPU (13th gen intel) and as I am writing this, it costs about $42 CAD.The only small gripe is that the instructions in the box aren't great, and the mounting bracket is not as simple as it could be, but still extremely easy even for a beginner.  I would say that anyone installing something like this for the first time, google a video for installation, its much easier then the instructions.Overall this product is a 5/5.  Hope this helped somebody decide on this cooler.

Wow, THE BEST bang for your buck
Reviewed in Canada on June 21, 2023Style: PA120 SEVerified Purchase
I recently built my PC and opted to go with a much cheaper alternative to something like NOCTUA and I couldn't be more impressed. This powerful air cooler not only delivered exceptional cooling performance but also added a touch of elegance to my system's aesthetics. The most notable aspect of the Peerless Assassin 120 SE is its outstanding cooling capability. It comes equipped with six heat pipes, and boasts effective and efficiency. It dissipates heat from the CPU, keeping temperatures well under control even during intensive tasks and overclocking.One of the standout features of this cooler is its remarkable build quality. The solid construction and attention to detail are immediately apparent. The black nickel-plated heat sink with its sleek design not only adds a premium look to my rig but also enhances the overall airflow efficiency. It seamlessly blends with any build theme, providing a visually pleasing and cohesive appearance.Installation was a breeze, thanks to the user-friendly mounting system. Thermalright has clearly invested in designing an intuitive installation process, allowing even novice PC builders to effortlessly install this cooler. Applying the Thermal Paste of your choice couldn't be easier aswell! The comprehensive installation instructions provided further simplified the setup, ensuring I had the cooler up and running in no time.Another aspect that impressed me was the low noise operation of the Peerless Assassin 120 SE. The included 120mm fan runs quietly while maintaining excellent airflow, contributing to a peaceful computing experience. Even under heavy loads, the fan noise remains at an unobtrusive level, allowing me to focus on my work or immerse myself in gaming sessions without distractions.In conclusion, the Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE CPU Air Cooler is an exceptional cooling solution that combines impressive performance, stunning aesthetics, and ease of installation. Its robust build quality, efficient heat dissipation, and quiet operation make it an excellent choice for any PC enthusiast or professional user. If you're looking for a reliable air cooler that delivers outstanding cooling performance while enhancing the visual appeal of your system, the Peerless Assassin 120 SE is a top-tier option that won't disappoint.(Note: This review is based on my personal experience with the product and may vary depending on individual preferences and system configurations.)

Great cooler, great price!
Reviewed in Canada on March 19, 2024Style: PA120 SEVerified Purchase
Installed this to replace the Wraith Spire cooler for my R5 3600, brought the temps right down to normal! Keeps idle temps around 35C in a 22 degree room at 20% fan speed, which is nearly silent. Under full load, fans at 100%, keeps temps below 60C. All of this using the included thermal paste, so don't bother with any other brand of paste unless you really need the extra 5% dissipation. Only complaint is that the springs on the mounting bracket make it hard to feel if you've caught the screw or not, if the studs on the bracket were another 5mm the studs could catch without compressing the spring and make it much easier to install. But since every cooler is like that, can't complain. 10/10 cooler! Will update in a month or so if the performance degrades.

Great budget CPU cooler - some noise issues
Reviewed in Canada on October 26, 2023Style: PA120 SEVerified Purchase
Cooler itself works very well, my CPU temps are kept well within range (i513600K). That being said, I believe one of the fans is defective. There is a whirring hum noise when it gets up to speed, normally over 1300 RPM which with how my fans are set up it reaches that easily while gaming. It is not a huge deal for me as I do wear headphones and at idle it isn't loud, but if you are sensitive to noise maybe spend a bit more.

Great flag
Reviewed in Canada on June 30, 2020Verified Purchase
unique, good show of solidarity between two great countries. Bank on it lasting about 1-2 years depending on the climate you are in. We have some good wind and cold weather here in the winter so after 1.5 years it started to fray at the ends- but it's cheap enough to keep 3-4 in stock.

Buyer Beware!!!
Reviewed in Canada on September 26, 2020Verified Purchase
I cannot recommend this seller- I also HAD to give them one star. The quality is Awful, and not what was advertised. The flag appears to be hand made. it is one sided and the stars are blurry as with the printing on the maple leaf. the grommets are not placed in the appropriate spots and the edge is not sewn straight. Not something I would personally display. Aside from this the seller didn't want to give a refund, they were wanting me to wait and then offered a 30% discount then a 40% discount.  After several attempts to resolve this issue I contacted AMAZON support and was refunded the purchase price.

Reviewed in Canada on March 16, 2024Verified Purchase
It's a very reasonable priced firestick. You can also get a lot of additives downloaded onto it. If you have the time and patience for it. I remember going on YouTube and figuring out how to get new movies in theaters to be installed on it. You can also get different news from all over the world as well as shows.It is a really cool device and you should purchase it of you have some time on your hands to watch a movie or two with your family or friends. I recommend getting two if you are generous enough to add the movies and give it to a significant other or a friend as a gift. An of course one for yourself, it's a must get if you love shows and movies, an you can get all kinds of different programs from across the world, even your home country just take the time to learn how to do it and you won't be sorry.

Is it worth upgrading from prior Regular 1080pFireSticks?.... YES! A+
Reviewed in Canada on October 15, 2021Verified Purchase
I almost find this hard to believe but this is now my 6th FireStick! My first trial experience with Amazon Smart and Streaming products was picking up a regular FireTV Stick along with an HD8 Tablet when on sale during the July 2019 Canada Prime Day and we now have these all over the house in addition to the “regular” 1080p one I first purchased in 2019 which is now at a weekend property. I recently also picked up the brand new 4K “Max” variant for my main Home Theatre, but that is a lot more money than this 4K version. I wanted this Stick being reviewed to retire that original 2019 one and have a better 4K version of the stick to replace it. That brings us to the question “is THIS another new 4K version”? Well, it is and it isn’t.....I was a bit confused when I first saw this listing as it appeared around the same time as the launch of “Max” but there is also another 4K Firestick listing that is several years old (with 30,000+ reviews on it!) I thought, is this one another NEW 4K stick I was not aware of? Well, after scrutinzing all the specs and details, this version appears to be exactly the SAME as the other 4K listing (from what I can tell) other than the fact that it has been refreshed with a updated Alexa remote that now also has 4 dedicated “1-click” access buttons for certain services. My current 4K sticks released several years ago have the “normal” remote (see comparison pic). I will touch on this refreshed remote control first....I now find I really like the newly redesigned remote! It’s still very familiar with the same same size and footprint of my prior remotes, but at first glance I was actually annoyed by the inclusion of the quick access buttons for 4 pre-set services as these are set in stone and NOT changeable to something else. But then I thought these are services I ACTUALLY USE!, so its very convenient for my household. The 4 hotkey buttons are for direct access to Prime Video, Amazon Music, NetFlix and Disney+. I believe that US 4K Sticks have a “Hulu” button in place of Amazon Music button on the Canadian retail version, but that would make sense as Hulu is now a huge service down South.Well, so how about this newer 4k Stick “Refresh”?... Keep in mind that I am really just basing my comparison on “upgrading” from an older regular 1080p only FireStick which is what I am doing here. There are some extra benefits from going from a 4K the new 4K “Max” as well, but the Max is $30 more so it is hard for many to justify that price point difference. So, lets look at this “newish” 4K Stick...This 4K stick basically includes all of the same accessories as prior FireSticks. You get a USB power cord with a charging wall/power brick, an HDMI extender dongle (which is very handy in situations where you need to reposition the stick due to space issues in the back of you TV, batteries to power the remote, and the refreshed Alexa enabled remote as already noted.SetUp is very easy as with all prior generation FireSticks. Once pluggIed into power and you turn on your TV you will be met with the Update screens within a few moments. You just need to take a few minutes to follow the simple on screen prompts to log into your network for the first time, and then after entering your Amazon account details the updates will complete and you will be given the option of sending over all the apps you already had setup on your prior Sticks. You will also be able to set it to work to your TV in moments during this same processs and from there on, the FireStick remote will be able to turn you TV on and off, raise, lower and mute Volume. Easy Peezy!If you are a NEW FireStick user it will be basically the same process, but you will also be prompted to set up an new Amazon Account in order to get going. Setting up a new Amazon Account is absolutely FREE! If you are a concerned parent you will also be able to easily setup Parental Controls during this initial process.Remember, you do NOT necessarily have to be a PRIME MEMBER to be able to get good use from a FireStick as there are all sorts of Free Apps you can download from the Amazon Store across many Interests and Genres. But being a Prime member opens up an whole other World with this as FireSticks are optimized for using Prime Video and Amazon Music Streaming services. But of course all the other big services (both free and subscription based) are there including YouTube, Netflix, ATV+, Disney+, etc., etc.In a simple summary, the 4K version of a Firestick is blazingly fast vs. My regular 1080p Stick. You can really notice the huge performance difference when surfing through the GUI menus and searching. As a FireStick user for several years now, I can certainly sense the difference between the two. There are times when there is a subtle lag or hickup if you will when clicking through the items in the Menus or searching. Don’t get me wrong, the basic 1080p Stick is a very good video streaming device, but the 4K variant just simply feels more “snappier” with much quicker user interface responses. A simple difference in specs makes all the difference. While the 1080p has basically the same CPU/GPU combination as the 4K stick,  the 4K actually has more memory... 1.5GB of RAM vs. 1GB in the 1080p version. While that may not sound like a lot, it certainly makes a big difference in the overall performance and a more pleasant and seemless overall viewing experience.All in all, I am very happy to have picked up the 4K FireStick “refresh”. I wanted a better 4K stick to replace my original 1080p version and at only a $10 or so difference between the two, I feel this decision is a no-brainer. The 4K variant also offers Dolby Vision/HDR over the 1080p Stick for those with a need for that in better home theatre or media room setups with displays that support that. I feel the 4K Stick really enhances our viewing experience over the basic 1080p Stick and I highly recommend the new both existing 1080p FireTV users as an upgrade and new users alike. (Please note that there is also a “Lite” version of the Firestick. This is basically the same as a 1080p Stick but has an “economy” remote which does not have the ability to control any TV functions. I personally would stay away from the “Lite” altogether unless unless your are OK with juggling multiple remotes for basic TV watching)Edit: And for those who are adventurous, despite what some say, you can in fact easily get more Storage on any FireStick with a simple splitter cable (avaialble on Amazon) that will allow you to power the stick as usual via USB as well has being able to insert a USB memory stick.. need 32GB? More?.. Just search YouTube to see how as are many videos on the subject. But, what do I need that for you ask? Well, the 4K Firestick makes an EXCELLENT video GAMING device! Again, lots of YouTube vids you can find with the answers. Have a Great Day!

It could be 5 stars if supporting more languages
Reviewed in Canada on January 1, 2022Verified Purchase
I have a Chomecast with Google TV and also tried Fire TV 4k  and Roku 4k Premiere. All of them come with Pros and Cons.1.  Chomecast with Google TV is my final choice based on my needs  Pros: Unbiased recommendation UI, acceptable voice control quality with abundant multiple languages support. It supports most of popular Asia languages.  Cons: The only device of three does NOT support Miracast. You can Chromecast to it but cannot use it as for wireless display out of box. You probably can ""mirror"" your PC screen with Chrome browser, however, you cannot ""extend"" to the TV/display as 2nd monitor. Other 2, after configuring casting/mirror/extend display, they can be found and connected by Windows 10 wireless display link.2. Fire TV 4k.  Pros: Pretty much everything other than ""multiple"" language text/voice support. It is the most quality built of three. I especially like its remote coming with all necessary buttons except TV input source selection button that's only seen in Chomecast with Google TV. However, that is not a big deal.  Cons: I believe it is good at most of western languages. Japanese is only supported Asia language. Please don't get wrong. The problem is only the ""number"" of language support. Its voice recognition quality in English is times better than Chomecast with Google TV. Beside, it seems able to take more commands too. For example, it can command Youtube to pause progress but Chomecast with Google TV cannot.3.  Roku 4k Premiere  I guess it not fair to compare this $29 entry level model with above mid level models. Anyway, the following is what I thought  Pros: For some reason, its picture looks obviously much more vivid than others when I enabled HDR on all of them and played same 4k landscape Youtube video on my Samsung UHD TV.  Cons: No recommendation engine. This means it cannot trace your watch behaviors to post the most likely content you want to watch.  No Buletooth support. No volume and power buttons on the remote. I heard their mid level models have those buttons. If you are Okay to download and use their ""remote"" app to your phone, the later ones probably are not the problem.

The flavour was very good mixed with Banana and an Orange. I did find the 2kg size was cheaper by $6.00 but didn't want to buy that much, at first, in case I didn't like it. I am feeling more alert and have more energy as compared to not eating in the morning.

The price I paid ($80) to get this protein powder, because its my absolutely favourite, was outrageous. Costco sells it for $45. BUT it is that good that I paid to get it. Blends perfectly into smoothies, nice vanilla taste, doesn't take overly fake or processed. Also blends very smoothly into oatmeal for protein oats. Highly recommend.

Good Quality Protein with Stevia, Only 2g Sugar
Reviewed in Canada on September 13, 2023Verified Purchase
Sept. 2023. This is a good product with stevia instead of sucralose or other artificial sweeteners, as well as both whey protein isolate and concentrate. It could stand to be a bit less sweet. There are no unnecessary additives and ""junk"" ingredients. I find this protein very effective when I train with heavy weights. The price has gone up a lot. It now comes in a bag instead of the plastic container, which is okay except that the ziplock is defective and the two sides will not fit together to close. I'm using three metal clips to keep the bag closed, but it is not airtight. I do recommend this protein for people who can consume whey (and I hope the ziplock closure defect gets fixed).Update Oct. 2023: After I received my LeanFit, which at the time of purchase had shown the photo of the tub, I noticed more differences compared to the bag version (see photo). Fewer BCAAs and protein, more sugar. Also, soy is listed on the bag ingredients (possibly for allergen purposes), which the tub does not have. Several years ago, there was an organic version of the tub. That disappeared, but now the next change is that the bags have slightly different ingredients, with more sugar and less protein. It's still a good product, but this trend is disappointing. Also, many Amazon product photos are updated to include a disclaimer that the actual product received may not be exactly like the photo. If the actual product shipped does not include the same ingredients or amounts, how do we know what we're buying if it is not accurately shown in the photo or stated in the text? Fortunately, the photo of the bag now does appear for a different listing, so it's accurate.

A lot prettier in person
Reviewed in Canada on June 7, 2023Verified Purchase
I had my doubts about this doll but she’s so much prettier in person. The pink on her dress is a lot pinker; almost like a hot pink. There was a lot of scandal about her face being ugly or not looking like Margot Robbie, but I think Mattel was aiming for a cross between the iconic 2000’s Barbie face and Margot Robbie’s likeness. Really cute. The bangs on mine aren’t horrible, I think the reason they chose bangs for this doll was to imitate the bangs that were prominent in a lot of the 2000’s dolls (I attached a reference pic). I don’t plan on taking her out of the box because it’s more of a display/collectible item for me, so I can’t give a comment on the quality or how it feels to hold her. She’s a lot bigger than I thought she would be but I think it’s a good thing. Love it!

I originally bought this cable to use as for running POE security cameras. It's nice and thin to go through windows without drilling. The cable is a tangle magnet, be careful as you unwind it or you will have a mess, I did and wasted an hour fixing it. The flat cable is VERY difficult to work with, stripping and putting another RJ45 connector on. So make sure you buy ONLY the length you need and don't plan on cutting it to size. The white color as you can imagine is a dirt magnet so when running it through ceilings and the like it's ugly fast. The cable itself is very pliable, but I don't think it would withstand much abuse so some care in running it and using cable ties is in order IMHO.

Honestly… should have bought this cord so much earlier. I recently bought a gaming pc which had built in wifi. I didn’t think I needed an Ethernet cord because 1. I wasn’t a heavy gamer, mainly just Sims 2. The router was in a different room entirely. The good thing was my pc can pick up the wifi fine but then I noticed when I got back onto a virtual world that my connection would be lost and my computer would actually freeze.I thought it was my internet being fidgety but it kept happening and when I googled the reason. The main thing was internet connection. So I finally cave in and started looking for a cord. Wasn’t sure how much I needed so I thought having more is better than having less. Over all it’s an amazing cord. Strong internet connection and now I don’t have to worry about my pc disconnecting because it is now hardwired to my router. Plus the price is soooo good!

It works it works it works
Reviewed in Canada on January 19, 2024Verified Purchase
Bottom line:there are many situations and conditions that cause snoring: mine is posture and airway passage (Genetics).  This works very well, I would snore 5 out of the 8h a night and kept my partner up the whole night.  Now it’s about 30-45mins of snoring spread through the night, basically quiet. Only negative if any is having sore teeth in the morning but after using it a week , you get used to it.My story:I have tried almost every trick to reduce snoringfrom significantly losing weight and changing my diet  to buying all kinds of accessories and none of them really worked in my particular case.I dreaded any medical intervention for my snoring as I knew it wasn’t sleep apnea; I sleep 8h nights , never wake up and normally feel well rested.I eventually went to a sleep clinic after 5 years and it was determined that my airway were slightly deformed just enough for me to snore.Turns out I need surgery.I’m an athletic man , I recorded myself at various weight points , worked out more , worked out less , changed my diet a bunch, all kinds of sleeping positions, all in all , nothing changed , only slightly better or worst but bad overall.Wasted tons of money on accessories but i preferred spending it all rather than regretting a surgery and having irreversible consequences.Worth every dollar, I will buy a few more.

My husband's snoring got so loud that it was preventing me from falling asleep at night. I started searching amazon for a solution. A co-worker told me she bought this item for her husband and it worked amazing so I immediately ordered one. The difference is like night and day. Some nights he was so quiet that I had to nudge him to make sure he was OK. This item worked wonders for my husband's snoring. It's directions are very simple, drop in boiling water and after bite down on it like you would a hockey mouth guard, which customizes it to your mouth. Would definately, 100%, recommend!

I've been using the Snore Guard for probably close to fifteen years and it has been a life changer. I'm sixty-five years old now but I had become a loud snorer from around my mid thirties.  I used to snore so loud that my wife would go sleep in the guest bedroom and our neighbours would often tell her that they could hear me snoring when they were sitting in their back yard. Very embarrassing! As well, even though I had never been diagnosed with sleep apnea, I used to wake up a few times a night trying to catch my breath or just from the sound of my own snoring. I also have had sinus problems since I was a teenager which got worse as I got older and that probably contributed to my super loud snoring.The Snore Guard worked for me immediately. The first few nights I used it my wife woke me up a couple of times every night because I wasn't snoring and she wanted to make sure I hadn't passed away in my sleep. When I say this cured my snoring, it really cured my snoring to the point where it didn't just reduce my snoring, it completely eliminated it. I noticed right away that I wasn't waking up in my sleep gasping for air and I definitely woke up feeling like I had just had a great night's sleep. It was also a really great feeling putting my head on the pillow and being able to breathe freely. The only drawback was that I did notice that my jaw was a bit sore at first but it wasn't painful, it was just a sensation that went away for me after three or four nights. It becomes so comfortable that I usually don't even realize it's in my mouth. And it's not so cumbersome that I can't kiss my wife before going to sleep.The recommendation is that this device be replaced every three to six months, but I've always used the same one for @ two years or more. When not in use I keep it in a cup of Listerine mouth wash that I replace every week and I brush it just like my teeth every night. That keeps it fresh and clean and I have never had a problem with sores in my mouth or anything like that. I have bought one of these for numerous relatives and there isn't one who didn't thank me for turning them on to this device.If it sounds like I love the Snore Guard, it has literally changed my life for the better. I just can't recommend it highly enough!

I’ve been applying lashes for 12 years, and have tried many glues. This glue is the one I reach for the most. After application it’s fairly quick drying and lasts a very long time. I’ve fallen asleep in my lashes, with no issues with adhesion. However, the brush applicator allows you to touch up the ends if you find the last is peeling up.

Very good for those on a steep budget, not great adjustability
Reviewed in Canada on March 14, 2024Size: 13"" - 30""Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Range of motion (3*) compared to some other higher price ranged options, this monitor stand/arms are very lacking. The height adjust-ability is extremely limited, which is what I believe to be the biggest drawback personally. Monitor tilt and angling is acceptable, however if your monitors are a bit on the wider end you may find some issues getting your monitors spaced and set with the best visibility. Still, for one of the cheaper monitor arms on amazon, you can't really go wrong and you're getting what you paid for.Assembly (5*) assembly was very straight forward, the instruction manual and illustrations are clear and easy to comprehend. There is extra hardware depending on if you'd like to mount the arm THROUGH your desk, or have it clipped/clamped onto the back edge; which is nice to have some options and variety for your setup. Hardware screws into the pre-threaded holes nicely, and it is also decent quality. Pretty good experience overall!Sturdiness (4*) being pretty basic with minimal adjust-ability compared to other options in the market, the sturdiness is pretty average I'd say. There are provided allen keys to loosen/tighten any joints you may want more rigidity out of; so you can tweak and fine tune your needs depending on your setup. Overall not bad, but also could be improved. Pretty much expected though for the reasonably inexpensive price tag.Overall not bad!

Works and performs just as described, just buy it
Reviewed in Canada on June 7, 2022Size: 13"" - 30""Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I bought this with some trepidation after reading some of the negative reviews. Ignore the negative reviews (likely operator error on install). This arrived well packaged, all components safely packed in the master carton. Instructions are clear and easy to follow. Just take your time and you can do it without assistance. I installed two identical 24” monitors. Initial plan was to use the clamp to desk method and I started down that path until finding the clamp won’t fit on back of my desk due to the privacy panel is too close to the edge of the desk. Ok, so the other option is to drill a hole through your desk and mount it that way. Admitted I was not crazy about the idea of drilling a hole, however no issues (again just take your time, put painter’s tape on the desk before you drill down to protect the top, drill slowly). Instructions are clear on how to modify the clamp for this install. The only caution here is the instructions tell you to use a 3/8” drill bit for the hole. I found it was too snug so I had to go back with the drill the bit and gently just slightly widen the hole a little and ended up with a perfect fit. I would not just move to next largest drill bit, you will likely end up with too much play in the hole which will affect your satisfaction, you do want that to be a snug hole.After installing the monitors, you will need to use the provided Allan keys to possibly loosen and then tighten some or all of the joints in both monitor arms after you install and get the monitors at right height and viewing angle. My monitors fit perfectly together with virtually no gap between the two. Height might be out .5 mil but so close I did not worry about trying to adjust it and it is not even noticeable they are virtually same.I couldn’t be more happy with this purchase, worked perfectly for my home office setup. You should make note that depending on your situation and how you bend the two monitor arms, you may need to allow for a gap between your desk and the wall. That is simply a function of the angle of the monitor arms that you configure, it is not a flaw with the product.Don’t hesitate buying this product, it is as described and works flawlessly.

VIVO Dual Monitor Desk Mount
Reviewed in Canada on January 18, 2023Size: 13"" - 30""Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
The VIVO Dual Monitor Desk Mount offers the ability to offer a clean and modern desk setup. By utilizing VIVO Dual Monitor Desk Mount you not only clear up desk space (as you no longer have to use the large stands that come with the monitor) and you can simply screw your monitors onto the mount. The monitor mount allows for *nearly* complete customization of your monitor layout. You can adjust the height and angles of the monitor. The one dilemma is that VIVO Dual Monitor Desk Mount  fixates both monitors on the same ""level"" therefore if you have two different size monitors, they may not align (since the heigh can only be adjusted at one point, that operates jointly for both monitors). If you can over look this slight ""design"" inconvenience, the VIVO Dual Monitor Desk Mount is an excellent, sturdy option to mount two monitors on....Not the mention the setup is a breeze with detailed instructions on how to do so (wish the mount was slightly larger  though to allow the connection to thicker desks)

These new style controllers and great. I particularly like the coarse grips to prevent slipping. Triggers are good and the thumbsticks are responsive.****Product update***** Controller barely lasted a year. Left thumbstick wanders and is unresponsive sometimes. Not used for violent action games. Just used for mild entertainment. Never dropped. I've had xbox controllers last 2 to 4 years in the past. These are cheap junk now.

Easy set-up out of the box, works almost flawlessly.
Reviewed in Canada on March 18, 2022Verified Purchase
Bought this for the few games I play with a controller on my PC after my original wired XBOX One controller stopped working. This came with batteries and worked right away, all I had to do was enable bluetooth on my PC and follow the instructions.Pairing was a breeze, and I fired up a game. Partway through the controller inputs stopped working, it had lost bluetooth connection. Windows update had found a driver update, and after installing that, the connection was much more reliable.It still stops responding for about 10-30 seconds, maybe once every half hour, but that might be an issue with my set up rather than the controller, I haven't looked too deeply into it.

I use it on my laptop on Windows 11 mostly to play games on Steam, but also games on emulators and Xbox live on the laptop and Minecraft, stuff like that. The pairing is seamless and incredibly quick, it pairs in like milliseconds every time which is impressive. The feel of the controller in your hand is probably the best of any controller out there on the market. Feels so much better to play games with it rather than with the keyboard and mouse. The only thing that's weird is that it needs AA batteries but also needs to be charged.

Fantastic Product!
Reviewed in Canada on April 4, 2021Verified Purchase
I don't often write product reviews but felt compelled todo so on this one.  I read a lot of the reviews here prior to buying this and they are truly polarizing.  People either love it or hate it.  There are a lot of negative reviews which caused me to pause before deciding to buy it.  First and foremost, I bought the Meater Plus (50m range), from Amazon Canada, in March 2021.  Secondly, my intended use for this product is not something hard core like a smoker, a fire pit, or a pig roaster and I've never owned a product like this before so perhaps my bar isn't as high as other reviewers.  Until now, all I've ever used is a plain, cheap, and simple analog thermometer that displays ambient temp and internal temp.  My intended use cases for this product is for roasts in the oven and everyday BBQ outdoors, right outside my house.  I want to limit the number of trips back and forth to check the meat (taking time and disturbing the ambient temperature) and am hoping to improve the consistency of my cooks (perfect internal temperature).  Living in Canada where I BBQ in the winter, opening the lid to the BBQ to check the meat is detrimental to the heat and makes it very challenging to produce good outcomes consistently.I just had the opportunity to use the Meater Plus for the first time at Easter.  I roasted a turkey and a ham in the oven it it performed very well.  I had my analog thermometer in the meat along with the Meater and can validate that they were taking the same measurements (ambient and internal temperatures) within a couple degrees from one another.  In terms of the range, I didn't really push the limits on this one since it was indoor roasting but I can say that the App stayed connected the entire time (5+ hours) and I was all over my house with my SmartPhone.For the cooking time, I followed the App's directions closely and it produced excellent results with the two roasts being juicy and tender.  The App itself is awesome!  In addition to the estimated cook time, which takes a lot of the guess work out of planning the oven logistics for a large holiday meal, I also love the charting capability which taught me a thing or two about my convection oven and how it is inconsistent and inaccurate with it's heating.  I also really like the configurable alerts.  I used one such alert on the ham to remind me when to add my glaze before the end of the cook.  For BBQ, I intend to add additional alerts for ambient temperature rising and falling suddenly in the BBQ to alert me immediately to flare ups on the grill or running out of propane.Full disclosure, as I said above, I did not push the limits on the range nor did I try the range extending feature with multiple smart phones over WiFi.  I also have not yet tried this probe in an outdoor BBQ to test the connectivity through the exterior walls and the BBQ itself.  I will amend this review once I try it and report back.  I'm hoping the Bluetooth alone will be adequate and I won't need to leave another phone near the BBQ while I'm cooking.Lastly, on initial setup, I noted that many reviewers here reporting the probe not connecting at all despite being right beside the charging box.  I also encountered that issue when first opening the product, and was stumped for a little while, but ultimately realized that the charging box comes with a small piece of paper between the battery cathode and the connection in the box to ensure the battery stays new.  The downside of this is that the probe itself is not charged when you first open the product despite the fact that the box is fully functional using it's brand new battery.  So if you're having a hard time connecting it initially (flashing red light on the box), remove the paper from the battery compartment, place the probe back into the box and simply let the probe charge for a few hours.So far, I give this 5 stars.  Some will say that it's a too pricey but, for me, it's worth the price if it gives me more data and has the built in intelligence to estimate the cook time.  In the end, it hits all the requirements for me by allowing me to focus my time on other meal prep and/or socialize with guests while relying on the app to feed me real time alerts including telling me when the meat is ready to come off the heat.

Cook to perfection
Reviewed in Canada on January 17, 2024Verified Purchase
Used mine for the first time and steaks came out perfectly.  The app takes some time to setup and go through all the tutorials but worth it.  I love the fact that it provides so many options for different types of steaks (not just 1).  As I was BBQing outside in the middle of winter, I don't like to keep opening the lid to check the temp on the steaks and loose all the heat.  With the meater I didn't have to, gave me internal temp continually, provided a pretty accurate time remaining (which allowed me to time the rest of the meal) and told me exactly when to remove and even gave me the correct time to let them rest before I put them on the searing station.  Steaks were cooked perfectly!!!!!!While the price on these is a bit steep, you pay for quality and I'm definitely going to be getting at least one more probe!  Enjoy!

App is annoying, thermometer is great.
Reviewed in Canada on November 23, 2023Verified Purchase
The app forces you to watch 3 how-to videos before you can set up a ""cook"".  It took me at least 10 minutes just to figure out the reason I couldn't get to the part of the app where I set a target temperature was because I hadn't watched the videos all the way to the end. Really frustrating, but should be a one-time issue.I also had issues getting the app to connect to the base and the base to connect to the thermometer. It all seems overly complicated for a meat thermometer.The thermometer itself works beautifully. The roast reached the correct internal temperate 20 minutes before the timer would have gone off using a minutes-per-pound cooking method, and so I was rewarded with perfectly cooked, juicy beef.I'd give this five stars if the app isn't problematic moving forward.

Superb meat thermometer that will ensure you never waste an expensive cut of meat ever again
Reviewed in Canada on December 26, 2023Verified Purchase
It's not the most intuitive thing to use. Just so you know, the base needs to be pretty close to the probe at all times and the phone needs to be connected to the base. My Meater is very prone to losing connection. It's mostly just annoying as the app saves all progress even after losing connection, so a quick reset fixes it.But the recipes and the system it gives you to cook virtually any meat, be it turkey or chicken or any cut of steak / roast, is almost perfect. I've made multiple ribeye steaks, striploin, and yesterday did a full 4kg prime rib over 6 hours of cook time. I've never once before made perfect medium rare prime rib that's fully cooked throughout. Sure, I'm not professional chef, but it's nice not wasting $100 worth of meat and having a meal that everybody is raving about.The recipes provided by Meater in the app are great with awesome videos and step by step instructions, as well as reasoning for each step. But you don't have to use it if you know the temps you need to reach and the proper techniques to cooking meat. I've used it to learn how to roast meat low and slow and the results are just divine every time.The temps are completely accurate. The done-ness every time I've used it has always been perfect too, right down to the resting time. There's even graphs inside the app so you can track the oven air temperature (which fluctuates quite a lot surprisingly), and internal meat temperature. Estimated cooking times are the best too.It's given me some really good insights on how much to adjust cook time for when you're opening the oven every 30 minutes to baste the meat. No more guessing, so it's always consistently perfect. No need to rely on any archaic methods like pushing in the meat or stabbing with a knife then using your gut feeling.I really think if you spend a lot of time cooking expensive meats or roasting birds / meats for half a day, you need to get one of these.The only downsides are this doesn't work on thin cuts of meat (the instructions say not to use this if the probe cannot be completely inside the meat) and the app has a lot of disconnects. But other than that it's a very solid recommendation!

The idea behind this is awesome, the execution isn't perfect though. As stated by others, it is quite flimsy, even a sheet can make it sway a lot. Another issue is that the green connecting pieces don't sit tightly into the orange balls that hold everything together. The glow isn't super bright and so it's not very noticeable. We will keep it but in my opinion, the price isn't worth the product you get. It's especially flimsy if you have clumsy toddlers that don't understand that you have to be SUPER careful not to make it fall apart

Not Sturdy and Had Defects Preventing Assembly with some of the Pieces
Reviewed in Canada on October 2, 2023Edition: 80pcs fortsVerified Purchase
Fun idea but poorly executed. The pieces are lightweight and unable to hold much weight, so you can only really use a light sheet on the fort - heavier blankets will cause it to collapse easily.Also, the pieces do not fit together cleanly. They had significant plastic excess during manufacturing that blocks the sticks from inserting into the joints. This rendered several of the pieces useless until I took a small blade and carved out the excess plastic inside.The green stick pieces are prone to bending and weakening since they're hollow and flimsy.Overall, I definitely would not buy this. There must be a higher quality version out there from a more reputable brand.

This has a solution for everything I hated about other go cups. A metal seam at the bottom where nastiness gathers? No. A lid with a hard to clean sliding opening? nope.  Does it only keep drinks warm for a short time? No, keeps them boiling hot for hours. Does it have an irritating handle? No. Does it leak like every other go cup? No. I cant find even a single problem with this gocup.

Amazing for heat retention, Leaks quite a lot
Reviewed in Canada on October 12, 2020Colour Name: BlackSize: 1 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
This thing hold temperature like no other. I can pour boiling water in it, cap it, leave it 5 hours and it will still be scalding hot. I'm incredibly impressed by how well it handles heat, if this is your most important feature then you'd be hard pressed to find something that does better. Cleaning is also super easy as the spout is just a magnetic piece that separates fairly easily, essentially eliminating any spots where stuff can build up. LEAKAGE though is brutal. Since the spout is only magnetic, it has the tendency  spew contents onto the top of the lid if you shake it a little (like when you commute). There is a drain to let it back into the cup and the lip is high enough to prevent spillage but if it topples over you will absolutely have to wipe up after it. The 20oz tumblr is also dummy thick and as such cannot fit in smaller cupholders. Overall I love it but it does have its downsides.

But 2 couple of bumpers purchased locally at the hardware store and installed on the underside of the seat solved the problem. Would be nice of they were included as it did require an extra trip to the hardware store and maybe a heads up before ordering since they are NOT Included.Otherwise the BIDET works great and cleans the human parts it needs to clean. OH and BTW our toilet paper consumption is down two thirds. Cost recovery 2-3 months and this item pays for itself

Reviewed in Canada on June 6, 2021Style: Boric Life 30 CountVerified Purchase
For a chronic case it has improved but not completely irradicated bv yet but seems Im almost there to the point to leave a review. I really suggest the site aunt vadge I found from another reviewer. I had an issue for over 10 years that seems to be almost gone but WILL update.I would consider repurchase or go with another brand has some irritation or sand in your vagina feeling lol....versus pictures of other brands soft powder. I recommend you buy some ph balance gel to use with it like good clean love brand. As some cases can reoccur just to have some on hand. The gel has aloe which is soothing, cuts down on bacteria and balances the ph which boric doesnt do with lactic acid in it. And get ph balanced more natural lube that has lactic acid.I followed alot of other supportive advice then used the supp with gel for a little over a week. Had a period and then am now at almost a week follow up after my period its almost gone for good. You also must do this after your next couple period maybe a day or so for maintenace after you clear your issue because of ph. Til you feel safe its gone for good.I bought ph strips and made sure to test myself before I started the process. Yep ph was way too high. BV.i also ran out of options with my Dr everything I tested negative, not yeast one time, all bv doesnt test for just one bacteria as well. And so the antibiotics never worked for me either, and after trying yeast treatments.There is some mucous still but they recommend you do 2 weeks of treatment it has improved at least 90% of symptoms. And I have maybe 4 or so days left.Must do excellent hygiene like no tampons, wipes in the bathroom I put drops of tea tree inside the packet and squeezed them. Cotton underwear, let it breathe at night. No baths only shower.So I recommend these boric treatments I tried alot of other things like vit c apple cider vinegar h202 probiotcs and not alot worked elsewise. I know the vjay is supposed to be self cleaning and all I dont buy those summers eve but I was desperate to find something to work and my self esteem damadge. I suspect gut health and other health issues and genetics predisposes me to bacterial infection. I take immune boosting supplements too. I suspect the people who say boric acid didnt work either had another issue or didnt do the other supportive things to especially clear a nasty chronic case with biofilm. Biofilm is a coating which makes it hard to kill and remove the bacteria like a plaque of slime.I am not one for douching but look into n acetyl cysteine caps as an oral rinse and douche will break down the bacterial wall, then a gentle douche with diluted peroxide to kill and remove any discharge...then start the ph gel with boric inserts daily immediately. The gel can be used on its own between also for a few days after alone.If your partner has bad mouth hygeine too get them to do the oral rinse to break down the bacteria.

First of all, don't wait, just buy it.It says to use for 6 days straight but by the end of day 3 everything was back to normal ( but I added a 4th day,  just for good measure)The reviews did not disappoint. These capsules work amazing. You get  a lot for your money, compared to just a 1 time treatment of 3 days that is avaliable from the pharmacy.Also, I would like to note, that my nether regions which  was always dry as a desert 🏜,  is now always lubricated. Which I can only assume is from proper PH levels.My advice to you , JUST BUY THEM!!!

It is a good but dangerous product
Reviewed in Canada on July 11, 2022Style: Boric Life 30 CountVerified Purchase
At first, it is good. It gave the vagina a cool feeling. The capsule is easy to be inserted into vagina too. But as I wished my vagina feels less itchy quickly so I inserted 1 around 12 hours. On the third day, I don't know if it was because I inserted it too deep to reach the Pelvic so that too much toxic Boric acid was absorbed by the body or other reasons. I waked up at 5am because of rising heart. It is so scary that feels like a near death experience. I am afraid my heart gonna stop at any time because it is rising so fast. I saw my pupil is getting wider and wider when looking at myself in the mirror. There is a direct white light at the top of the mirror. I felt so scary. Have no appetite too. I don't have a lot of medical knowledge but heard that when pupil gets wider that is a sign of almost death. So I rushed to call 911 later felt maybe not that severe so I rushed to emergency.  Even if it is not severe to die, I feel it is extremely uncomfortable. This product is good but should be used in a smaller amount than it instructed.

Reviewed in Canada on September 3, 2023Verified Purchase
So you’ve read an article that Elon Musk stuck it to the man by producing a device that will reduce your power bill by 90%.  What did I do, I immediately went to Amazon - in my naivety and curiosity figured if Amazon carries the product it must be okay.  NOT!  My first red flag was the CHEENGLISH (no offence to anyone) and it occurred to me that absolutely no one at Tesla, let along Elon Musk would all the communication in such terrible English - so I know it can’t be.  I then went online and started to do some digging.  Let me save you time.  This is an outright scam, sophisticated pump and dump.  I have not tried the devise because who the hell knows what it will do to my system - funny if its just a flashing green light, but what is its a more nefarious technology that can link into my wifi and computer system, or worse?  I am what you would call a sophisticated person so I feel like an idiot for buying it.  BUT hey goes to show we can all get scammed.  So I am writing this as favour to my fellow persons out there.  You’ve been warned.

Perfect Addtion to a small TV.
Reviewed in Canada on July 26, 2016Style: TV Sound SystemVerified Purchase
I have a small (32"") Samsung flat screen tv that, needless to say has very poor sound.  I bought that size TV to fit in a wooden cabinet that was made for an old model, non flat screen tv.  I needed a sound bar to improve the sound that also fit in this cabinet.  The Bose Solo 5 fit the bill perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  It is really hard to find something in this size range, but best of all, the sound is better than I expected for such a small unit.  I should mention that I am hearing impaired and wear hearing aids in both ears. I often have trouble understanding dialogue from TV speakers and even some Sound Surround 5.1 systems give me trouble.  The Bose Solo 5, however, provides very clear voice recognition, even without using their dedicated voice mode. If you have a small TV and want to improve the sound using a small sound bar,  I highly recommend the Bose Solo 5.

Easy to use remote control, compact design with clear sound and adjustable bass level.Sound level is very good, even for a large living room. Clear voice.Compact model, only 22"" large, makes it easily portable.Inputs:- 1 mini-3.5 mm stereo analog input- 1 S/PDIF RCA-Coaxial digital input- 1 S/PDIF Toslink digital input (optical cable included)No HDMI inputsBose Solo 5 TV playbacks PCM (Stereo) and Dolby Digital (AC3) formats through both S/PDIF inputs.Unfortunately it does not decode the DTS digital format.If this sound bar is connected to the S/PDIF output of a HDTV or to a DVD-Blu-ray player capable of reconverting to Dolby Digital or PCM formats, there should be no problem. Otherwise, no sound will playback from a DTS soundtrack.A product of this price and quality would have been perfect if DTS digital format would have been supported.Also, there is no visual indication of the sound level.But overall, I'm very satisfied with this product.

Good sound, ""universal"" remote doesn't pair with anything
Reviewed in Canada on December 6, 2020Style: TV Sound SystemVerified Purchase
The sound quality is impressive for the price. Decent bass, good mids, great clarity.One complaint is you cannot pair your tv to the sound bar. Which wouldn't be a problem if the universal remote worked or paired well, spoiler, it doesn't. Doesn't pair with my Shaw cable box, my one year old 65"" Hitachi smart tv or my Fire tv cube.No power button on the unit itself, so completely reliant on the remote. If your fine with adding another remote to your coffee table permanently I would say it's worth it for the sound and price.

Amazing little guy! This is all you really need for sound. This has greatly improved sound from just the regular tv speakers. Our living room is a decent size and this speaker roars through the house ( when the volume is really loud ). Movie nights, gaming, streaming music, it does it all and with crisp sound! Finished paying this off with amazons payment plans. Had it for a few months. I love this sound bar. It’s perfect for small - medium maybe even large living rooms. You don’t need a subwoofer, if your in an apartment or condo it gets really loud and the bass is great. You’ll piss off your neighbors. Subwoofer would be great for a small theatre. It’s Bose you can’t go wrong.

It gets 4 stars because its battery doesn't last 8 hours like it says & the cord isn't long enough to leave it stationary & plugged in all the time. I had to buy an extension usb cord for it. I don't mind if I have to keep it plugged in as it's a bedside lamp, but I had to plug it in to charge every other night when I first got it. I definitely don't have it on for four hours a night, so if you're looking for longevity keep it plugged in. Also, the buttons on the remote don't always respond on the first try but they haven't stopped responding altogether, so that's fine. It'd be much better with a longer black cord so it's not as visible & more easily kept plugged in if necessary.I do love it on my Bastet stand though. I keep it on the orange setting & it's a perfect glow with the colours of my walls.Note: even on the white setting at the brightest illumination it's not very bright. If you want a bright lamp this may not be for you. I find it a very soothing & relaxing glow. The photo shown is at its brightest on the orange setting.

Reviewed in Canada on April 10, 2024Size: 5.9 InchColour Name: 16 ColorsVerified Purchase
It's cute but keep your expectations low.PROS- Colours are nice and vivid.- Genuine white LED inside so it looks like the real moon.- Flash/strobe/fade options.- Comes with a cool looking wood stand (5.7"" model).- There is a touch sensor at the bottom of it in case the remote doesn't work.- The moon's design is pretty decent. It actually looks like the moon. You can see the lines from the 3D printing but you have to look closely.CONS- Mine came with a dead remote battery. Lol.- Remote's range is short - maybe 1 metre at best.- No option to change the speed of the effect options.- It is dim. Wouldn't use it as a reading light/desk light. For comparison, it's not brighter than my computer's monitor. If my room light is on, and the colour is set to white, it doesn't even look like it's on.- The charging cable is only a 2 foot USB cord, and there is no wall adapter.If you're going to buy this, buy an extra CR2025 battery and a USB to wall adapter.

I have the 3"" version which fits perfectly anywhere.  I like that there's a bright white light, plus a golden colour option. Hand stand is cute and stable. This would make a perfect gift for just about anyone.  I'd probably get the next size version for a gift. Great item for the money !

Great customer service (YourCanadianGameStore)
Reviewed in Canada on April 20, 2021Verified Purchase
The wii console I received is in good working order. Definitely some cosmetic issues but nothing crazy, it was expected as I know it’s not brand new. I ordered from YourCanadianGameStore and had great customer service. Arrived within about 4 or 5 days with the sensor bar, all required cords, nunchuk and remote. The remote ended up not working so I contacted the seller and received fantastic customer service. I was contacted >10 minutes and given the option of a refund for the remote or a new one shipped out to me the next day. Great service from YourCanadianGameStore!

Reviewed in Canada on December 13, 2022Verified Purchase
This item is sold via third party seller. It took longer than usual Prime to ship in my experience.The item arrived; working with signs of use. Photos included. A few light material scratches also some stains here and there, but nothing that I wasn’t able to get out on my own.It did not come with the sensor (which I originally did not realize that I needed for the controllers to work). I ordered a new one on Amazon and it arrived the next day.It came with quite a few attachments. A rechargeable battery pack and dock for one of the controllers, two nunchucks, one gun, and two controllers.But, no sensor. If my stepchildren had opened this gift on Christmas day, without it being in working order, this would’ve been one of the most disappointing experiences of my modern life.Luckily, with the addition of the sensor, it works!

Reviewed in Canada on February 21, 2024Size: Queen VerticalVerified Purchase
This project took me 4 full days to put it together.  It is not a minor project and it requires tools and skills.  This is not a beginner project.  The hardware kit, which is just over $300, is only a small part of your expenditure.  I bought 4x8 sheets of finished maple plywood and all the pieces the instructions told me I needed at Home Depot and spent another $900.  I had the plywood cut at Home Depot as the cut sheets are included in the instructions.  Getting it cut on their panel saw was easier than doing it on my table saw, it took about a half-hour and cost me $20.  The instructions provided with the hardware are great, and there are videos to follow on the Internet at YouTube.  Read the instructions and watch all of the videos before you even start, it will save you troubles.  The bed is great and gives us a lot of extra space in our spare bedroom.  It's very sturdy and easy to open and lift up when finished.  The bed pictured is the vertical Queen sized bed.

I can see no reason for criticism: the instructions are excellent. I cant see anyway to make them better. Three booklets with online video instructions, perfect! There is a fair bit of work involved with all the cutting that is required, but once that is complete, it goes together very smoothly. At least that was my experience and, again, I would argue its due to the great instructions. Happy I bought it.

Bought this product as I wanted to make more space to use our spare room as an office and not just a bedroom.  After doing some research I decided to give this a try.  The instructions right from the cutting of the material to putting it together are amazingly good.  The bed is very sturdy when put together and I am very happy with the way it turned out.I would suggest that you need to be somewhat into wood working, as you will need to have some skill/experience to pull off some nice finishing.  Also, if you don't have really good table saw/or a couple of extra hands, I would suggest on getting the hardware stores to cut the plywood sheets for you.Altogether, it isn't a cheaper project, with hardware/materials/tools required to finish the job was between $1050 to $1100, but worth it when you can add whatever finish you like.100% would buy this product again.

Get this while it's at its original price point!
Reviewed in Canada on March 18, 2023Verified Purchase
Well, there's really not much I can say about this console is that it's definitely worth the buy! If you'replanning on buying a PS5 get it while it's at its original price point. This console sells out inevitably fast.If you plan on using this console on a 1440p monitor; it works very well and looks great even with the 120hz. I have yet to try 4k but I'm sure that works great without any problems. The only problem I have with plugging it into my monitor is that I can't get audio out of the monitor through the HDMI cord for some reason, so I have to resort to plugging a 3.5 audio connection into the controller which is no problem.The setup process is dead simple which was nice since I haven't owned a PlayStation console since 2012. And especially since this console sells so quickly once you get your hands on one it's nice to show off lol.Otherwise, if you're looking for a great plug and play console even for the PlayStation exclusives is what made me buy one go for it. We don't know how long it's going to take for them to port all their games over to PC, might take years for them to come over.

One of the longest (and most expencive) orders iv ever clicked to ship. But showed up via Canada Post one day earlier than it was supposed too. The Amazon box fit the PS5 box's height and length perfectly but was a little deep. Was surprised no foam or bubbles in that space. But the PS5 was in a sealed retail box and was no worse for wear. Game coupon included.  Would of liked some bubbles on a 700$ order but can't complain.

Bought this for a lady friend who enjoys new toys, and gave the following points:- excellent vibration (so good she apparently peed a bit)- use with lube, otherwise the vibration alone on tender parts could be painful- holds a good charge- easy to charge- looks cute on the nightstand- shape and size not great for travel, should stay in the one bedroom- great pricing!10/10 would recommend

I didn’t know what to expect when I bought this. I saw it all over TikTok & as a gen z I let the internet tell me what to do, so I got this lol. It arrived today; I tried it once, and I’m in trouble because I’m 100% addicted! I truly wasn’t ready. This thing has a lot of power. It takes about 2 hours to charge to full battery and lasts only around 50 minutes at full power which I don’t like, but you DON’T need 50 minutes with this thing lmao. The suction isn’t really suction, but it really doesn’t matter. She’s powerful lol. 10/10

Use LOTS of charcoal
Reviewed in Canada on February 28, 2023Verified Purchase
I find I have to use LOTS of charcoal to get this as hot as I like it, and be ready to add more on longer cooks.  But that's my personal taste.  Two screws to put together is easy, unit feels heavy and solid, no danger of breaking.  Cleaning with your favourite scraper (or an aluminum ball!) and maintaining seasoning is easy.  Cleaning is easy once it has cooled down.  Happy to have this little grill on car-camping trips or burgers in the park or at the beach.

The one drawback is the use of full size stickers on both sides of the case that cannot be removed without damaging the case surface. They serve no purpose but ruin the looks of the case.

Remove the adhesive, and stick it on top of the box! Now instead of the usual pull, and tear up along a blade under the box lid we all hate doing because the plastic wrap starts hugging itself, you pull and slide a blade across the plastic for a clean effortless cut and less of the wrap hugging itself.

Colourful sugar juice in small plastic tubes.  Probably as bad for my health as it is for the environment, but sometimes you just got to splurge.I like how small these are and the low calorie count.  It makes portion control easy.  A nice strong flavour makes it easy to just eat one or two and be satisfied.  Although, I don't like the cherry flavour. I almost wish I could buy the flavours individually so I don't have to get cherry.  Reminds me of medicine.They take a while to freeze in the box, so if you are in a hurry, take them out of the box for quicker freezing.The only thing I don't like is the sharp edges to the plastic, but you get that with any snack like this.Keep an eye on the price as most of the time it's cheaper here, but in the spring and early summer, the grocery stores have this on sale for way less.

Best toy ever
Reviewed in Canada on December 25, 2016Colour Name: BlueVerified Purchase
We just put the kiddos- ages 2 years and 9 months - to bed this Christmas night and my husband has since, been playing with the plasma cars.  While he found them enjoyable, he did have a couple of recommendations.1) Please add a cushion. He is starting to feel his age and his keister is tender.  Perhaps, it's the padded chairs at work - if he chose to sit in a plain plastic chair it would be easier but, for all your 25+ year old plasma car enthusiasts, a cushion option would be lovely.2) They're too short. Now, they're a great height for the children who we bought them for - a perfect height, I'd say.  My husband, however, is 5'7 and apparently, finds them too short. He has a cramp (so do I but it's in the form of a headache caused by trying not to laugh at him). He'd like an extra-tall option for the same enthusiasts who would like a cushion.3) He would also like a motor - a little one, though (I'm so sorry, PlaSmart).  Apparently, it is very difficult to get over the bumps in the floor and a motor would help him glide with ease.  Personally, I think he could use the cardio workout but as he lay on the floor, holding his rump, cramped up from the short car and breathing heavily from the workout - perhaps, he should just accept that he should let the kids play with their own toys and he can go play with his PS4 instead!Yes, there's my review - this thing is more fun than a PS4 and my husband is willing to cause himself bodily pain to glide across the floor yelling ""wheeee"", possibly waking up the true owners of these toys - the children. 100% worth every penny for such a great product!

Reviewed in Canada on January 5, 2016Colour Name: PurpleVerified Purchase
Very well designed, excellent hardware and very tough plastic.  It was simple to assemble and only needed a rubber mallet and although it came with a make-shift socket to tighten the bolt for the steering mechanism, my husband preferred to use his own socket wrench.  I was expecting the wheels to be cheap/thin plastic, but they are also very tough and quite thick.  These will not wear out anytime in the next several years.  I did order a set of urethane wheels for this to be used indoors, but the wheels it came with will be excellent for outdoor play.My husband has already tested it out himself, and found it fun and easy to use (he's well over 200 pounds).  This will be a big hit with our granddaughter and grand-nephew when they visit.  :)

Great car - will get years of play
Reviewed in Canada on July 28, 2016Colour Name: RedVerified Purchase
Wonderful, sturdy car for my 1.5 yr old toddler. Can't beat the design & quality. We don't use ours inside on hardwood floors -- only outside on sidewalks, driveways, basketball courts, etc.  She loves how fast it can go, and it gets her tons of exercise. She has tipped over on it, but only a few times, and it's not the car's fault - she loves to go (super) fast, and is learning how gravity works when you cut a turn too fast! When it does tip on her, it's lightweight enough that I don't have to worry about it hurting her, so it's the perfect way to learn, in my opinion. She adores this car, and I am confident she will continue to love it as she grows - a great investment considering how easily kids tire of pricey toys.Putting it together on my own was fine, up until lining up the steering wheel to ensure it was on perfectly straight -- much easier if you have someone else there to help hold it steady.

The gift that stole Christmas!
Reviewed in Canada on December 30, 2017Colour Name: BlueVerified Purchase
This toy is awesome! Once my 4 year-old son saw the PlasmaCar under the tree this Christmas, he could scarcely be bothered with the rest of his gifts.  And who could blame him?  The PlasmaCar is phenomenal!  It is super sturdy and well-built out of colourful, high-quality material.  Once you get on, it only takes seconds to get the ""hang"" of it and get on the move.  I can't tell you how many times he made the circuit around the house... and days later, he's still going!  It doesn't work well on carpet, but lucky for us, we have a good amount of tile upstairs and an unfinished basement, so he can have hours of fun. I am not a big person, so I decided to give it a try.  Wow - what fun!  It provides a bit of a workout, too.  I may have to order a second so we can have PlasmaCar races downstairs.  Suffice it to say, we are thrilled with this purchase!

Reviewed in Canada on September 2, 2023Colour Name: RedVerified Purchase
I am so disappointed that this item is not eligible for returns. The quality of this compared to another brand sold on Amazon is cheap and does not work as it should. The wheels scratch my floor and do not grip at all, which causes the steering wheel to skip and slide and my son ends up falling over. I’ve had the other brand for over two years and it still works amazing. I now have to lose more money and just buy the brand I should have to begin with as my other son feels left out. Neither want to use this one.

Both of my kids (ages 7 and 10) enjoyed playing this game. We also had fun playing it as a family. There are lots of characters to pick from and the tracks are neat. I don't like that you need to buy an expansion pack separately to access more characters and additional tracks though.

The classic white border gives a nostalgic and timeless look to the images. This bulk pack is great value for money, especially for those who love capturing moments frequently. The film is compatible with all Instax Mini cameras and ensures consistent performance. It's perfect for events, scrapbooking, or just capturing everyday moments. Highly recommend for Instax camera users!

Instax instant photos are a fun addition to weddings, parties or any other events. Not the best quality photo but that is part of the experience. Used for my Photo Booth and for my Guest Book at my wedding - great way to remember my event! The 100 pack is the best value. I picked up some used Instax Mini cameras for cheap - no noticeable difference in picture quality between newer or older version cameras.Film came in extremely fast and in good condition with lots of time left on the film expiration. This film does expire so make sure you use it beforehand! Expired film may not develop. Store film in a dark, temperature controlled environment to also preserve quality! Will buy for my next event!

Capturing Memories: My Experience with Fujifilm Instax Mini Film Multi-Pack
Reviewed in Canada on February 19, 2024Size: 60 ExposuresColour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
As a multi-faceted creator in the realms of jewelry design, 3D modeling, and crafting, I often find myself documenting my creative process and sharing snippets of my life with my audience through vlogs and streams. Recently, I decided to give the Fujifilm Instax Mini Film Multi-Pack a try to add a touch of instant nostalgia to my content. While the experience has been overall positive, there are a few aspects worth considering.On the positive side, the convenience of having 60 exposures in one pack is undeniably practical. Whether I'm capturing candid moments in the studio, behind-the-scenes footage at crafting events, or simply documenting my daily life, having an ample supply of film on hand ensures that I never miss a moment. Plus, the compact size of the Instax Mini film makes it easy to carry around, allowing me to snap photos on the go without lugging around bulky equipment.Moreover, the instant gratification of seeing physical prints develop right before my eyes adds a charming element to my content creation process. There's something special about holding a tangible photo in my hands, instantly evoking memories and emotions that can't quite be replicated with digital images. The vintage aesthetic of the Instax Mini prints also adds a nostalgic flair to my vlogs and streams, enhancing the visual appeal of my content.However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. Firstly, the cost per exposure can add up, especially when compared to digital photography. While the convenience and novelty of instant film are undeniable, it's worth weighing the cost against the value of physical prints, particularly for creators on a budget.Additionally, the image quality of Instax Mini prints may not meet the standards of professional photography. While the retro aesthetic is part of the charm, the colors can sometimes appear washed out or overly saturated, particularly in low-light conditions. This is something to keep in mind for creators who prioritize image quality in their content.In conclusion, the Fujifilm Instax Mini Film Multi-Pack offers a fun and convenient way to add a touch of nostalgia to my content creation process. While the cost and image quality may not be ideal for professional use, the instant gratification and charming aesthetic make it a worthwhile addition to my toolkit. For creators looking to infuse their content with a dose of vintage flair and spontaneity, the Instax Mini film is definitely worth considering.

I feel good after being on this product for 2 months now. Of course it is impossible to say it is 100% from taking Materna everyday but I can say it is at least beneficial. I am pregnant and this prenatal is very convenient to take as it contains a lot of vitamins I am deficient in.Also good amount for the money I spent. Will continue to take these even after giving birth

Doctor Recommended- For real.
Reviewed in Canada on September 26, 2021Verified Purchase
My doctor gave me a sample packet of this medication, and I found it much easier than swallowing the bag of separate vitamins and minerals like I had been doing before getting a recommendation.They are very easy to swallow with water, and they sit in my stomach well... not causing an upset stomach or triggering my morning sickness, like with some other pills.My doctor referred to him as the ""gold standard"" and I can understand why. They are loaded with goodness-- though, I still take extra folic acid as one of these pills does not provide enough folic acid if you're potentially carrying twins (and you should be taking this med well before finding out if you are carrying one or multiples). Once it is determined that only one is in there, the folic acid content will be good enough for 1 baby.I signed up for a subscription to these, as they are good for after the baby comes, too... and they are also listed as a good option for ladies who may become pregnant.

Excellent portable charger when Quickcharge and travelling ultra light are not important
Reviewed in Canada on June 22, 2016Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
As an avid nature photographer, I often find myself off the grid, with no or limited access to power sources for charging my phone, camera, and other portable electronic devices. A friend of mine recommended the Anker portable charging devices, so I decided to give them a try. Here I will review the PowerCore 20100.PACKAGING: I’m not usually one to care about how a product is packaged (as long it isn’t damaged in transit) - but I have to say, Anker has done a superb job packaging this thing. Maybe not quite at the Apple level, but not too far from it. As soon as you open the box, you get the impression this is a premium product.BUILD QUALITY: I’m extremely impressed with the build quality of this product, especially given its very reasonable (dare I say low) price. It feels very dense and solid, while not being unreasonably heavy. At 358 g + 10 g (pouch) + 14 g (cable), this may be getting a bit heavy for hiking/backpacking trips, but is quite lightweight for just about anything else (car/plane travel, car camping, etc.). Speaking of the pouch, this is probably the best soft carrying pouch I’ve ever seen included with an electronics product. It’s made of a nice lightweight mesh, which is lined internally with a thin foam padding that gives added protection against bumps and drops. The USB A ports seem to be of really nice quality, and have a great feel to them when you insert a USB plug into them. This model has two USB ports, allowing charging of 2 devices (at up to 2.4A each) simultaneously - this is a very nice feature to save time when multiple devices need to be charged. The device has a small 4-light LED indicator that provides information on the current charge level, which is very useful for knowing how much juice is left in the battery pack. While not charging or being charged, pressing a small button on the side of the device will activate the LED indicator. The only minor complaint I have is that plugging a cable into the micro USB port is a little more resistant and finicky than I’d like.CHARGING: When using this device to charge my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (3600 mAh battery), I get an average charging rate of about 1.3 minutes per % (so about 130 min. to fully charge the phone). This rate is similar to what I get from standard (non-fast charge) 2A wall chargers. The PowerCore has the capacity to fully charge the phone just under 4 times, which is expected given the 60-70% efficiency quoted by Anker on their website. In terms of how long it takes to recharge the PowerCore itself, it takes about 11.5 hours to go from empty to full (using a 2A USB charger). One nice feature to point out is that there is no on/off switch - when you plug in a device, it starts charging, and when you unplug it, it stops. So no need to worry about forgetting to turn the charger on or off.PROS:- Very well built, and seemingly durable- Reasonable weight, given the charge capacity- Good length micro USB cable and excellent quality carrying/storage pouch included- Charge level indicator- Charges devices at a good rate- Does not need to be switched on/offCONS:- Time to recharge the PowerCore 20100 is somewhat on the long side, making things a bit tricky. For example, if you wanted to charge overnight, you’d need to start it charging a couple of hours before going to bed, and leave it charging for a couple more hours after waking up - this is a bit awkward.CONCLUSION: Overall, I’m very impressed with this product. It appears to be a high quality product that offers a great set of features. No, it doesn’t have Quickcharge capability (either for charging or for being charged), but given its low price, it offers excellent value. Unless Quickcharge is important to you, I would highly recommend this battery pack to people looking for a super convenient way to charge their electronic devices while travelling.PICTURES: Among the attached pictures, I’ve included one of the PowerCore 20100 beside a credit card, and another of it beside the PowerCore 10000, to give a relative sense of size.

One of The Best Portable Chargers, EVER!
Reviewed in Canada on April 14, 2016Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
This is probably the best battery pack and I was lucky enough for Anker to send me one. Let me explain why! When you first get this portable you're presented professionally with a small box containing the power bank, micro USB and nice looking case. It's really considerate when a company such as Anker include a pamphlet that makes sure the customer is satisfied and doesn't have any problems. The power bank itself is noticeably heavy but for how much mAh it holds, it's definitely worth it. It can charge my Nexus 5 about 6 times by itself and could probably charge an iPhone 6 around the same amount of times. The charging speed on this is amazing as well. If your phone doesn't support Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0 then you definitely need to get this. Examples of phones would be the Nexus 5 and iPhone's. It charges extremely fast, charging my Nexus from 0-100% in about 50 minutes to an hour. That's amazing considering it doesn't support quick charge 2.0. I used ampere to measure the amount of amps travelling through the cable and it's usually around 1500mAh which is a very high speed. The portable bank itself charges in about 8 hours from being dead which may seem long until you consider, as stated before, how big the actual battery is. The material on the portable bank is a nice matte feeling black that is nice to hold in the hand. One issue I encountered with this choice of material is that it scratches easily but it does come with a carrying case that would protect it from such damage. There are 2 USB ports so you can charge 2 devices at once and it uses 4 LED's to determine how much power is left. 4 on meaning 80-full and 1 while blinking meaning dead or soon to be. If you're not satisfied with your product for any reason Anker is nice enough to include a crazy long warranty where they'll try to work at an agreement with you. Whether that's sending you another one because your's was defected our just plain out giving you a refund. Anker is highly considerate to their customers and that's one of my favourite things about them. Overall I think anyone who has a phone with a bad battery such as mine should consider this. You won't be able to carry it in your pocket but at least you'll have more power then anyone beside you!

Possibly the best clean available
Reviewed in Canada on May 5, 2020Verified Purchase
I've worn contacts for 20+ years and survived nightmares like the b&l cleaning fluid recalls and bad batches of lenses. I was really sick of having to use a protein remover as well as cleaning fluid on my contacts (monthlies) just to hope for a comfortable feel, they would always feel gritty after a few days so I tried clear care and it made my contacts feel really good every single day which was a very nice change. The fluid itself of course cannot be used as a rinse but my lenses didn't really need it anymore. The main ingredient is hydrogen peroxide so your lenses are being sanitized better than any regular rinse and clean type fluids, the downside is you need to wait for the chemical reaction in the container which takes time to change into a harmless saline fluid.I had a really bad infection from a bad batch of contacts (fluid was contaminated) so ever since I make a point of putting a brand new pair through the cleaning cycle out of the pack instead of just popping them in.Be safe guys you only get one pair of eyes, and make sure to read the instructions for Clear Care or you will burn your eyeballs if you use the fluid straight without letting it react the designated time in the provided containers.

LikesGets about 550 FPS in any game at 1920x1080 resolution and 475 at 8K while staying under 65 degrees Celsius.Very easy to Install as it only took 3 minutes.It has not crashed, and it's been running smoothly.You can hardly tell the fans are spinning when under the road as they make no noise.It is not too heavy and i didn’t use the sag bracket to support it.Fur markUsing Fur mark, I got an average fps of 1010 FPS at 1920x1080 144hzat 41% fan utilization, 8500mhz, 65 degrees Celsius, and 12% power usage.Easy to stream and record videos as this GPU comes with NVIDIA DLSS 3, NVIDIA Reflex, NVIDIA Broadcast, and NVIDIA Encoder.It only needs a single 8-pin power connector.DislikesI feel that this GPU should have had 16 gigabytes of VRAM instead of 8 as that is not enough for most AAA titles nowadays.

Great Card For The Price!
Reviewed in Canada on March 13, 2024Verified Purchase
Not much to say about this card. I've trusted in MSI's GPU products for a lifetime, and they have never let me down.The MSI RTX 4060 Ventus is a great card overall on a budget. It's miles better than my old MSI GTX 1070 TI DUKE. Without Ray Tracing enabled, all games can be played very well in 1080p with maxed out settings. Once you get into Ray Tracing, and anything over 1080p you can take a performance hit, but games for the most part still perform really well if you have the correct settings. The power consumption is very low on the new series as well, which is great. It's very light weight, and it will not sag on your motherboard.Haven't had any real issues with it yet, but two things are worth noting. The first is that I think I'm going to have to warranty it, because one of the fans sounds like it might have a bad bearing. The second is that in some games with high usage I'm getting coil whine and it can be loud at times, like in HellDivers 2. This is normal, and I'm wearing headphones when gaming so it's not really a problem.

Work very well.
Reviewed in Canada on March 14, 2024Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I have long and thick hair with unmanageable curls. Straightening them has been a task and time consuming and often not very long lasting.First off normal straightening irons took me at least an hour to do my entire head and not completely straightened. To do a very good job usually required someone to do the back of my head.With this my hair was straightened in about 20 minutes and giving it an extra 10 minutes made my hair extra straight and also soft.The bush doesn’t get extra hot so I can get it close to my head. And I have no fear of burning my hand when I can’t quite see what I am doing in the back of my head. The only thing that gets very hot is the hair (probably why they give you that glove with it to catch your hair) since I use a wide comb to both section my hair and catch the hit strands this makes the entire process much faster.Also helps that I don’t need to go over the same strand of hair 5-6 times. This one I don’t even need it to be at the highest temps and the most unruly strand still looks decent after two pass and a third for good measure.Other note worthy thing is that my hair has remained very straight for many days even if I had a pony tail for a few days I can comb it out and it still looks pretty good.And if need be I can plug it the straightener and give my hair a quick “brush” and that settles down even the bump of the pony tail in about 5 minutes.I purchased it from seeing a bunch of adverts all over social media and really wasn’t expecting much.  I wasn’t even sure it would be a nice experience as some that I have tried basically was ripping my hair and breaking the hair causing more damage than anything.My hair not only is not being brittled but is left silky and smooth after using.  Well worth it for me.

Solid performance; runs cool except under load
Reviewed in Canada on July 24, 2023Style: Processor OnlyVerified Purchase
This processor performs well and is a solid performance upgrade from my old i7-6700K. According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan):- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in “eco” mode in my motherboard’s settings- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirectorNote that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).If you don’t need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium. If you also don’t plan to overclock, consider the i7-13700F.

Reviewed in Canada on September 13, 2020Verified Purchase
I was hesitant to purchase used items online  so I messaged the seller before I bought the Wii Fit Plus with Balance Board.  The seller responded to me quickly and answered my questions about the condition of the items.  The board and disc arrived in mint condition, better than what I was expecting as it is a used item.  I tested it out for a couple of hours and it works perfectly!  Very pleased with the items and the seller!

Amazing exergame!
Reviewed in Canada on February 9, 2011Verified Purchase
As someone who works overnight shift work and really didn't manage to grasp the concept of exercise FULLY, the Wii fit got me on the right path. Even a few minutes a day can help with balance (which I'm now fully aware of at ALL times..I say as I'm correcting my slouch) and the Wii Fit Plus games are just hilarious to do. I've gotten my fiancee in on it and we do yoga together.Since I've gotten the Wii Fit, done it regularly (read: EVERY day) and watched my eating habits, I've dropped almost 10 lbs in less than 2 months. Although that doesn't seem like a lot to most, the wonderful thing is..It will STAY off instead of a rapid loss (which can lead to rebounding and weight gain).It's not going to make you insanely buff (for example, for the tricep extension I use my free weights since I've been working out for a while and feel using the Wii-mote is a little ridiculous) but it's a great way to get motivated, it's so much fun and it's a good start to a healthy lifestyle.

When I received this product I was expecting a refurbished product, don't get me wrong. However the controller was filthy for one.  Secondly the B button and the start button were so filthy I had to tear it apart and clean it, the start button actually didn't work at all even after cleaning it. The left button switch didn't respond and needed to be replaced. And if that wasn't enough the left analog stick didn't work either and I had to replace this as well.

I was not disappointed by the M50XThey're very comfortable to wear, with soft ear pads and an adjustable headband. They are also very durable, with a sturdy metal frame and detachable cables. The sound quality is amazing, with clear highs, mids and lows. The bass is not overpowering. The soundstage is wide and immersive, with excellent separation and detail.

One of the best within this price point - but NOT ideal for bassheads
Reviewed in Canada on November 18, 2016Colour Name: BlackStyle: WiredPattern Name: HeadphoneVerified Purchase
I have quite a few headphones to compare and the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x excels in clarity, mostly in mids and highs. It is meant for studio use and that means it does not artificially alters the sound source and thus this is not a headphone for baseheads. The sound signature is pure, cristal clear, with competent bass, but not overpowering the other frequencies. This is not going to rumble your head with the sub-base that you can not hear but only feel. But that is not to say that the bass is not good, because it is - just do not expect extra bass added to your tracks. What you can expect instead is to rediscover your favorite songs, with added clarity, resolution and details. Treeble and midrange are as good as you can get for this price point, and the only other eadphone I like better at this price point, precisely because it has a warmer signature, with more pronounced bass, is thie V-Moda Crossfade M-100. So, despite preferring the signature of the M-100, which is more powerful and impactful, with that deep sub-bass that rumbles your head, the M50x is an amazing headphone that has mode forward and crital midrange and treeble than the M-100, whch has become my favorite benchmark for this price point.As far as build quality, the M50x is well built and feels solid in your hand, but that is achieved due to the use of good quality plastics and metal on some key parts only. It does not feel premium, just feels well built. Kind of 7 out of 10 score at most. It is not meant to withstand the harshness of professional DJ work, instead is more focused on critical listening on studio environment, and I think it can easily handle this type of duty, but I also think it would not last very long in the hands of professional DJs, which are always throwing around their gear. But, the M50x is not meant for DJs, I am just mentioning this to make a point that the quality of the build is good, but is not excellent by any means.The M50x is very comfortable to use and the ear pads have enough room to completely go around your ears, so there is no discomfort of having your ears pressed by the ear pads on some parts. It is very comfortable indeed.Hope this shor treview helps and in the end, it is very hard to regret buying this headphone - expect for bassheads I would say.

Much easier to put together than a traditional ginger bread house in my opinion. It came with plastic supports so it was a total breeze to put together which made it more fun and engaging for my toddler rather than frustrating for us both lol. It came with so many fun additions like sprinkles and icing, and the Kitkat Santa and smarties. It was so much to put together while we watched a holiday movie but it was even more fun to eat it after!. With traditional ginger bread we never really got around to eating it, I always found them dry and just not fun to eat but this way it didn’t go to waste and was delicious ontop of a fun family activity!. Definitely wanting to get one next year for the tradition!

Great unless you have a big head
Reviewed in Canada on October 24, 2023Verified Purchase
See first about a new revision:There has been a silent revision that people have measured to affect the sound (partly because of a change in the pads). It doesn't necessarily sound worse now, but the bass is slightly louder (a plus for open backs IMHO) and the treble peak has been lowered slightly, which was something people previously complained about so it seems like the new revision improves things. Some have described it as how it would've sounded when EQ'd to flatten the response. There have been some material changes, with the top pad covered in cloth now (unnoticeable unless you're bald) instead of velour and the earpads are softer (a plus in my book). Silent revisions aren't great because measurements by review sites like Rtings are no longer accurate but the changes to the sound seem like good ones here.Sound quality is good for the price with a much flatter sound profile than most headphones (including the bass, a rare thing in cheap open backs).Comfort is decent, apparently better on the new revision because of the softer pads although the clamping force is pretty tight so people with big heads may not find them comfortable. I have a normal sized head and don't feel any discomfort.The cable is another thing that was changed in the revision and I'd say it's a great cable. Not overly long (I wouldn't have minded a longer one though) but it's very soft and doesn't keep its shape. I've actually never had anything with such a soft cable. Feels like a big noodle. The end was changed to a screw on 6.5mm adapter that you can remove to get a regular 3.5mm jack.Overall I really like them. I think my choice not to go with the HD6XX from Massdrop/Sennheiser was a good one, especially with the price difference when buying from Massdrop from Canada (customs, shipping, etc)

Get These For the Imaging and Soundstage
Reviewed in Canada on October 27, 2023Verified Purchase
After thoroughly listening to these headphones for a week I'm ready to put together my thoughts. The headphone having a neutral sound signature have excellent sound quality, the lows, mids, and highs produced by these headphones are extremely clear. I had high expectations for the sound clarity and they definitely meet them, however, the difference is not huge when comparing to an also capable pair of headphones that cost less than this. I appreciate the more realistic tones of instruments in the treble range and enjoy the ""texture"" of vocals that is emphasized due to the flat sound signature. I do not feel that the flatness affects enjoyment of music at all. Overall these headphones are better in clarity than typical consumer audio but that is not the reason to consider them.What really makes these headphones stand out though is how well it does for instrument separation. They have an outstanding ability to resolve every instrument and separate vocals just like the musician intended. The perceived soundstage from the open back design provides a really immersive experience that had me hooked from the first listen. It really is that good.I would also like to note that some reviews point out the bass lacking a little, I did not find that to be the case. The bass has great extension and control in songs that intend on emphasizing the bass, although, it is still not as loud as some headphones that focus on the bass. As someone who enjoys good bass in music, I was impressed by their performance.In some online communities there seems to be an observation that there had been some cosmetic design changes to these headphones such as the headband. Although I cannot comment on the sound difference, perhaps my experience of the bass was a factor of these changes.

Reviewed in Canada on September 27, 2023Colour Name: SilverVerified Purchase
The Etekcity Digital Hanging Luggage Scale has been an absolute game-changer for my travels. This portable handheld scale offers a level of convenience and reliability that every traveler can appreciate.First and foremost, the accuracy of this scale is impressive. It consistently provides precise weight readings, allowing me to avoid those dreaded overweight luggage fees at the airport. With a capacity of up to 110 pounds, it covers most travelers' needs, whether it's for a weekend getaway or an extended vacation.The build quality of this scale is top-notch. The rubber paint finish not only gives it a sleek and durable appearance but also provides a comfortable grip when handling heavy luggage. It feels sturdy and dependable, which is crucial when you're relying on it to assess the weight of your belongings.One of the standout features is the integrated temperature sensor. This addition allows you to check the temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius, which can be quite handy when traveling to different climates. It's a thoughtful and practical addition to an already fantastic product.

Espresso Machine - Affordable, Convenient, Delicious!
Reviewed in Canada on March 22, 2024Verified Purchase
We're really happy with our Philips 3200 Series Espresso Machine. It's affordable, packed with great features, and offers a nice selection of drinks. The coffee it makes is delicious, and the milk container is super handy. It makes really good milk foam, and you can easily take it apart and put it in the dishwasher for cleaning. Keeping the machine clean is also easy because you can remove the brewing unit and drip tray. We love having it in our kitchen and wouldn't want to be without it!

 if you are considering this machine, I would like to share some of my experiences with you, pre-owner and new buyer. You might knew those tricks if you’ve read the manual.  my Little Summary of “Press and hold for 3 seconds” with the following buttons under “Power Off” are able to change some hidden feature settings …. suits  EP3241/54  1) Aroma = Water Hardness Soft1>Hard4.  2) Quantity = Water Temperature Low>default>High.  3) Aqua = Activate Aqua-Filter.  4) Calc = Auto-off timer 15/30*/60/180mins.  5) Espresso = Restore factory setting.  6) Coffee = On/off panel Beep Sound.  this LatteGo automatic espresso machine is super easy to make cappuccino under 3 mins from power On. and Super easy to clean up too. It’s make noise but not really loud enough to wake anybody in the morning. It’s gave me really fast, tasty and creamy espresso as always.  if you knew how to use “Bypass” feature …  “Press and hold 3’s ” on the “Pre-ground/Aroma” to bypass the grinder on Latte Macchiato can easily get “Hot Milk only” and same way to get “Foam Milk only” on Cappuccino.  so far, for the past 5 months I just have to refill coffee beans and fill up the water tank at the Front side when it’s empty.  Do “Maintains it” just take a minute to drain the drip tray and empty the bin after every use, and also took about 5-10mins to rinse the brew unit weekly.  Wait 5 seconds to “Reset the built-in counter” when took out the Drip tray under Power On as always. Otherwise it’s will keep LED remind you to empty the bin after every 8-10 shots.  The coffee spout is adjustable to fit most travel mug not taller than 16cm which is big plus to me.  And all beverages are able to program it’s own quantity size from 50-250ml but at least larger than the default size. all details is on the manual.  be cautious with the Aqua-filters, it’s needs to be fully filled water and lets bobbles completely out before installation, otherwise you may get trouble with the water intake cause by the air block.and the running cost, according to the manual that Aqua-Filter needs to be replace every 3 months or every 95L of water ( >1,000 cups), It’s means I need to replace Aqua-filters x4 per year. That’s about 25cents per day for Filters and each shot of the 10g coffee beans cost about10-20cents. Total is just Less than $2 per day for me to make 6-8 shots espresso daily. (I like Melitta and Lavazza beans both not oily) Lastly, For the past 5 months I did once filter change already and did descaling once just follow with the Philips you-tube instructions step by step easily. the machine still works very great.

Reviewed in Canada on November 8, 2021Colour Name: RedVerified Purchase
So three years ago, I used to have a 3DS XL (blue), but it got stolen by a former roommate, along with all my games and my professional camera. Losing these made me pretty depressed as they were sentimental. I recently decided to take a gamble and get this 3DS, and I’m so glad I did. It had normal wear and tear on the cover, but everything else worked perfectly. The charger is also loose but not a big deal. It also came with a 16G SD card, which I’m not complaining at all! It doesn’t bring all the things that were stolen from me back, but it sure is a start to build up my collection.

Good 3ds, shipping took a bit but it didn't come from my country. There's damage to the outside of the console, though minor and it's just corner damage, does not interfere with gameplay. It was cleaned well enough. There are gouges to the bottom but they don't really matter, but the sin number was torn off. Overall tho, good deal for a 3ds, especially a pink one.

Reviewed in Canada on November 24, 2023Verified Purchase
These things are pretty good. As some people who get cold sores know, they can be embarrassing. I am always so paranoid I have touched it without realizing and spread it more to myself or someone else. Putting this patch on provides what I feel like is a nice barrier between the sore and anything else. It doesn't help speed up the process necessarily so much faster, but as we all know, not a lot of stuff does. What's great about them though is they do help a bit, and when you put one on it REALLY camouflages the sore! Nothing is worse than a huge red mark on your lip! This thing makes it actually hard to see. My only reason for the 4 star, is the adhesive. This is something that will stick to the sore well. You have to be careful taking it off. I wait till I am in the shower and the water will gently take it off. You don't want to aggravate the sore more.  But where mine is located, the patch will go a little on the skin and a little on the lip. Once you talk, sip a beverage, yawn, the part that should stick to your lip doesn't stay. This is more something you want to put on before bed, or when you don't have to go anywhere.

I DON'T EVEN USE THEM FOR COLD SORES
Reviewed in Canada on July 12, 2021Verified Purchase
I have purchased these many times and I don't even use them for cold sores, I have bad rosacea acne, mainly on my forehead and temple area of my face and these patches definitely help the healing process, they don't completely heal the acne, but they cut down on the healing time. I only wish there were multiple sizes or a larger quantity, they are much better and less expensive than the Polysporin ones. From Canada they usually only take two weeks to arrive. As for using them for what they are sold for, you can't have any facial hair where they are being applied to. They are a very convenient way to speed healing to any cut or lesion on the face and they work better than any cream or ointment.

Reviewed in Canada on January 8, 2024Size: Portable Lock 1.0Unit count: 1Verified Purchase
Since buying this I have purchased three more. I take these locks absolutely everywhere when I am travelling. Amazing for peace of mind and an extra ounce of safety. You could use them in your own home if you felt you needed that extra protection. I have used them in airbnbs, hotels and other places I want extra security. I bought more and put them on every door I encounter when travelling. They are easy to install and remove. They are discrete and durable. A single lock comes with instructions and a case. I do want to be upfront and mention they do not ALWAYS fit every door/lock. Say out of 50 times I have encountered 3-4 doors where the doorway is too deep to fit the lock correctly. In these cases you would need one of the poles that secure the handle to the floor. Having said that I RARELY have that issue and would absolutely recommend these locks. Friends I travel with request I bring them with us. I really cannot rave about these locks enough. Do yourself a favour and grab a few. They aren’t expensive and your safety and peace of mind will thank you later.

            Since buying this I have purchased three more. I take these locks absolutely everywhere when I am travelling. Amazing for peace of mind and an extra ounce of safety. You could use them in your own home if you felt you needed that extra protection. I have used them in airbnbs, hotels and other places I want extra security. I bought more and put them on every door I encounter when travelling. They are easy to install and remove. They are discrete and durable. A single lock comes with instructions and a case. I do want to be upfront and mention they do not ALWAYS fit every door/lock. Say out of 50 times I have encountered 3-4 doors where the doorway is too deep to fit the lock correctly. In these cases you would need one of the poles that secure the handle to the floor. Having said that I RARELY have that issue and would absolutely recommend these locks. Friends I travel with request I bring them with us. I really cannot rave about these locks enough. Do yourself a favour and grab a few. They aren’t expensive and your safety and peace of mind will thank you later.

I think it is well made and good quality. Works on all my doors at home, outside and interior doors. Unfortunately on both of my trips it would not work on the hotel doors. I will keep and take to Italy next year and hope that it works. Live the convenient case it comes with. Easy to store in luggage.

Love the concept
Reviewed in Canada on July 15, 2023Size: Portable Lock 1.0Unit count: 1Verified Purchase
I previously wrote a review, but I hadn't really installed it. Just commenting on how it was a great concept. Well, since, I've installed it and it took a couple minutes. It actually worked very well. I was skeptical as to whether this little gadget would work. I loved the concept, but for it to work was another matter. It did. It gives that little extra piece of mind for safety especially when travelling. It's a compact easy to remove and re-install whenever you feel needed. It's sturdy, but lightweight. It comes with a little tote bag for travel or when taken off to place it in for safe keeping until you want to reinstall it. Certainly, highly recommend. The price was great as a bonus.Since I purchased this lock, I decided to buy another one for our Condo door. It's just that added piece of mind and since there's really no installation or need for drilling or tools, why not? I've also suggested to some single women I know to purchase this lock because it's so easy to use, cost effective and gives one that added piece of mind of safety. I wish this lock was out when I was younger, single and living alone or travelling. I think every single person should have one or if you want some privacy and want to lock a bedroom door, for instance, temporarily. As I said earlier, this is such a great concept.

Effective FINENIC Portable Door Lock for Home and Travel Safety
Reviewed in Canada on January 18, 2024Size: Portable Lock 1.0Unit count: 1Verified Purchase
The FINENIC Portable Door Lock for Home and Travel Safety is a remarkably simple and effective tool to enhance the security, and therefore safety of a room.It seems to work very well in my front door, and I plan to travel with the Portable Door Lock for use when staying at hotels.N.B. The description notes that the lock will NOT work for:1. Outward Swinging Doors2. Doors that have less than “a millimeter or so gap between the door and the door jamb”I would feel comfortable recommending this, as long as people note the method of correct usage (see two points noted above).

Fast delivery and works just fine. The battery is a bit weaker than a fresh Dsi of course, but if that becomes a problem then a replacement battery should do the trick. Dsi has no stylus as listed, but those can also be bought seperately. Seems like a good investment so far.

Fantastic condition for its price
Reviewed in Canada on March 21, 2021Verified Purchase
Obviously it depends on the seller and not on Amazon itself, but I got a bargain for my DSI XL I purchased recently. It came in its original box with all the paperwork and stylus and even included a carrying case and extra stylus. It was in a great condition overall minus a few scratches in one section of the lower screen, but that's to be expected with any used DS system. If you want to play original DS games with the best screen on original DS hardware this is definitely a pickup. DS Pokemon games have never looked so good!

For the Audiophile, probably not for the casual consumer
Reviewed in Canada on May 2, 2022Verified Purchase
Pros: This DAC-Amp is a legend in the r/headphones subreddit and the overall headphone/IEM audiophile community for a reason. It is lightweight, fairly convenient to use, measures well, sounds subjectively fine, and is CHEAP. As someone who owns the U12t, IER-Z1R, and is planning on buying the EE Odin and the Elysian Annihilator, I use the Apple dongle 99% of the time I am outside. Spend your money on IEMs and headphones, not the source.Cons: For non-audiophiles, this is a $9 bulky add-on that Apple randomly required you to buy by removing the headphone jack all those years ago. Use TWS or earbuds with a lightning connector at the end of them. It's a lot more convenient. Also, the build isn't the best and I have broken many dropping my phone. While you can reinforce them so they don't break (check the subreddit mentioned above for details), you shouldn't have to do that in the first place.Conclusion: For those of you looking to join the audiophile community, welcome! Buy this and a Chifi IEM and enjoy your music! Don't worry about the source. For those already deep into the community like me, you probably don't need a random internet stranger telling you how good the Apple dongle is. It's a legend for a reason. For those who don't care much about audio, this probably isn't for you. TWS have become significantly cheaper and will always be more convenient. As an audiophile with an iPhone though, I will continue using the Apple dongle until the day I am burried with one.

Seems nice, if the buttons don't wear out.
Reviewed in Canada on December 5, 2023Verified Purchase
Everything seems to be exactly as expected based on the product information and everyone's reviews. Bought it, put some anti-sweat gloves on, and hopped into a FFXIV ultimate raid. Felt like a good controller. My controller that came with the console started getting stick drift and after doing some ball-park math I realized that I probably spent $800 on PS4 replacement controllers, so hoping that this investment is a money saver in the long run.Of course, not every PS4 controller died to the Dreaded Drift, some actually had the buttons wear out, and I started Frankensteining the varying components from multiple controllers together. Like at one point I had the buttons from one that had screwed up shoulder triggers and the sticks from another that wouldn't charge because the usb port was mucked up pulled out to fix one with a good port/battery and shoulder triggers when the buttons went mushy and the stick started drifting. Hoping that a nearly $300 controller won't get mushy buttons, that would be ridiculous and embarrassing for Sony.I do distinctly enjoy that all of the screws holding the PS5 controllers (even the normal ones) are covered up and won't be exposed to sweat. Human skin oils and sweat are basically the most damaging thing besides literal acids or actual fire for practically anything, and I've had far too many PS3/PS4 controllers be irreparable because when I went to pull the screws out, they just desintegrated. I'm sure this was annoying even for Sony, or they wouldn't have bothered fixing it. If this gets mushy buttons and I have to pull the buttons out and replace them, I'll be back to edit this.

My SCUF lasted 5 months before repair 1 of 2.  The Edge controller is Quality
Reviewed in Canada on May 3, 2023Verified Purchase
This review is for the Edge controller but like many I looked at SCUF controllers also when deciding on what to purchase.  This is my experience with both controllers.I purchased a SCUF controller and ignored the quality concerns that others had voiced. I figured that with the high volume of sales, some faulty units were inevitable. Even when I discovered that SCUF only offers a 6-month warranty, I remained optimistic. Unfortunately, after just five months, the right trigger failed, and it took almost three weeks to repair - longer than the 12 days I was initially told it would take. Then, only a month later, the right stick began to drift. The controller quickly became unusable, rotating uncontrollably at the start of every Call of Duty match. After two failures in seven months, I couldn't justify spending an estimated $80 on another repair.When I received the SCUF controller, I expected it to be a PlayStation 5 controller with extra back buttons and customization options. However, I soon realized that it was an inferior product with cheap aftermarket buttons. Even SCUF's warranty page states that it will fail in six to eight months if you play for six hours a day, like any other controller. In contrast, I have PS4 controllers that have undergone three battery swaps and still work perfectly, as well as PS5 controllers that haven't failed in any way since their release.The Sony Edge controller, on the other hand, exudes quality the moment you hold it. Although I've only had it for a week, I'm confident that it will last as long as my other PlayStation controllers. If I do encounter stick drift, I can replace the part myself for about $40. Additionally, configuring the controller is straightforward and comes with two types of back buttons which is great. In my opinion, the Sony Edge is the clear choice.

Bough this instead of a wheel….
Reviewed in Canada on October 13, 2023Verified Purchase
So after contemplating to spend $400 + on a wheel and pedal Logitech - Thrustmaster only to research and find it’s half baked compared to DD wheel I came to the decision to purchase the EDGE.And for formula 1 ‘23 what a controller compared to the DualSense.Pros:Hard shell case and can charge while inside.Lengthy USB C cable braided. Be sure to take care with these cables. Very good quality. Try and roll them up the way they came or avoid twisting.I tried the paddles to play like shifters however muscle memory is an issue. I may try again and orientate downshift on the right and up shift on the left as acc and upshift and the vis versa are hard to coordinate. For now back to X 🔲 Also if you reverse the orientation of the paddles you can extend them further towards your palm.Comes with a nice locking mechanism to keep the provided wire in the controller. I don’t really think this may be useful as I have a 5 year old. Huge tripping hazard and the controller will go flying.Love the caps they come in various styles and lengths. This is great as finding the correct hight means your thumb doesn’t have to travel as far and precision can be greatly increased. I already have a cap that adds hight but I’ve maxed it out on the left stick and enjoy the amount of control it provides.The removable and replaceable joysticks are the best positive from Sony. Another reason over the wheel (I’ve already gone through two controller with heavy game use) I also find myself gripping the controller and left stick to find the precision. Old habits. Now to change the Stick I can swap and use the right one and then purchase a replacement. Save over buying a new controller.The trigger limiters are nice. I attempted to stiffen the brake trigger but I found I like the length of my break pedal similar to real world car.Apart from the hardware the software support of the controller is great. Right out of the box you can check and eliminate natural dead zone in the controller sticks. 3-5% is normal.There is also customization for stick responsiveness. Thinking linearly you can adjust the line to reflect how fast or how slow and how soon you want the responsive to be. My sensitivity curve is set to quickYou can also adjust the travel for the trigger in the software and the deadzone for that exact feel you want on the break or the accelerator.Cons.The battery seems to be an issue, I’ve discovered while researching. To combat this use the provided USB cable for power and communication as much as possible.You will prolong the longevity of your battery, just be sure to use the battery once in a while. You can also adjust the lights, force feedback and mic volumes to improve batter time and life.Set your communication from the controller to USB rather than Bluetooth. There is natural input lag in both, but direct connection is still the best way for data transfer.Other than that so far no cons. If you are an avid user of the PS5 I suggest purchase this controller instead of a wheel for your entry into F1 ‘23 unless you have the $$$$ for a DD wheel like Fanatec. Unfortunately they are the only company that will make direct drive wheel for PS5. And in my opinion and preferance a non DD wheel is half baked.

Another reason over the wheel (I’ve already gone through two controller with heavy game use) I also find myself gripping the controller and left stick to find the precision. Old habits. Now to change the Stick I can swap and use the right one and then purchase a replacement. Save over buying a new controller.The trigger limiters are nice. I attempted to stiffen the brake trigger but I found I like the length of my break pedal similar to real world car.Apart from the hardware the software support of the controller is great. Right out of the box you can check and eliminate natural dead zone in the controller sticks. 3-5% is normal.There is also customization for stick responsiveness. Thinking linearly you can adjust the line to reflect how fast or how slow and how soon you want the responsive to be. My sensitivity curve is set to quickYou can also adjust the travel for the trigger in the software and the deadzone for that exact feel you want on the break or the accelerator.Cons.The battery seems to be an issue, I’ve discovered while researching. To combat this use the provided USB cable for power and communication as much as possible.You will prolong the longevity of your battery, just be sure to use the battery once in a while. You can also adjust the lights, force feedback and mic volumes to improve batter time and life.Set your communication from the controller to USB rather than Bluetooth. There is natural input lag in both, but direct connection is still the best way for data transfer.Other than that so far no cons. If you are an avid user of the PS5 I suggest purchase this controller instead of a wheel for your entry into F1 ‘23 unless you have the $$$$ for a DD wheel like Fanatec. Unfortunately they are the only company that will make direct drive wheel for PS5. And in my opinion and preferance a non DD wheel is half baked.

Cappuccino good, Mocha bad.
Reviewed in Canada on October 18, 2022Style: Instant CappuccinoFlavour Name: French Vanilla CappuccinoSize: 454 g (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
In regards to the instant cappuccino mix: This mix is so good! I tried it years ago and was iffy about buying it, but I'm very glad I did. I think they have improved it since the last time I had it. The taste is great. It’s not too sweet, and the mix dissolves completely, so there are no gritty granules left. And I add a small amount of half n half cream after stirring in the water. I think ill be buying this on a regular basis. It has cut down on my Starbucks trips! So I'm also saving money. That’s a win win! To make it more coffee flavored I add a teaspoon of the Maxwell House instant coffee to three tablespoons of the cappuccino mix. Add water and cream until it tastes just right.However, the reason Im only giving this three stars is in regards to the Tim Hortons mocha mix. When I try to leave a review for the mocha, it brings me back to the review I left for the cappuccino. So I guess I can only leave one review for both products. Which is unfortunate. Because I would have given the cappuccino mix five stars and I would’ve given the mocha one star. So that’s how we get to the three star rating.The mocha comes in a box and inside the box you have eight packets of individual servings. You put it in a mug you add your hot water you can add some milk if you want, but it tastes horrible. It tastes like im adding terrible hot chocolate and terrible coffee together and you get this dark brown gritty mixture that is not good at all . I do not recommend the Tim Hortons instant mocha mix. Do not buy it.

I researched how to make Dashi stock, then I found this Ajinomoto - Hon Dashi (Soup Stock) and decided to give it try as I didn't want to invest the time to make the stock from scratch. Followed the instructions on package, and the result was a very authentic taste. And it doesn't take much power to make 4 cups of miso, so I think the cost is good value.

My husband and I wanted to spice things up with these chocolates, we ordered 3 boxes from the website. We planned a sensual night where we each took a half and went on our way, he had to be out, and I stayed home. He came back two hours later and we both agreed we felt no different so we had another chocolate, that’s one who square and a half each. We had se x, honestly it was great but we know it had nothing to do with the chocolate. After everything I had the WORST anxiety, I couldn’t breathe properly and it felt like all my already heavy life burdens became even more heavier. Not funn. However, my husband last night thought that maybe we didn’t give them a good of enough chance and he too THREE! Now he is experiencing the same thing I did. Learn from our mistakes, these are a scam and you should neverrrrr take more that one square because they’re honestly scary. The amount of caffeine is ridiculous.

Have using this brushes for years, they do a good job cleaning between teeth, only flaw, because the brush’s are conical which make easy to introduce between teeth, the conical factor does not clean equally the gums on the inside of your mouth and to get a good job donne you have to introduce the brush on both sides.

GUM Brushes - Two Thumbs Up for Green and One up for Yellow
Reviewed in Canada on January 24, 2024Style: TightSize: 1 count (Pack of 8)Colour Name: GreenVerified Purchase
It seems I can't review each brush separately...I bought GUM Proxabrush (yellow/moderate) and interdental (green/tight) on the recommendation of my periodontist.  I had never tried or even heard of them before this.  I like GUM's green/tight Go-Betweens Interdental Brushes and feel like they do a great job at removing plaque in those tough-to-reach places between my teeth.  They're easy to use and they feel good.  Interdental brushes are not a replacement for flossing, but an added way to keep your teeth free of plaque.However, I am not a fan of the yellow/moderate brushes for wider gaps between my teeth.  Three times, the wire brush has snapped off from its base.  The wire doesn't have enough flexibility or it needs to be stronger.Replacing these brushes these yellow brushes that don't last long enough, could become costly at this rate.

 Beautiful and no taste ! When the glitter settles to the bottom, just swirl the drink with a spoon or a straw and the magic starts again ! A little goes a LONG way. More glitter gives you a shimmery swirl effect in the drink while less glitter just gives a beautiful floating sparkle effect.I took the white color because it's versatile. (In the video, the blue-green is the actual color of the tea, not of the glitter.)I just wish Prime would cover all colors. I SO wanted to get the blue iridescent and the rose gold, but the shipping isn't cheap since the company is U.S. based (if I'm not mistaking).Anyway, very happy with my purchase ! Would buy again !

Fun if you're willing to purchase add-ins
Reviewed in Canada on December 19, 2023Style: Squishy MakerVerified Purchase
I bought this for my daughter's 7th birthday. The kit comes with curling ribbon (useless), 2 packs of tissue paper confetti (also useless- why would anyone think this would be good in liquid?), and 2 packs of plastic, shiny confetti (useful). So, most of the decorative elements were very cheap and throw-aways. Even though all of the promotional images of this toy show brightly colored squishies, it does not come with any type of coloring- that was disappointing. To make this more fun and a lengthier activity, I would suggest having food coloring and additional glitter + add-ins. I bought a variety pack of add-ins on Amazon which included multiple types of glitter, plastic beads, confetti in various shapes, foam beads, and clay/polymer shapes- advertised as slime add-ins. This toy wouldn't have been nearly as fun without the additional items I purchased- my daughter loves thinking of themes and adding tons of glitter, confetti, and a few drops food coloring to her squishies. The first two we made did bust within an hour of play- I started noticing tiny holes where the insides were leaking through and they eventually burst open. They were also leaking through the top, as the included clips do not create a great seal, especially if your child keeps picking up the squishy from the end of the balloon, stretching out the twisted clipped part. I found that tying the end of the balloon in a knot was much more effective, and was more fun to squish without the hard plastic clip. It does take some practice to tie the balloon however, my fingers often hurt after a few tries of stretching the balloon enough to get a knot. The next 2 squishies we made were smaller (used the small size rather than medium), and gave my daughter instructions to not step on them anymore- those squishies are going on 3 weeks with no leaks! We store them in plastic bags just in case. These are a pain to clean out of carpet- make sure your child knows to put them into a bowl or bag after play!I do not find it that messy as compared to a lot of craft kits out there, unless of course your squishy bursts. Otherwise, all the things go inside the inflated balloon, you tie it up, and done. Not much clean up. Overall, a fun concept, and my daughter really loves it!

Disappointing
Reviewed in Canada on May 3, 2023Style: Squishy MakerVerified Purchase
My daughter asked for this for Christmas, only a few of the squishy skins worked the rest tore, we can’t get refills anywhere, I emailed BOTI a month ago with no response. My daughter watches all Dr.Squish’s videos on Instagram and was so excited to try it and it’s such a huge let down. We’ve tried regular balloons but “clear” balloons aren’t as clear as the squishy skins. To me, it’s a waste of money.Update: still can’t get a response from BOTI. The refill kit I found on Amazon was outrageously expensive (more expensive than rebuying the machine that came with the same amount of stuff as the refill pack). The squishies quickly get holes, the clips are poorly designed, this is large, clunky, plastic, garbage.

I wish I could write a great review because the product concept itself is really cool, however the squishies just leak all over the place. And no it’s not from over filling or or tying them incorrectly. After a while (I’m talking a few hours) a small hole will form. I tested this out by making one myself and putting it away and lo and behold, it leaked everywhere.

Works if you’re patient
Reviewed in Canada on May 14, 2023Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I saw a bunch of negative reviews that this doesn’t work, but I washed my hair, blow dried and straightened it (I have naturally wavy hair) and the product worked great for me. Some of the hairs don’t get caught in the tray and end up falling on the counter so there is a bit of a mess, but I love that I can give myself trims while I’m growing out my hair. I have a lot of chemically damaged ends and my hair was noticeably softer after several passes.My hair is quite thick so it ended up taking me a little over an hour to do my head thoroughly

It works!!
Reviewed in Canada on March 4, 2021Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Fully charged in half an hourCame fast and I thin 2 days through prime shipping which is always awesome, the faster the better!Box is great, accessories are great. To first use it you must charge it, a full charge only takes 30mins, yeah pretty sweet!! It’s a bit noisy but that doesn’t bother me much. I had to do thin sections bc if I went with bigger my hair would get stuck when I pulled down on the trimmer. How it works is you open the clamps, start at the top of your head, squeeze and slowly pull down til you reach the end. At this point there should be a few hairs so you can see that it’s working. Instantly noticed a difference after doing one section, it felt lighter and softer and looked better. My only complaint is that it needs to do a better job of containing the hair as there were little pieces all over my clothes and in the sink leaving me with that poking feeling. Overall I’d give this product 5 stars. It’s worth every penny and will save you money in the long run because you won’t have to go to a hair dresser to get your hair trimmed all the time and it doesn’t compromise length so that’s a bonus!

Definitely gets rid of split ends and instantly made my hair feel better, but as someone else mentioned, a few weeks later my hair seemed to have splits much higher up the hair shaft. Not a lot, and likely only noticeable to me. I’ve used it twice about 7ish weeks apart and will continue to use it, but monitor my overall hair health and stop if I continue to see it happening. Worth it? I think so. Would I recommend it? With caution.

I read all of the reviews before buying this. 50% said it was great and the other 50% said run. Can confirm that both are correct. This trimmer works beautifully on the healthier sections of my hair but on the parts that are very dry, I had to go over about 5 or 6 times to get anything. And it only worked on part of the dry hair, the rest either didnt change much or the ends looked a bit worse off than before. Overall, will continue to use this split end hair trimmer in future. Now to solve my dry hair problem ...**Update. It's been a few days and it definitely damaged my dry hair. See attached picture. The hair is splitting in several spots higher up on the strand now.

A Game-Changer for ADHD Focus
Reviewed in Canada on April 3, 2024Verified Purchase
As a parent of a child with ADHD, finding effective tools to help manage distractions and improve focus has always been a priority. That's why I was thrilled to discover Loop Quiet Earplugs, and they have truly been a game-changer for both my daughter and myself.Initially purchased for my daughter, who struggles with ADHD-related sensory sensitivities, the Loop Quiet Earplugs quickly became an indispensable tool in her daily routine. The ability to drown out extra noise in the classroom or office environment has significantly improved her ability to concentrate and stay focused on tasks at hand. The difference in her attention span and productivity has been remarkable since incorporating Loop Quiet Earplugs into her daily routine.Inspired by my daughter's positive experience, I decided to try Loop Quiet Earplugs for myself, and I have been equally impressed with the results. As someone with ADHD, I often find myself easily distracted by background noise in busy environments. With Loop Quiet Earplugs, I can effectively block out distractions and create a quieter, more conducive workspace that allows me to focus on the task at hand.One of the standout features of Loop Quiet Earplugs is their effectiveness in reducing noise without completely blocking out all sound. This allows for a more natural listening experience while still providing the benefits of noise reduction. Additionally, the earplugs are comfortable to wear for extended periods, making them suitable for all-day use.While the performance of Loop Quiet Earplugs is exceptional, I do have one minor suggestion for improvement: a better case for storage and portability. A sturdier case would help ensure that users always have their Loop Quiet Earplugs on hand when they need them, whether at school, work, or on the go.In summary, Loop Quiet Earplugs are a must-have for anyone seeking to improve focus and concentration in noisy environments, particularly individuals with ADHD. Their effectiveness, comfort, and convenience make them an invaluable tool for managing sensory sensitivities and enhancing productivity. With just a small improvement to the case, Loop Quiet Earplugs would be the perfect solution for anyone in need of quiet, focused concentration.Pros:- Effective at reducing noise and improving focus- Comfortable for extended wear- Suitable for individuals with ADHD and sensory sensitivities- Allows for natural listening experienceCons:- Case could be sturdier for improved portabilityOverall, Loop Quiet Earplugs have been a game-changer for both my daughter and myself, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to enhance focus and concentration in noisy environments.

I was always afraid to try earplugs as I am always terrified of missing my alarm, but I don't worry about it with these.My *only* gripe is with how hard it is to change the tips, they are quite flexible being silicone so you really have to push it on.Otherwise I am very pleased.Recommend reading reviews thoroughly before purchase make sure these are right for you, don't expect miracles.

 The loop quiet earplugs do great for what they are for. The packaging was great, well designed and gives a kinda premium unboxing experience. It’s great how it includes 4 different ear sizes too otherwise this would not fit me, and many other people. Once I found my size I put them on and they felt a little bit weird in my ears. I decided to see how they felt when I was laying down, and that also felt weird. I eventually got used to the feeling and these have been super comfortable since then. I love how these come with a case to hold them since these would be very easy to lose if they did not have one. The earplugs also do not come off unless you do it yourself so you don’t need to worry about them falling out. I would rate it five starts but I did have some. Minor complaints. Firstly the ear tips were difficult to put in when changing sizes and secondly the it is difficult to open the carrying case and you need to put the earplugs in a very specific position to fit in the case. They get rid of most of the noise around me but I can still hear the louder noises at a decreased volume. I will definitely recommend these to friends and family since these are the best earplugs I have ever used.Pros:-comfortable to wear even when sleeping-comes with different ear tip sizes- has case so to keep  the earplugs together-they are waterproof and can be cleaned by putting them under the sink-keep most sounds out and makes very loud sounds more quiet-great build qualityCons:-rubber band loop on case is very weak-difficult to take off and put on the ear tips-a bit overpricedOverall these are fantastic earplugs and work better than the other options out there. If you need earplugs than these will be your best option.

Holds Well, However…4.0 out of 5 stars
Holds well, but gums up
Reviewed in Canada on January 6, 2024Style: Spiking GlueVerified Purchase
Product hold so well, super impressive, however the day I wore it I tried it on my eye brows like a lot of reviews said, but I found the gell/glue would get gummy and I had a hard time trying to get the clumpy bits to smooth out.

Used this for a kids dance performance and it worked great
Reviewed in Canada on March 23, 2024Style: Invincible Styling GelVerified Purchase
This kept all the flyaways stuck to my daughter's head during a dance showcase where she performed three dances and ran around with her friends for hours. It was also easy to wash out with a little shampoo and massage. We had to use a lot of it to ensure the hair was secure, so perhaps it made it more expensive. We liked it and will buy it again.

Great product but the price is volatile
Reviewed in Canada on September 29, 2023Style: Invincible Styling GelVerified Purchase
I really like this product. However, the price keeps fluctuating and it has only gone up in the past few months. Thats ok though... I can get a more competitive price elsewhere. Seller: Stop price gouging.

Lightweight which is perfect for packing light though it is a little on the bulky side of space is an issue. Appears well made and is easy to use with excellent neck support I've been missing in other travel pillows

Pricey for what it is, but perfectly executed and the only one I kept
Reviewed in Canada on April 4, 2024Colour Name: GreySize: AdultVerified Purchase
I purchased various other less costly options.. but this is the only one I kept.  The base model has fit me perfectly on 4 flights so far.  I am 6 ft tall and my 5.5 ft wife loves it too (read -  I may need to get her one).well done for the simplistic effective design that accommodates various positions and reduces neck strain, stiffness, etc by providing just enough support to not let your head fall to far forward or to the side.  I am sold!

Reviewed in Canada on March 19, 2024Colour Name: CoralSize: AdultVerified Purchase
I love that it is so lightweight, easy to attach to my suitcase so I cannot loose it.  Love the beautiful coral color too!So easy to use and works so well. No more stiff necks or unable to get comfortable enough to sleep. Can't wait to use again on my next trip to Europe.  Being able to sleep on an overseas flight makes the time adjustment so much easier.Great product!!

A little too expensive for the functionality
Reviewed in Canada on February 28, 2024Colour Name: GreySize: AdultVerified Purchase
The Trtl Pillow in Grey provides decent neck support for travel, but a couple of factors influenced my overall rating of 3 stars.Firstly, the pillow takes up a considerable amount of baggage space, making it less convenient for travel. Its size is something to consider, especially for those looking to optimize packing efficiency.Secondly, the cost of the Trtl Pillow is relatively high compared to similar products on the market. While it delivers on neck support, the price point may be a deterrent for budget-conscious travelers.In conclusion, the Trtl Pillow offers adequate comfort, but its size and cost impact its overall value. It might be worth considering if convenience and budget are not primary concerns for your travel needs.

Great Support for a head bobber
Reviewed in Canada on February 17, 2024Colour Name: BlackSize: AdultVerified Purchase
For someone who struggles with head bobbing on a plane, the TRTL is very comfortable support-wise to use while in the seated position. It's nice it comes with its own little travel bag, and I like how small it is. The only thing I don't LOVE about it is it is made with fleece, so can feel a bit stuffy - however I've noticed they sell the cooling version as well. I'd buy this again though, great for what I need it for.

Travel Pillow is compact and lightweight.
Reviewed in Canada on March 29, 2024Colour Name: BlackSize: AdultVerified Purchase
I recently ordered this product and it arrived in less than a week in brand new condition. It also includes a travel pouch and being lightweight also adds to it being compact. I haven’t used it yet but it seems more comfortable than the cheaper products I have bought before considering the material seems soft, but with higher quality considering its price tag.

Most Ergonomic Design
Reviewed in Canada on March 20, 2024Colour Name: BlackSize: AdultVerified Purchase
The product design and execution is the best, hands down this is better than any traditional neck pillow.Two highlights for me that stand out compared to standard neck pillows: first,  it doesn’t interfere with the back of your neck but still supports it so you can sit back all the way against the chair, second it’s very compact.Two things I wish it did have to make it just that much better is it could have more of an adjustable neck angle. Even though the angle it keeps your head at is pretty good,  sometime I like my head to be lower. Second, the padding could feel a bit more plush.I’d still hands down choose this pillow over the rest, but I’m looking for something that can accommodate everything.
