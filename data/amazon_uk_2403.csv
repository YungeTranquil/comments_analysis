I bought the Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote to upgrade my old TV and access various streaming services. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to set up and use. The device plugs into an HDMI port and connects to the internet via Wi-Fi. The remote has a microphone button that lets me use voice commands to search for content, control playback, and launch apps. I can also use it to control the volume and power of my TV.The Fire TV Stick supports 1080p resolution and HDR formats, which means I can enjoy high-quality video and vibrant colors. It also supports Dolby Atmos sound, which adds more depth and realism to the audio. The device has a fast processor that makes it responsive and smooth. It has access to a huge library of apps, including Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, YouTube, and more. I can also watch live TV and sports with apps like BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, and BT Sport. You can also add third-party apps (such as Kodi) if you unlock developer permissions...The Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote is a great device for anyone who wants to turn their TV into a smart TV. It is affordable, easy to use, and offers a lot of features and content. It is not as advanced as the Fire TV Stick 4K, which supports 4K resolution and more HDR formats, but it is still a very good option for 1080p TVs. I definitely recommend it!

Great product with excellent voice recognition
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 April 2024Style Name: Fire TV StickVerified Purchase
I’ve been using this for a few months now and very impressed. The UI is seamless and features every streaming service you can think of. Controlling the UI with the remote is very intuitive and navigating the settings etc is also very easy to do. Setup took about 5-10 minutes tops before everything was up and running. The most important part though, the voice control can understand Scottish people. Normally these don’t work too well with my families accent but this one works very well. Have already recommended this product to many friends.

Streaming Bliss: Amazon Fire TV Stick
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2024Style Name: Fire TV StickVerified Purchase
Right, it's time to talk about the ultimate binge-watching companion – the Amazon Fire TV Stick. As a devoted streamer, I've had my fair share of gadgets, but this one has truly upped my streaming game.Performance & Power (4/5): The latest release of the Fire TV Stick is a powerhouse when it comes to streaming. It's 50% more powerful than its predecessor, making Full HD streaming a breeze. With the Alexa Voice Remote that comes with power and volume buttons, it's a truly amazing. The only drawback is that it can get a bit sluggish at times, especially with extensive apps. Still, I'll give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars for its performance.Voice Control & Simplicity (5/5): Alexa Voice Remote - oh, how I love you! It lets me search and launch programs across various apps using just my voice. The preset buttons make it a breeze to access my favorite apps quickly. Plus, it's a real remote multitasker – it controls power and volume on my TV and soundbar, eliminating the need for multiple remotes. A perfect 5 out of 5 stars for voice control and simplicity.Audio Experience (4/5): If you're an audio aficionado, you'll appreciate the support for Dolby Atmos on selected titles. The immersive audio experience is a great feature. However, it's worth noting that you'll need compatible home audio systems to truly unlock this feature. Hence, a respectable 4 out of 5 stars for audio.Content Variety (5/5): Amazon has nailed it when it comes to content variety. From BBC iPlayer to Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video, Disney+, and more, the options are endless. Amazon Prime members get the added bonus of unlimited access to a vast library. Live TV subscriptions are available too, with channels like Eurosport and Sky News. Free TV apps like ITVX and PlutoTV are also at your fingertips. It's a solid 5 out of 5 stars for content variety.User-Friendly Setup (5/5): Setting up the Fire TV Stick is a breeze. Plug it in behind your TV, turn on the TV, and connect to the internet – that's it. It's sleek, stays hidden, and adds a ton of functionality to your TV. A well-deserved 5 out of 5 stars for user-friendliness.In conclusion, the Amazon Fire TV Stick has truly elevated my streaming experience. It's the ultimate entertainment companion, offering a plethora of content and a user-friendly interface. While it may have some occasional hiccups in performance, it's a must-have for any avid streamer.

Easy to set up. I was able to do it myself so must be easy. My Sony Smart TV began to play up and would not load the Prime or Disney Plus Apps and I was never able to watch Apple on my TV and had to put a cable from the laptop to the TV. ITVX would not work. Enter the Fire Stick and watching TV Apps is so much easier. Very pleased

A Great Start To The Generation & A Promising Future.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2020Edition: PS5 DiscVerified Purchase
**Updates at the bottom**So having owned and used the PS5 for just over a month now, I thought I'd share my initial impressions via this review.The console is big, probably the biggest I've owned, and I've had a fair few. With that said when stood vertically on the supplied stand it really doesn't take up a great deal of space alongside a TV, or on a desk besides a monitor. Even horizontally it will only take up the same space as traditional HiFi seperate unit. It just feels looks larger due to its design and colour.Within that large casing it houses a substantial cooling solution. During use the fan is exceptionally quiet and I am yet to hear it step up to levels that are audible in normal circumstances. What can clearly been heard is the optical drive. You know when the BD drive is spinning. It's a little disappointing compared to the relative serenity of the rest of the system. Thankfully its rare the drive needs to work outside of installation, or initialisation.Once the system is running you encounter the UI for the first time. Everything is fairly straightforward with games front and centre. Elements will be familiar to former PlayStation owners but equally other will be less so, and maybe a little confusing at first. Once you're used to it, it's actually better than the PS4's but there are shortcomings. One glaring omissions is the lack of folders for your games and media. I am sure this can be added in a future update but it seems odd to exclude it in the first place. Closing games can be a little convoluted. On the PS4 it was a fairly straightforward affair, but. On the PS5 it take at least one to two additional button presses.Games are what it's all about and this were the PS5 excels. So far I have played AC: Valhalla, Demon's Souls, WRC9, FIFA21, Astrobot, No Man's Sky, Bugsnax and Haven. These are all PS5 builds and a mix Triple A and Indie titles. In terms of performance it's a big step up. All of these games hit 60fps with ease. This make a big difference to action titles like AC and Demon's Souls. Couple that with the boost in visual fidelity, and lightning fast load times( thanks to the SSD) and they are joy to play. Then we have backwards compatibility. Many older games receive a significant performance boost and some first party titles receive a graphical upgrade. The now notorious Cyberpunk 2077 serves as a great example of the PS5 power. The game was poorly optimised at release for the PS4 family of consoles, to the point were it unplayable on vanilla hardware. While running the PS4 build, the PS5 can maintain a steady 60fps. Pop in is non-existent thanks to the super fast SSD and RAM, the texture pop in isn't detectable.Everything isn't rosy when it comes to games though. Storage is limited. Of the 825gb only 667gb is usable. There is an M.2 slot for future expansion, but this currently disabled due to no suitable drives being available. You can use an external to store and play PS4 games, however you won't benefit from the boosted loading times offered by the SSD. Because of the adoption of a standardised M.2 slot this will mean future expansion will be available and get cheaper over time.Probably the biggest surprise is the Dual Sense. Until you pick it up and play Astrobot you don't realise how big of game changer this could be. The haptic feedback is fantastic. The fine tuning on Astrobot allows you feel every surface and input. The adaptive trigger add depth to simple actions like drawing a bow. WRC 9 makes great use of this too by adding resistance to the brake trigger to mimic the progression of the pedal. If none of this is your thing, or you feel it will hinder how competitive you can be, it can all be disabled or tones down. Aside from the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, the Dual Sense feels great in the hand. The DS4 was a major step up from the DS3, and the Dual Sense feels almost as big a leap. It's easily my controller of choice now. My only criticism would be that on both my Dual Senses the R1 and L1 buttons are audible. It isn't the sound of a micro switch, but more the sound of plastic on plastic.So overall the PS5 is a great starting point for a promising future.**Update**So nearly two years into ownership and things have arguably got better. Many new and useful features have been added as well as some quality of life improvements. It would have been nice to see VRR and 1440p support come sooner but it's better late than never. I've added an internal m.2 NVME and have been using an external HDD for PS4 games. As of yet I've not issues with either. Overall the experience for myself remains excellent.***Update Nov 2023***So with three years of ownership under my belt have my thoughts changed? No not at all. The PS5 has been solid throughout. It's just a shame Sony haven't given us a few more exclusives in that time. I would still recommend the PS5.

Good and reliable item , easy to install
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2023Colour Name: CharcoalConfiguration: Device OnlyVerified Purchase
Having been investing in Alexa Dots for some years saw this newer version on a prime deal so added it to my collection . I normally replace an old version and find somewhere new to place the older one. My house is now pretty much covered with Alexa Dots now.As always with Alexa products this unit is easy to setup and install straight out of the box. As a veteran Alexa user I already have the app set up and used the Amazon preconfigured option selected at checkout ..If you are new to Alexa you will have to download and setup the Alexa app, which is also intuitive and easy to set up.Now to the Dot itself , it looks identical to the 4th generation dot so be a little careful when buying one and make sure you buy the generation you want . There should be better pricing and deals on the 4th Gen but the reason I purchased this one is due to some additional tech inside the unit and supposedly better sound quality.The sound is very good, not HI-FI quality but more than good enough for day to day use . ( I have paired 2 x Dots together in my main room to utilise the stereo options on the device. Apparently the 5th gen has a larger speaker/woofer and after comparing the 4th and the 5th gen together I can confirm the sound quailty is slightly better with particularly a better bass ) the difference in quality is NOT a huge jump from the gen 4 but still noticeably better , and is massively better than the 3rd gen Dot.An issue I have with both the 5th and 4th Gen Alexa Dot is the light bar is on the bottom of the unit. I use the light bar quite a lot to see if Alexa is responding in a noisy Enviroment or for notifications and as with most of my dots I buy 3rd party wall mounts for them to keep the cables nice and tidy and off a flat surface.the problem with this as most of these mounts place the light ring at the back and therefore close to the wall and makes the light bar hard to view. ( it’s a minor niggle not a deal breaker )The additional tech that grabbed my attention was the inclusion of a temperature and motion sensor.Both these would be ideal to add to my smart Home system to enable routines for heating and lighting etc so was eager to test these out.The temperature sensor:This is a great addition works very well and responds quickly to voice commands. I tested the accuracy by putting another smart temp sensor in the same room with an additional stand alone temperature sensor.The accuracy of the Alexa sensor was accurate and comparable to the two other sensors tested in the same room .. it is so easy to add it to routines in the Alexa app and works well.The Motion Sensor:I was eager to try this out as well as I wanted to make use of it Alexa routines such as if someone walked in the room the lights switched on and if there was no motion for a set time the lights would switch off. This is a fairly simple routine in the smart home .Unfortunately the motion sensor in the Alexa Dot 5th gen is pretty much useless and simply doesn’t work. It uses a slightly different way by detecting motion using ultrasonic technology. I realise this technology wouldn’t be the best as any noise in the room, such as TV , people speaking etc would diminish the accuracy of the sensor .. however having tested it many times in a completely silent room it simply doesn’t work , and on the odd occasion it does actually work it’s usually from an unknown source and not actually from someone entering the room.Conclusion: if you want good Alexa integration , a more than adequate sound for every day use , and a temp sensor buy this with no qualms that you will be getting a good quality product that works well straight from the box.If you are buying this for the motion sensor tech , don’t bother it’s useless and you would be much better off buying a separate smart motion sensor . The Echo Dot version is unreliable and just going to give you many headaches

It takes the best selling smart speaker and makes it just a little bit better
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 October 2022Colour Name: CharcoalConfiguration: Device OnlyVerified Purchase




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 Two years have passed since I reviewed the Amazon Echo Dot Gen 4 and now we have the new Echo Dot Gen 5 so it’s time to revisit the world of Alexa.If you’re familiar with Echo and Alexa, you’ll only be interested in the first part of this review and you can ignore everything after my device appraisal. I’m sure, though, that many people may be new to smart speakers so I’ve also added sections on how to install the Alexa app, how to set up your new speaker and what you can subsequently do with the Echo Dot. My apologies for going over things that you might already know and a lot of this repeats from my previous review, but there will be for which this is new territory.The Device:The Echo speakers have been around for many years now, and despite the best efforts of Google and Apple, Amazon’s Alexa still remains the smart assistant of choice. The most popular of all smart speakers is the Echo Dot. Other bigger and better sounding speakers are available including Amazon’s own larger Echo, but the Echo Dot has always hit a nice sweet spot of performance and affordability. The first couple of generations of Echo Dots were clearly toes in the water to see if we were ready for smart assistants. They gave us a glimpse of what could be achievable, but they didn’t sound particularly good. We’ve still got a couple of Generation 2 Echo Dots that live in the garage and shed, and they really do sound tinny and weak. That changed with the Generation 3 Echo Dot, of which we have seven around the house, as they sounded so much better. The sound was deeper and the volume could go much higher before losing fidelity. The microphone was also improved, and the entire experience with using Alexa made a big step forward.Two years ago I bought an Echo Dot Generation 4 on release day, and shortly afterwards followed that up with the larger Echo. And today, the Generation 5 arrived. I’ve spent several hours since then playing with it, testing it out alongside my existing speakers and the very similar Generation 4.So, what’s different between the Gen 4 and 5? Well, visually, not very much. The only real difference I could spot was the loss of an auxiliary port from the rear of the new device. Beyond that, no difference at all. I read from the press releases that the 5 is sonically much improved over the 4, but in side-by-side testing I struggled to see much difference between the two. If anything, I felt that Alexa’s voice when she’s talking to you seems like she’s stood a little further away. But it still sounds great. Not just great for the money, but great in general.We have much bigger and better speakers in our house, but when listening to music we almost always play it through the Echo Dots. I’ve got a Bose speaker right next to the Dot in my office, but always use the Dot for music. I work from home and I’m in my office 9-16 hours per day, and the Echo Dot is on for most of that time. If you want the absolute best sound, you’re likely to want to spend much more on a dedicated sound system, but for general, everyday use, the Echo Dot is brilliant. Sound remained stable even at maximum volume, and just as good I found Alexa was able to hear my commands despite cranking the volume up.Something new to the Generation 5 is the introduction of “tap to pause”. A quick tap on the dome of the Echo will pause your music. A simple addition, but so welcome. When someone rings me when I’m working a quick tap is so much better than yelling at Alexa to shut up before I can accept the call. Another tap will resume the music.I have to say, even two years down the line, I still prefer the shape of the Echo Dot Gen 3. I just preferred the puck-shape, and it sat lower to the ground so didn’t obstruct the view of the monitors on my desk. The buttons for volume, action and turning off the microphone are on top of the globe are raised characters resembling a games controller. The status light is around the base of the speaker rather than the top on Gen 3 and earlier devices.Setting up the Echo is, as usual, very simple. If you have a previous Alexa system them it connects straight to your existing network with no input at all. If it’s your first Echo device and assuming you have the Alexa app you go to Devices, Add, Amazon Echo, and wait for it to connect. The work of moments, and then it’s ready to go. Like the Gen 3 and 4 it uses its own power cable rather than a USB cable as the Gen 1 & 2 used.So, the verdict? The RRP, and reviewed price, is £54.99 which is £5 more than the outgoing Gen 4. The tap to pause feature almost makes up that £5 for me. I read in early press releases that the new Gen 5 can also be used as a Wi-fi repeater in compatible mesh systems such as the Eero range, but I didn’t see anything further mention that in the Amazon sales page and I’ve not been able to test that out. Just like the Gen 4 before it, the Gen 5 will almost certainly become the biggest selling smart speaker on the market. I’ve been more than happy with it in my early time with it and find it to be a great albeit minor evolution of the previous Dot.Once again though, the only real competition to Echo Dot is its own predecessors. The Gen 3 Echo Dot is still available at the time of writing. It’s almost as good to listen to, and I think looks nicer. It’s also quite a bit cheaper. Is the Gen 5 that much better than the Gen 3 to warrant the price premium? I’m not so sure, but I do like to keep up with the latest releases where possible.Taken in isolation, the Gen 5 Amazon Echo Dot is an excellent smart speaker. I gave the Gen 3 and Gen 4 a five-star review, and the Gen 5 gets the same accolade. It will undoubtedly go on to be the best-selling product of its type.How to set it up you Echo device:If you’re new to the world of Alexa then you may be wondering how easy it is to set up an Echo device. If you’ve ordered from Amazon, they’ll helpfully email you a guide to setting it up. You’ll need the Amazon Alexa app, available from both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Download and wait for it to install, and then open it up. The app gives help on various subjects if you tap the question mark in the top right corner of the home screen. The guide on setting up your new Echo Dot is found in this area by selecting Alexa Devices, then Echo Dot, and Set Up Your Echo Dot.As a quick overview though, plug in your Echo Dot (after a short period the status light will turn orange to show it is in Setup mode) and then open the Alexa app. On the bottom menus select “Devices”. On the Devices screen, tap the “+” button in the top right and choose “Add Device”. Select “Amazon Echo” and then “Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and more”. Assuming your Echo is plugged in and the status light is orange, select “Yes”. The app will then search for your new Echo Dot and complete the setup. The whole process takes only a few moments, and then you’re ready to get creative with Skills and Routines.What you can do with Alexa:A smart speaker is actually quite dumb to start with. It’s when you start adding things that it becomes truly smart in my view. On its own, you’ll be able to ask Alexa questions, play a few games, set up alarms and reminders and get a weather forecast; the general things you’d expect from a home assistant. Remember to always begin every command with the wake word, “Alexa…”, which can be altered to “Amazon”, “Echo” or “Computer” if you wish. To do certain things and play games you need to enable “Skills & Games”, which is found in the “More” menu at the bottom of the app. In there, you’ll find hundreds of things you can do with Alexa. For example, I regularly play the BBC quiz shows Pointless and Tenable. “Alexa, what is the weather forecast” or “Alexa, give me a ten-minute countdown” are examples of simple commands.As I say though, the Echo is just the gateway to a vast array of smart applications. How smart it goes depends on how far you want to go and how much to spend. What starts out as a single Echo device can quickly expand to a device in every room, attached to smart devices such as light bulbs, sockets, central heating and cameras. The first thing you may wish to use your speaker for is playing music. Echo is compatible with most of the main music streaming services such as Apple and Spotify, and of course Amazon Music. With your Echo you get access to Amazon Music’s free service, which is actually pretty good. It is limited, and you won’t find all of your favourite artists, but I recommend you try it out for a week or two as it might be good enough for your requirements. If not, I do highly recommend upgrading to Amazon Music Unlimited, or better still Amazon Music Unlimited Family which can be shared with multiple family members (not necessarily in the same household). I’ve not encountered many songs that aren’t on there. I used to have my iPhone full of mp3 music, but now I stream everything. “Alexa, play some 80’s rock” and I’m good for hours. If you have multiple speakers you can have the music played to one, many or all of them for house-wide coverage.Philips Hue lightbulbs are fantastic devices. They’re very expensive compared to a standard LED bulb, but once you buy one and use it in conjunction with Alexa voice control you soon become hooked. We’re up to 30 Hue bulbs now, and I don’t regret a single purchase.Smart sockets, such as Amazon’s own models or the TP-Link Kasa models, that I recommend, are great for controlling things like Christmas lights and lamps.Your central heating can be controlled by Alexa if you have a suitable smart thermostat. I can ask “Alexa, what’s the temperature in the house?”, and having determined that it’s too cold, if my wife not wrapped head to toe in fleece blankets wasn’t enough, I can then say “Alexa, set the house to 20 degrees”.Some door bells and cameras, such as Ring products, work with Alexa voice control also. “Alexa, show me the front door” and she’ll bring up live video on a suitable device like a Fire tablet or an Echo Show.Many televisions also have Alexa integration too. Our LG OLED can be controlled by its built in Alexa.A comprehensive smart home/automation is expensive, I’m not going to sugar that pill, but if it’s something that interests you then look out for these extra products on Black Friday deals would be my tip. All the devices I’ve mentioned and shown on my reviews were purchased from Amazon.I’ll leave it there though as I’ve waffled long enough. I hope you consider giving the Echo Dot a try. I’m of the opinion that the worth of a gadget is in how much you use it, and we use our Echoes and Alexa frequently every day.

            Two years have passed since I reviewed the Amazon Echo Dot Gen 4 and now we have the new Echo Dot Gen 5 so it’s time to revisit the world of Alexa.If you’re familiar with Echo and Alexa, you’ll only be interested in the first part of this review and you can ignore everything after my device appraisal. I’m sure, though, that many people may be new to smart speakers so I’ve also added sections on how to install the Alexa app, how to set up your new speaker and what you can subsequently do with the Echo Dot. My apologies for going over things that you might already know and a lot of this repeats from my previous review, but there will be for which this is new territory.The Device:The Echo speakers have been around for many years now, and despite the best efforts of Google and Apple, Amazon’s Alexa still remains the smart assistant of choice. The most popular of all smart speakers is the Echo Dot. Other bigger and better sounding speakers are available including Amazon’s own larger Echo, but the Echo Dot has always hit a nice sweet spot of performance and affordability. The first couple of generations of Echo Dots were clearly toes in the water to see if we were ready for smart assistants. They gave us a glimpse of what could be achievable, but they didn’t sound particularly good. We’ve still got a couple of Generation 2 Echo Dots that live in the garage and shed, and they really do sound tinny and weak. That changed with the Generation 3 Echo Dot, of which we have seven around the house, as they sounded so much better. The sound was deeper and the volume could go much higher before losing fidelity. The microphone was also improved, and the entire experience with using Alexa made a big step forward.Two years ago I bought an Echo Dot Generation 4 on release day, and shortly afterwards followed that up with the larger Echo. And today, the Generation 5 arrived. I’ve spent several hours since then playing with it, testing it out alongside my existing speakers and the very similar Generation 4.So, what’s different between the Gen 4 and 5? Well, visually, not very much. The only real difference I could spot was the loss of an auxiliary port from the rear of the new device. Beyond that, no difference at all.

I jumped up from the Echo 1 to the Dot 5 and I have to say I am very impressed. The sound quality is outstanding (Sorry to the neighbors for testing max volume). As with any Echo the setup is easy, you barely have to do anything to get it going. I picked mine up on the Spring sale and it was just a fantastic deal.The build quality is excellent and the voice recognition/responses are the best out there for voice assistants.

This tiny powerhouse surprises with its impressive sound and features. Alexa covers everything from alarms to tunes, and the audio quality surpasses expectations for its size.Favorites:Rocking Sound: Despite its size, the Dot pumps out rich, full sound that fills my room.Alexa, My Helper: Whether for weather updates or fun facts, Alexa's always ready.Tap and Go: New tap gestures are handy for quick adjustments.Stylish and Eco-friendly: sleek on my nightstand and made with recycled materials.Considerations:Not Audiophile-Grade: Fantastic for everyday listening.Amazon Account Required: You'll need one for Alexa's full potential.Deezer Integration: Occasionally finicky.Overall, the Echo Dot (5th gen) is a steal for its price. I highly recommend it for a versatile and fun smart speaker!Bonus Tip: Pair two dots for stereo sound. Boom!P.S. Watch for Amazon deals, discounts on Echo devices are common. I hope this helps you decide!

Excellent RPG and Fantasy Game
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 February 2021Platform For Display: PlayStation 4Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
Set in the fantasy world of Skyrim, you enter the game as a prisoner, and at this point can select from about a dozen races (each that gives you a slight edge), your gender, and you can tweak your appearance.  From here on in, you enter a massive world that you can explore at will.  You don't have a set class as in dungeons and dragons, but if you wanted to specialise in magic or warrior-craft or thievery, you have plenty of scope to do so.  The game mechanics are insanely easy to learn and very user friendly. As you increase your skills, you gain levels that grant you more abilities.  With skills, as in life, the more fireballs you throw at baddies, the more quickly your skill grows!  There are loads and loads of quests to do that will take you off across the world, and you also have moral choices to make. If you don't want to be doing quests, you can explore this immense world - the quality of the graphics is mindblowing!  I've been playing for weeks and it feels like I've barely scratched the surface it is so deep and there is so much you can do.  You can also craft weapons and armour, enchant items, you can build manor houses, adopt children to live in them, and influence and shape the world you live in by your deeds, especially as you are the Dragonborn.  As I said, I have playing for weeks and I reckon there is months more I will be playing this game so it is fantastic value for money.  If you enjoy RPG/Fantasy games, then this is well worth a look!  I can't recommend this game highly enough!

Epic Open World
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 October 2016Platform For Display: PlayStation 4Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
Lovely intro with the dragon attack and escaping. Dual casting high elf mage is good fun and magic feels great. Easy to setup favourites and change in combat. Shame the inventory space is so limited as you have to dump weightier items. I hope you can increase this later in the game like The Witcher 3 and saddlebags. Like Fallout 4 items occasionally stick to you when you try to pick them up, a small bug. Graphics are very good with a long draw distance. Incidental detail is excellent like the fireflies you can take out of the air.The world map is excellent and detailed, fast traveling between places you have already been to. The map is packed full of places to explore like dungeons, bandit hideouts, etc. Upgrade system is beautiful with skill trees woven into the constellations. Levelling is handled  for actions like lock picking, battles, creating new potions, etc. Tons of side quests when you talk to people in towns with good choice decisions, do you give the letter to the intended recipient or instead betray them to another party?The mods require a Bethesda account to be setup and the pre order DLC is for The Elder Scrolls Online. Like Fallout 4 this is another huge open world to explore and that is the fun of it, forget the main plot, walk into the wilderness and explore to your hearts content. There is a huge amount of customisation to your character like nose type, etc and a ton of weapons, armour and so on to pick up. Playing as a mage forces you to focus on magic which meant I had to sell my heavy armour for a magical robe with 50% magic regen, and lose that armour bonus. Staying still you regenerate HP.Fantastic RPG with a massive open world to get absorbed into, graphically very good, facial models not up to The Witcher 3, very high production values. Should last me until Dishonoured 2 comes out :-)

Quicker load times are a big deal.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2016Platform For Display: PlayStation 4Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
Qualifier - I have only played for about 20 hours so far, and will update my comments if I suddenly run into a shed load of bugs.  Bearing this in mind....I was an avid player of the original PS3 version, never having finished the main quest because I (inevitably) got distracted by the huge number of interesting sub quests, but really enjoying it as a uniquely compelling game. I absolutely concur with some of the more negative reviewers in terms of the bug-infested nature of Bethesda games, although I have only really found this annoying (rather than just mildly amusing) when it breaks a quest. That has happened a handful of times at most to me, and there has always been either a patch or a work-around. You also have to give them some respect for having delivered some of the best ever first person rpgs in the form of Skyrim and Fallout 3/4. Some of the frothier reviews seem to suggest they are the devil incarnate, having ruined the lives of ickle-pritty gamers with their bug-laden product. If you really gouge your eyes out whenever they're assaulted by a levitating mammoth....we'll, you need to get out more.  Having said all of this, I have yet to come across any of the latter ""game breaking"" bugs in the PS4 version, and must say I am glad I bought it for one particular reason - load times. Yes the graphics are a bit better, and yes the visual depth is a bit better, and yes we now have ""god rays"" blah blah, but none of this represents a really massive improvement to gameplay imho. The load times though, are massively improved - i.e. not having to wait 60 seconds because you have had the temerity to open a door, or even longer whenever you fast travel. Joy unbounded. Making a cup of tea every ten minutes was taking its toll on my bladder.I agree with other reviewers that only really committed fans (to which I confess) should buy this as an upgraded version of something you already own, but that if you haven't played it before it is highly recommended.

I walked 5 miles while at work! Wish I'd got one sooner.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2023Colour Name: GreyVerified Purchase
I love this thing! I've been thinking about getting one for ages, I was tempted to go for a cheaper model that didn't fold but when my husband got on board he said to go for a better one. It was easy to set up on the app, the tutorial was very good.It was very heavy to get up the stairs on my own but because it folders it's easier to get your arms around. Now it's upstairs, it moves easily by just tilting the back and using the wheels at the front.I have carpet upstairs and while I've seen people do put it on carpet, I put two lengths of leftover laminate flooring down and put it on top of that.

            I love this thing! I've been thinking about getting one for ages, I was tempted to go for a cheaper model that didn't fold but when my husband got on board he said to go for a better one. It was easy to set up on the app, the tutorial was very good.It was very heavy to get up the stairs on my own but because it folders it's easier to get your arms around. Now it's upstairs, it moves easily by just tilting the back and using the wheels at the front.I have carpet upstairs and while I've seen people do put it on carpet, I put two lengths of leftover laminate flooring down and put it on top of that.

Easy to store (goes right under the sofa in my office). Easy to use/understand. Really, really convenient and an excellent addition to my work life. But be warned, it is hefty!The only thing I’d say is the remote is a bit limiting. Because there is no display on the actual unit, the remote is the only way you can see the data like step count, distance etc but all of these numbers flash past in a loop and there is no button to change what data you want to focus on. You just have to wait until the number you want to see comes round again in the loop.

Folding aspect the best bit
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2024Colour Name: GreyVerified Purchase
Love the fact that I can fold this treadmill in half to store under the lounge table. It makes it so much easier to set up and although very heavy (a handle or strap to help drag it out from under said table would help), it is a great piece of kit. I love the app and remote control which monitors your progress. Well worth the extra money.

Good addition to your daily exercise routine!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2024Colour Name: GreyVerified Purchase
Ideal addition for those that like to keep active regardless of the weather outside!I was a little apprehensive about purchasing a walking pad as previously I had a treadmill with the usual attached support. However, I have quickly got used to it despite not the greatest personal sense of balance. You could add a support or stand up desk if this was an issue. These items are purchasable.I like the design being easily foldable and it can be stored under a desk or against a wall. Whilst it has wheels on one side it is heavy so you don’t really want to be storing it too far from your exercise area in the house. The app and remote are very easy to use.All in all a good addition to your personal exercise routine. Recommended.

Really useful and sturdy piece of equipment. Love it.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 August 2021Colour Name: GreyVerified Purchase
I bought this walking pad so that I can do some calorie burning whilst watching Netflix. It arrived well-packed with power cable, remote control with lanyard, wrench, silicon oil and instructions.The remote is quite easy to use. It displays time, speed, distance, calories and steps.There are two modes: manual & automatic. In manual mode, you need to use the plus and minus buttons to adjust the speed. In automatic mode, it will accelerate if you are walking at the top of the belt and slow down if you are walking at the bottom of the belt. I haven’t tried the automatic mode yet.Moving the pad is quite easy due to the wheels at the side of the motor, as long as you unplug the power cable. The socket is located at the front of the pad, so leaving the power cable in it means you really need to bend your back quite a lot to wheel the pad.It is probably not very safe to move the unpacked pad via stairs by one person, as it’s too loose and bulky (unless maybe after securing it with a luggage strap).It is important to place the pad in a straight line to the TV or desk, as otherwise you will be stepping on the sides and losing your balance. I did.During the first few uses, I could smell some burning type of smell, but this goes away pretty quickly.The instructions are written by a person who is not a native English speaker and comprehensible for the most part, but sometimes need to think a what they mean. Fortunately, there is a lot of images that help to figure it out.I am not sure why the weight limit is set to 100 kg, as the pad is very sturdy and can accommodate much heavier people. I’m guessing either the motor is wearing out quicker or the pad might not be wide enough for the heavier people.Silicone oil needs to be applied every 3 months.The app that goes with the pad has poor reviews, but it is not necessary to install it for it to work, so I didn’t bother.Overall, it is an excellent piece of equipment and even with the minor shortcomings it deserves 4.9 stars.

Great game and although takes a 'chunk' of time,  you don't need to give over a whole afternoon (eg monopoly)It's relatively straightforward,  and once you're up and running doesn't take long to set up; but instructions could be clearer.It's worth reading the end before the beginning - and could probably be cut in half.

Ticket to Ride is a must-play. There is very little downtime between actions, as each player can only do one thing and actions resolve quickly.The rules are very simple for anyone to understand, but the objective/goal cards give the whole game a greater depth, replay-ability and purpose beyond just simply connecting random cities together. Even the most hardcore game enthusiasts among us got really into the game and enjoyed it.If you're looking for a great board game for a reasonable price, with lots of replay-ability, this is a great game to start with. Just be warned, you need quite a good sized table to play.

As an avid skincare enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for products that deliver exceptional results, and  La Neige Lip Sleeping Mask has truly exceeded my expectations. It has become an indispensable part of my nighttime routine.The La Neige Lip Sleeping Mask has a rich, creamy consistency that glides effortlessly onto the lips. Unlike some lip balms that feel waxy or heavy, this mask feels incredibly luxurious and lightweight, providing instant relief to dry or chapped lips.One of the standout features of this lip mask is its effectiveness in hydrating and nourishing the lips. It works wonders in replenishing lost moisture and restoring softness to even the most parched lips. I've noticed a significant improvement in the texture of my lips since incorporating this mask into my nightly routine – they feel smoother, plumper, and more supple than before.Another aspect that sets the La Neige Lip Sleeping Mask apart is its delightful scent and flavor. Unlike some lip products that can have an overpowering or artificial fragrance, this mask boasts a subtle, sweet scent that is both refreshing and soothing.Simply apply a generous layer before bedtime, and let the mask work its magic while you sleep. By morning, you'll wake up to lips that are visibly softer, smoother, and more hydrated.I also appreciate the thoughtful packaging of the La Neige Lip Sleeping Mask. The sleek, compact jar is perfect for travel or tossing into your handbag, ensuring that you can keep your lips moisturized and pampered wherever you go.

I’ve experienced great results even without the exfoliating steps and I’m always pleasantly surprised! I don’t use it everyday but I’m sure if I did, my lips would stay soft. Also comes with a cute little application brush with a tiny travel pouch. Highly recommend.

Really Is Rather Good and Worth Paying the Money For
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 August 2019Colour Name: BlackStyle Name: Action CameraVerified Purchase
I am a total novice with action cameras so I waited a while to review this so I could give a fair and informative review for a novice.I chose GoPro after going through a multitude of reviews for just about every camera and every price range I could find.  I surprised myself by going for one of the most expensive on the market rather than a cheap one.  So, what influenced my decision?Gopro continuously came up as about the best product on the market with the Hero7 black as the bees knees, and the silver and white falling into second and third place.  I could not find a single good review, except on amazon, for cheaper copies. Although I am not in a position to criticise them.Review of the various GoPro versions on You Tube showed the performance of the black to be outstanding with additional benefits of good audio, has multiple microphones and is not impeded by the need for a waterproof case. It is waterproof to around 20-30 meters without a case and there is a further case available if you need to go to 40 meters.  There is a wide array of photo and video settings, voice control, blue tooth, internet, remote phone connection at 2.5 and 5.0 “whatevers” for the mobile phone app.  The features go on and on and what’s more they can be viewed working on the internet so in the end I trusted these features work, and they do.There were a few negatives and I have cured most of these.I discovered it eats power, like a bitch.  Initially this caused me a lot of annoyance but I have discovered that the cure is simple.  It’s certain features that kill your power so if you are not using them turn them off.  Then the power consumption turns from useless to excellent.  Features that need to be turned off if you are not using them:1) Connection to app2) Connection to internet3) GPS4) Voice Control5) Blue tooth6) Screen brightness – it is very bright so it only needs to be at about 20% and that is still brightI don’t find not using the app a problem as the touch screen is fully readable even if you wear a + 4.5 prescription lens (as long as you are wearing them).  This surprised me as I normally have to go for a big screen option. The app is great when you are getting to know your device and getting used to the touch screen controls but, it can be a bit glitchy.  Give the touch controls a chance. They are annoying at first but you soon get used to themExtra tips I would give are:1) Buy an extra battery or two and a charger, non-branded ones still work well.2) Only use voice controls if you need them or, all you hear in the recording is you shouting at your GoPro (probably no need to shout).  In addition, when using the voice control the device reverts to stand-by for 6 hours following the command to turn off.  During which it has a nasty habit of turning itself on spontaneously.  I have had a 25-minute recording of the inside of the camera case with the voices of people around it and lost a good deal of battery power.3) Read the manual available online.  I found it very helpful indeed, and it is not too techy to put a novice off.4) Make sure the memory card you buy is suitable for 4K recording, it needs to be high speed.  Check the specs online before purchasing.  I bought a 128gb high speed card, and you honestly do not need one with quite that much space but, it was not much more expensive than one with 64gb.  Note:  I have not bothered with the 4K yet as I do not currently have a 4K monitor.There is the option to buy the GoPro Plus which gives you unlimited cloud storage, extra support function, half price accessories and a new GoPro should you manage to break it.  This to me suggested it was very difficult to break.  I purchased it but, did note that you can only upload short clips i.e. less than 5 minutes.  Disappointing but, not enough to make me cancel my subscription.  The failed order I put through may.  But, let’s see how they resolve it.  Note: your first 30 days is free and the account does give you easy access to support information, downloadable content and various other bits and bobs that are very useful for a newbe.Overall it was money well spent.  It’s a smart trustworthy piece of kit.  The features work well once you get used to them.  I even managed to take time lapse recording of night landing from the interior of a plane.  Not brilliant but, it was my first attempt and there were results.  I keep finding new stuff it does – which is amazing.I have given it 5 stars because 4 does not do it justice.  It’s about a 4.6 with the loss coming from it little niggles when getting used to it and the power consumption before I worked out the cure.In terms of the EIS, I originally uploaded a sample but, I have removed it because the uploaded version just did not do it justice.

GoPro Hero 7 Black is a great little action camera.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 July 2020Colour Name: BlackStyle Name: Action CameraVerified Purchase
Had a GoPro Hero 5 Black for a few years, and loved it. Unfortunately it stopped working recently, first the beeps stopped then a few weeks later the screen went blank. I had considered getting the Hero 8 but I have four batteries that won't work in that model and don't see the point in upgrading those as well.So my new GoPro Hero 7 Black arrived yesterday and so far I'm impressed, the image stabilisation is very impressive with or without my Freevision gambal. Slow motion is great. Timewarp is brilliant. Not tried it at night yet nor underwater. I'm a little apprehensive about putting it underwater as there appears to be a slight gap when you close the battery door where the hinge is. I've noticed this on other Hero 7's in YouTube video's so I'm assuming it's normal, maybe someone can let me know?. One thing I wish it had is a feature on my Hero 5 where it would film a video and take intermittent pictures at the same time, use to get some amazing shots of my son playing in the sea in Pembrokeshire on holiday. Maybe if I shout 'GoPro take photo' it'll hear me above the waves, if this one does that?

I have to update this review because things have changed for the better.After going through various forums regarding gopro hero7 black issues (and the forums are full of them) time after time the compatibility of memory card was the first recommendation to check.And so I did just that.I was using a Samsung 64 Evo+ etc. memory card but the recommended memory card was Samsung Evo plus etc memory card.And now after using the appropriate memory card the camera seems to be working so much better.No overheating.No freezing.No swiping issues.No manually turning it on/off issues.And the battery life is as expected now.I fully charged it yesterday, within seconds it showed a drop to 98% (which alarmed me) but then it stabilised and after turning it off I kept returning at various points to turn it on and check the battery status and it had hardly moved at all (so unlike previous issue).I have just turned it on now (6am) and I still have 96% so I am now contacting Amazon Customer Services to cancel my return for a full refund.My daughter has handled it and she wants it now it works like it should.So that is good enough for me.Hopefully there will be no need for a further update.I hereby apologise for my error that caused this gopro hero7 black to get such a bad review.It would be good for a clearer heads up regarding the compatibility memory cards being vital when selecting this camera.The voice commands is still hit and miss but I expect that is due to accent and various other conditions.I have altered my rating score from the 1 star that I had previously gave it to a 4.75 (though no way of showing that score in the star graph).And I have left my previous review as it was in case anybody else out there has the same issues and had done what I had done.Hopefully my experience will either help someone to avoid the issues or to remedy their issues.PeaceI bought this gopro hero7 black for my daughter for her upcoming holiday.I was very excited for her after all of the praise that gopro get.But as soon as I had charged it and set it up I gave it a dummy run and I found several issues.It was soon very hot to the touch, the on/off action was very inconsistent, I couldn't  get to swipe the screen to flip through the 3 modes, the picture kept freezing and the battery died within an hour !There are more little niggles but compared to these major ones they didn't really need to be given.For all of that money and the reputation they have I am so disappointed in this product.I am just glad that I found out before my daughter had taken it on holiday because that would have been a major disaster for her.A full refund is required and I will now have to scour for a decent alternative camera.

I had a problem with it at first, it seemed to lock up and not respond. Turned out to be the card, gave it a full format in a PC (not a quick format) and all's been well since. Stunning images, I use it for cycle trips. The stabilisation is unbelievable. The sound  is OK, suffers a lot from wind noise but the image is stunning in HD, never tried the 4K because I want the stabilisation. Shoot at 50 FPS and the motion is just so smooth.OK battery life, you get a little over an hour. You do need a few for a long ride though, I have three. Changing the battery is a bit of a pain as you have to take it out of the mount,

A welcome return to form.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 July 2023Edition: Standard EditionVerified Purchase
I first began my history with the Final Fantasy series in 1991 with Final Fantasy IV (or II as it was known in the west). In the 32 years since I've watch the series grow and change in ways I never expected, but sadly, I've seen this series fall apart over the last twenty years or so. XII's characters felt dull, XIII felt restrictive, I enjoyed A Realm Reborn, Shadowbringers and Endwalker but found the rest of XIV's story to be incredibly bland, and XV always left me wondering what could have been. XVI was the series last chance for me, and I had low expectations going into it. After completing the game three times I can say that thankfully, I was wrong.On the M rating - The GoT comparisons that plagued the games advertising are thankfully limited to the aesthetic alone. Yes, there are myriad uses of ""F bombs"" scattered throughout the game, however it's not really used any more than the average person tends to use it in day-to-day life and generally only used in appropriate situations. The bad language thankfully never goes beyond that. In terms of nudity and sex scenes, there is no full frontal nudity in the game and no sexual acts are performed on screen at any time. In terms of violence, there's a fair bit but again it's no GoT. I remember games from the PS2 era that were as violent as this and they were T rated.On combat - The Devil May Cry comparisons are again unfounded. I've been playing the Devil May Cry series since its first outing on the ps2, and I can say beyond any doubt that the similarities between the two begin and end with spell animations and effects. You perform regular physical and magical attacks that deal minimal damage the the enemies health (with the exception of mobs) and then use your bigger attacks to deal more significant damage. These bigger attacks are all on timers to ensure that they can't be spammed. If anything, the combat is more similar to FFVII: Remakes without Tactical Mode; the only real difference is that basic attacks don't generate ATB. The stagger mechanic is back, and one of the more tactical elements of the game revolves around learning the difference between which attacks are more effective at generating stagger, which are best at dealing out raw damage, and utilizing those attacks in a way that gets the most out of them. The only downside is that you can't take direct control of your party members. However, the fact that most of them make use of unique spells and ability animations that no other characters in the game has makes me think that this will change in the the near future. I also have to acknowledge that once you have a good grasp on what all your skills do and how to use them effectively, the game does feel very easy. The games harder difficulty - dubbed 'Final Fantasy' mode - does offer a heightened challenge. Enemy levels scale to yours, regular enemy packs are remixed in such a way that you'll find tougher enemies in earlier places and bosses will deal more damage, but the fact that this mode is exclusive to new games ended up leaving me wanting more, purely owing to the fact that some of your late game skills trivialize everything. Personally, I'd like to see a version of this difficulty in which you can't carry over your Eikons, and boss mechanics are changed or mixed together like in FFVII: Remake. There is a lot of depth to the combat owing to the fact that every Eikon you use drastically alters your style of play, however, I personally would have preferred a party system.Boss battles - The best I have ever seen in a video game. In the latter half of the game most bosses feature four phases. This can seem like a lot, but each phase should roughly only take five minutes for first timers and less for more competent players. These Eikon fights feature all the spectacle and more of XV's summon fights, but with much more involved gameplay.Narrative - The games main story shows me that SE learned a massive lesson from XV. The narrative is incredibly well fleshed out and leaves very little to the imagination. The only exception to this is one small thing that is mentioned in the later stages of the game but is never explored. Personally, I think this has been intentionally left out so that SE can create DLC if fans want it. Luckily, it has no major impact on the games story and does not leave it feeling incomplete by any means; for example, it's not like Gladio saying ""Got some business of my own to deal with..."" Otherwise, this is a classic Final Fantasy story that includes not only high fantasy but some fantastic science fictions elements as well. There are some more sensitive topics touched upon in the narrative such as the topic of slavery, however this is done in an exceptionally respectful way; never glorifying or trivialising the issue. There are some who do seem to have a problem is this, however it is mostly rooted in bigotry because apparently people of a certain skin colour cannot be depicted in certain situations. Overall, this is a much more mature narrative that we're used to, but it still manages to retain many classic Final Fantasy elements and JRPG tropes.Characters - The game features a cast of five main characters who will act as your main party; Clive, Jill, Cid, Torgal, and one other whose name I'll leave out to avoid spoilers. When I first saw these characters and heard that the protagonist was named 'Clive' I felt incredibly disappointed as I felt as though this was going to be XII's cast all over again. Instead, I spent 40 hours with probably the best FF cast of all time. As a primary protagonist, Clive is exceptional. Some of the more weeby fans in the FF community will be (understandibly) upset by the lack of spikey hair and giant sword, but instead we get a character who is incredibly well grounded and relatable. The emotions Clive shows along his journey and the way he develops as a character over the course of twenty-plus years is something that any well adjusted adult would be able to relate to, and this is accentuated by one of the finest voiceover performances I have ever heard. Jill is much the same as Clive, and the on screen chemistry is magical between them. They leave you feelings as though both of them are the main character of this story rather than just Clive, which is such a welcome change when you look at how female characters have been in every instalment since X; Yuna was a ditz (albeit a loveable one) Ashe was one dimensional and dull, Lightning was one dimensional and dull, Y'shtola was one dimensional and dull, Lunafreya was....you see the pattern here? The only character I can really compare Jill to in terms of depth is General Celes from VI. Both characters share their doubts, hopes and dreams with each other and neither Jill nor Clive would have gotten very far without each other. This is much more of a realistic relationship between characters, and a welcome change from anime characters uhmming and ahhing their way through every conversation like Tidus and Yuna (even though I loved those characters). And now we come to Cid, who feels like a strange cross between Balthier and Auron. There's not much that I can say other than this version of Cid is quite easily the best we have seen. Loveable, cocky and well written, Cid feels like an incredibly real character, and again this is only amplified by some fantastic voice work and exceptionally well written dialogue. And of course, there's Torgal; yes, you can pet him. All of these characters are back up by an utterly superb supporting cast. Every character has depth, a backstory and their own arc. I was be very surprised if any future instalment in the series manages to create characters like this again. Finally, there's the games primary antagonist. I would not consider him the series greatest villain, but I'm so pleased to see that he does not come across as a Saturday morning cartoon villain like Exdeath or Kefka, and nor is he carries by a sob story like Emet-Selch or Ardyn. He invokes a genuine sense of fear whenever he is on screen and his enigmatic nature leaves you guessing about the true nature of his plot right up until the last second.Area design - The field zones are beautifully designed and a sight to behold. However, they are held back by lack of things such as optional dungeons and super bosses. In terms of size they're quite large, but this is rendered moot by the fact that the game has auto sprint and it cannot be turned off, so you can't really take your time to enjoy the areas. However, the lack of mini-map does push you into exploring the zones on your own initiative; something that I find very welcome.Performance - My personal preference is 60FPS during gameplay and 30FPS during cutscenes. The game does aim for this but sadly falls a little short of the mark. There are one or two cutscenes that run a little shy of 30, however given what is happening in those scenes it's difficult to be too critical of it. During combat that game runs at a consistent 60, even during the Eikon battles, however the frames can drop a lot during exploration in the field zones and in towns. During the games ""stages"" it runs consistently well. In terms of bugs/glitches, I've not encountered a single one in any of my playthroughs. I've heard that there is an issue in which PS5's are over heating during certain boss battles, however as I'm playing on performance mode I've not seen this issue at any point; in fact, I've not even heard my PS5's fan while playing the game.Music - Varied, memorable and emotive. 10/10.On the ethnic diversity controversy - During the media interviews for XVI, Naoki Yoshida stated ""There will be some diversity, but it won't be as diverse as say, for example, modern day Earth"". Certain ""journalistic"" outposts decided to run with this and claimed that there would be no ethnic minorities represented in the game and some are continuing push this to this day. I cannot stress enough that this is a blatant lie from these outlets. Without any spoilers, around the halfway point of the game you will visit a nation in which around 75% of it's population are of an ethnic minority. This is not just limited to skin colour, but also facial features and cultural dress. There have also been claims of the game mistreating its female cast and not allowing them to be powerful. Over the course of your journey, you will help out the leaders of 4 towns. These people are considered to be the towns ""most wealthy and influential individuals"". Two of them are female, and one of them is of an ethnic minority. There is also a LOT more, but I cannot go into this without giving major story spoilers, so I will just say that there is plenty of diversity in this game and it is done in a way that is not condescending, preachy, or woke.General negatives - The crafting system feels pointless. You can pick up a new weapon and one cutscene later a better one will be available and the game automatically gives you everything you need in order to create the weapons. The only time you really need to work for it is for the games endgame weapons. The side quests offer barely anything in the way of variation and are thrown at you in such abundance that they can really hinder the pacing of the story. They do offer some really good lore and do give a lot of NPC's some fantastic depth, but they mostly feel like a hindrance. The only ones I'd recommend are any that have a plus symbol marker as they provide helpful rewards, and three endgame quests entitled 'Where There's a Will', More Than Words' and 'Priceless'.Lastly, is this a 'Final Fantasy'? - It depends on what you value in a Final Fantasy title. Upon release many claimed that VII wasn't a true FF as it ditched the fantasy aspects, that VIII wasn't one as it was just a ""glorified teen romance novel"", that IX wasn't one a it was ""too cartoony and childish"", that X wasn't one is it ditched the traditional levelling system, that XI wasn't one as it was an MMO, that XII wasn't one as it ditched random encounters, that XIII wasn't one as it was just a hallway, that XIV wasn't one because it was another MMO, that XV wasn't one because you had a car and it was an action game, and now that XVI isn't one because it's also an action game and you can't control your party members. Ultimately it depends on what you value; for me, that's a world and narrative that mixes fantasy and science fiction and provides meaningful and emotive interactions between characters in a way that makes you feel as though the unique world your experiencing is actually real. Is it Final Fantasy? To me, 100%.Last piece of advice for anyone thinking of picking up the game - Ignore the reviews (including mine if you so choose). The 10/10 reviews generally come from a place of people already deciding that the game was great before it was even out purely because of the team making it, and the more negative reviews tend to come from a place of people already deciding that the game was bad before it was even out mostly because of 'ists' and 'isms', none of which were true. (There's a reason that most negative reviews come across as incredibly pretentious and condescending) The objective truth lies somewhere in the middle - that it is a flawed but ultimately fantastic game worthy of the Final Fantasy title. Not quite on the level of IX or VI, but leagues beyond the likes of VII, XII or even X. If you think this game might be for you, give it a shot and form your own opinion. If it doesn't look like if's for you, then that's a shame, but give it a miss. If you've already decided that you don't WANT it to be for you in classic FF fan fashion, then what are you even doing here?Final score - 8.5/10.

You can tell I LOVE FINAL FANTASY Games. but this was different I've spent around 45 hours on this game and I wish they made this game 100 hours long because there are parts of the game you want to understand more and get into the details!would I recommend this game?

Well made, quality game but not a masterpiece
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2023Edition: Standard EditionVerified Purchase
This is only my second Final Fantasy game so I have no special attachment to the franchise or game mechanics.It didn't take long to notice the quality of this game, graphically, story and gameplay but what surprised me the most was the music, it was a stand out success for me.The game is heavy on the cutscenes which may not be for everyone.This game has both a fidelity and performance mode, the picture quality in both were excellent and in performance mode, the frame rate was smooth for 99% of the game.The game is live action rather than turn based which is a change for the franchise, Final Fantasy 7 remake seemed to have tested the waters here before, by having real time with turn based still present but this entry is live action all the way, personally I was happy with it but long term fans may not be.No spoilers will be present for the story, I will say though that I had times when I was keen to continue to see what happens next. Unfortunately the main quests, what I would consider story is sometimes paused for what feel like side quests / busy work in the main campaign, which I would have preferred to be kept seperate. The game has side quests, so not sure what the idea was behind this, other than to slow down the story or extend the game length.This game includes what I would call accessibility options, rings which will automatically dodge attacks for you or use healing items when needed, I think these are great additions and allow people more choice in how you play whilst also giving others the chance to enjoy the game if they are less skilled.The progression is farely regular so not too long for new abilities to try and keep the game fresh also the better abilities do come later in the game.The main story can be completed in just over 30 hours, then side quests and new game plus is available for those that want to spend more time in this world.Finally bugs, I didn't encounter any bugs, no crashes, no performance issues or other concerns. This was a well polished and finished game, I wish all games were released in this state.A final verdict would be 4.5 out 5 for me.

Recent final fantasy games featured a modern/steampunk vibe, FFXVI is instead set in a fully fantasy evironment.

This ipad 10.2 gen 9 is really good value for money. I did have to wait about 1 month for delivery but I was well informed of this beforehand.. The screen / picture has that nice apple quality that other tablets struggle to compete with.the UI is flawless. No sticking or glitches it runs very Smooth. Like Silk.. The storage is just about adequit providing your not using this for all of your media storage needs.the battery life is the best yet. But will soon dip if your using it heavily or running power intensive apps. I'm using it mainly as my media remote control for my music player app with the EQ & artwork display via my macbook pro, through my Hi End Dac. The results are phenomenal. I actually would of been happy paying the asking price just to use for my music player remote and other similar uses. Like browsing files to select tracks, albums, genres artwork EQ settings etc.. 😁😜P. S . I have ordered the pencil but have not used as of yet so i will not comment. But there are lots of good reviews about this and all of its features. From what I gather a lot of people feel the same about this Drawing & Artwork  feature as I  do about the media & music player uses. . I mean if you're happy enough with paying the asking price for this 1 feature then by the time you ad up all the other stuff  this 9th generation ipad Pretty much knocks it out of the park..Now  Is the pro Bigger & better? Yes of course! Do you need all the bell's & whistles? You may well do , personally  I do not.  But I'm very happy with what my £320 buys me in this neat little package here.. Okay that About does it for now. There are plenty of other reviews with all the nitty gritty. I have the case / keyboard / pencil On Order . So I'll give my opinion on those later. 👋🏻😊 For now I  Honestly give 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. Hopefully my review can help someone pondering wether or not this is the one for them.

The 2021 iPad 10.2-inch is a great choice for those looking for a powerful and portable tablet. With 64GB of storage, it's perfect for storing all your favorite apps, music, and photos. This iPad is powered by the A12 Bionic chip, making it fast and responsive, and it runs on the latest version of iPadOS, which offers a smooth and user-friendly experience.One of the notable features of this iPad is its 10.2-inch Retina display. The display is sharp and clear, making it great for watching videos, browsing the web, or playing games. However, it does have a 60Hz refresh rate, which is not as fast as some other iPads with 120Hz refresh rates. This means that the display may not be as smooth as some users would like, especially for fast-paced games or videos.The 2021 iPad also offers great battery life, allowing you to use it for up to 10 hours on a single charge. This makes it perfect for long trips or days when you need to be productive on the go. In addition, the iPad is slim and lightweight, making it easy to carry around with you wherever you go.The tablet also supports the Apple Pencil, which is sold separately.

The Last Finger ID Home Button Model
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2024Colour Name: Space GreySize Name: 256 GBStyle Name: WiFi + CellularVerified Purchase
It is personal preference though, Face ID has been difficult to use for me when I wear sunglasses, face coverings, eye protector or in the dark place, I’d prefer the classic finger ID, so I was looking for the last finger ID home button model iPad to upgrade from my previous iPad Pro to use the same Apple Pencil, a mobile data SIM card and same lighting charging cables. This one was perfect and so easy to use for the long term Apple fan! I have seen that Apple Store still have this at £699 in January 2024 when I bought at Amazon on £649 which was a bargain. Thank you!

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2023Number Of Items: 1Verified Purchase
I am 25 and I have never watched the movies or read any of the books, but I am enjoying this game a lot. I feel like it should not be rated 12, it should be rated 17, because it is kind of similar to assassins creed. You can literally kill people in horrible ways, the only thing is that there is no blood and the bodies just disappear afterwards.I know kids these days are familiar with that stuff, and I personally wouldn’t mind my 12 year old kid playing this, but still…Anyways, I love this game to bits.

Great game and follows a prequel storyline even before Dumbledore’s time at Hogwarts. Gameplay follows a linear trail to begin with but this is necessary to get you onto the gameplay itself. Graphics quality and character movement are both excellent as is the sound quality. Play this on the biggest screen you can for a real gaming experience.

Delivery was great, its a great phone at a brilliant price. This phone won't disappoint you.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 November 2018Style Name: UK VersionColour: Midnight BlackConfiguration: Single SimVerified Purchase
Firstly. Delivery was great, came a lot earlier than I expected. And it's the real deal, no fake.My reviewBattery life: 6/10-battery is actually probably the worst feature of this phone, by no means is it bad, but its not great. The fast charging makes up for it though.Display: 10/10-very bright, colours pop, clear images. This phone is great to watch videos and play games on. Almost everyone I hang out with or am around will always mention how nice my display is.Hardware: 8/10-it really feels like a premium and expensive device. It has a headphone jack, AMAZING speakers, USB type C, expandable storage, finger print sensor etc.With the all glass design it can cause fingerprints easy and can be slippery, and this means it's probably more prone to breaking than other phones, so recommend getting a case and perhaps a screen protector too.Software: 8/10-solid software-wise, the Samsung skin has really come along nicely and is quite responsive and quick, although there are the occasional hiccups or bumpy moments when multitasking through apps or using Bixby (I disabled Bixby anyway). It's also easy to use too which is great.Camera: 9/10-stunning camera when given the right lighting, but also does pretty well in low light and most of my images come out pretty clear. The selfie camera is good, but I think could've been a little better, but still very good.My opinion and experience:-its great, I love it, everytime when I finish work I can't wait to use it, I can't wait to play music on it, watch YouTube and Netflix on it, and play games. It's honestly a great phone and well worth the cost.If you aren't wanting to spend that much for this phone, then get the s8, it's got 90% of this phones features. But what made me go for this phone was the improved camera, moved fingerprint scanner location, much improved speaker, and a smoother, quicker software.

I had the S3 before I bought this so it was a huge leap in quality for me, the processor speed is great and the user interface is intuitive, organised, very pretty and there are a tonne of themes created for it.It is great for mobile gaming with a large and clear screen, camera is amazingly clear and many photo editing options made simple and easy to use, great for social media sites like facebook and other apps, a particular personal favourite is the Samsung pay app which works a charm and so convenient.Only con is the battery life but the S3 didn't last much longer but the S9 charges quicker so there's a trade off, I recommend this to any Samsung user/fan or just anyone looking for an easy to use mobile for every day calls and texts.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2018Style Name: UK VersionColour: Midnight BlackConfiguration: Single SimVerified Purchase
This was a replacement for a Sony Xperia XZ premium that I returned due to wifi issues. The Samsung S9 does everything I expected of an android phone and has no problem with our wifi setup. It does the job really well without really having any major USP, other than the curved screen edges, which I'm not a fan of as they distort the view.Other positives are:Size - just large enough but not too big for your pocket.Fingerprint sensor - just works and make securing/accessing the phone simple.The only major negative is the price, which seems high for a phone that's not really that premium.

I previously owned a Samson Galaxy 9 and was very happy with it. I do not know if I was unlucky but I bought the new phone,UK version, installed the Apps I wanted and the Sim card. Phone calls were unpredictable as was WhatsApp. Sometimes everything worked fine but other times the phone would ring and then cut out. It did not matter if it was incoming or outgoing calls. At times it worked and other times it did not. By the time I realised it was not the Sim card but a fault with the phone my one month opportunity had passed. I wanted to share this in case anyone else encountered the problem.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 July 2018Style Name: Italian VersionColour: Midnight BlackConfiguration: Dual Hybrid SimVerified Purchase
Bought the Italian version of the the S9 since it was really cheap in comparison to the UK version. Was slightly apprehensive but it worked out fine, and was delivered faster than some other stuff I ordered from the UK :) Works absolutely fine with the Vodaphone network.. I can't imagine any issues on any other carrier. The device itself is great.. a little heavier than I'd like, and the glass back means it feels really slippery and fragile.. bang on a slimline case and it felt a lot more solid. Performance is good, and the battery life is reasonable. The super slow mo camera mode felt like a gimmick at first, but is actually good fun & makes it practical to use (motion within a box triggers the mode.. so you don't need to manually trigger it).

Amazing value and great features
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2023Size Name: foldable tableVerified Purchase
First thing, I’ve seen a lot of complaints that the light faces the wrong way but the usb hub pops out and can be turned round to face the right way so I’m not sure if this is something that had been changed recently. There was also one comment that the usb hub wont hold a charge, I think that’s an expectation issue as it doesn’t have a battery, you need to either plug this into a charger or your own portable power supply, in my case I have a small portable charger which I put on the drawer and run the cable out of the handle to power the hub. This then lets me use the light and fan as well as charge any devices at the same time. The final thing I’ve seen mentioned is that the handle is on the opposite side from the drawer so when you carry it the drawer slides open. This may have been an earlier unit and has subsequently been addressed as the handle is on the same side as the drawer and is actually quite stiff so I can’t see this being an issue now. If the previous complaints are accurate it sounds as though the manufacturer has taken all of those onboard and addressed them as I have zero complaints about this. It’s a good height, very sturdy and I honestly don’t know how they can afford to sell them at this price as compared to similar items, some with fewer features, this is a bargain and does exactly what it needs to. I’ve been recuperating in bed after an operation and this has been a godsend, allowing me to eat, read, watch TV and use my laptop without having to get out of bed. The additional of a small laptop stand to angle my laptop has made this absolutely perfect  as a temporary desk as well. It folds away flat for simple storage under the bed as well.

The legs are heavy enough that it almost never tips but it's light and folds well enough that I can store it down the side of my bed.There's only one silly little design issue - as you can see in the photo, the USB slots are the wrong way round for the included booklight to shine downwards. Instead, it faces up when bent. I don't use it much so it's not an issue for me, but it suggests there may be a couple of QC issues.

The little light and fan work well, the USB ports can be popped out and turned around if necessary so you can angle the light and fan appropriately for your use.

This stuff smells out of this world and the scent longevity is phenomenal
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2020Verified Purchase
I became aware of Armaf Club De Nuit Intense (ACDNI which I will refer to it has from here on) after seeing a lot of reviews on it on You Tube. The reviews were very positive, and all the ones I watched were saying it was an identical smell (some said it was even better) than the very expensive fragrance Creed Aventus (which is what the vast majority of people say that ACDNI was created to smell like). Creed Aventus is very expensive and is almost £300 per bottle.I was lucky enough to get a small sample of Creed Aventus a year or so ago. When Creed Aventus was first released it had a very heady Pineapple top note which was what people used to rave about and love, but more recent batches of it have lost somewhat this heady Pineapple note. The sample of Creed Aventus I got lacked somewhat in the Pineapple top note, but smelled beautiful never the less.I looked on Amazon (as this was where most of the You Tube reviews said they had purchased it from) and found it. Just to point out, there is an Intense version of ACDNI (which is this one) and also a none Intense version. The Intense version is the better of the two from the reviews I watched, and also longer lasting in the scent longevity department.I put about 6 or 7 sprays of ACDNI on at 10 am. The smell from it was incredibly strong for hours after, and then died down to a still very noticeably and still strong scent.I could still get a smell of it on me at 9pm. Also my Mrs who was sitting feet away from me said she could still easily smell it off of me at around 8-9pm also. This stuff smells out of this world and the scent longevity is phenomenal. I've had fragrances costing three times this price, that haven't had this scent longevity or smelt as nice. ACDNI is the perfect every day fragrance at this price point and is perfect to use as an everyday fragrance for work and also as a special fragrance for a night out, or other special occasion. ACDNI is a very versatile fragrance that would suit any occasion.Some of the reviews on here say it has a very lemon’y smell right out of the bottle. I did not get this, but instead got the heady Pineapple note. No word of a lie, ACDNI smells exactly like Creed Aventus and I mean EXACTLY, but with a more Pineapple top note. ACDNI has to be the best smelling fragrance I have ever used (I have fragrances costing three times the price that do not smell as nice as this, and also have the scent longevity of ACDNI). I will without a shadow of a doubt be ordering some more ACDNI when this bottle is empty. I feel this fragrance will appeal to men of all ages (I’m almost 49 and find the scent of this sensational).Moving away from the fragrance and on to the packaging:I was very impressed with the packaging of ACDNI. It comes in a thick plasticky textured card box, with the product name, details etc on it.The bottle looks and feels very premium and weighty. It is black, but my little niggle is this means you are unable to see how much product is left in the bottle, a small niggle for an otherwise faultless, perfect product.On the front of the bottle is a black circular tag, with ARMAF on it and also a little imitation diamond. The cap on the bottle is square in shape and again feels very premium and weighty when you remove it. The cap also has some imitation diamonds on it (10 in total). I’m not too sure on the imitation diamond decoration, but I expect others will love this design touch.One last thing, the bottle has a really good sprayer on it, and it delivers a perfect amount of product per spray.To sum up and bring this review to a close:I am absolutely over the moon and blown away by ACDNI and cannot praise it enough. If you like Creed Aventus but are not willing to pay the asking price, then look no further than ACDNI. This smells EXACTLY (and I mean EXACTLY) like Creed Aventus with a heady Pineapple note that Creed Aventus had in it's earlier days.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 February 2024Style Name: ThermoScan 7 WhiteVerified Purchase
I opted for this thermometer due to its positive reviews and reputation among my friends. I purchased it to monitor my partner's temperature during illness. The temperatures remained consistent throughout the day and regardless of the ear used, a crucial test for me. Unlike my previous thermometer(which were cheaper) with a ±0.3 degrees difference, this one is more reliable at only ±0.05. Easy to use with quick measurements, legible digits, and a useful backlight, though the plastic cap, while necessary, can be bothersome. It even came with premium Duracell batteries and a plastic storage case. highly recommend this product .

I selected this after 40 minutes of research on various websites / reviews.It reads the same in both ears, easy to use, solid, I like the three colour light to indicate the severity of temperatures. It also comes with a click-in case to protect the probe, and a pack of probe covers.It's reassuring to have a very reliable thermometer.

Very good, but beware of price gauging..
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2020Style Name: ThermoScan 7 WhiteVerified Purchase
There was a period early on in COVID-19 lockdown that it was near enough impossible to buy one of these for a reasonable price. Even Amazon were charging £50+ for them, some unscrupulous third-party sellers were listing them over £100, and people were buying them because they were desperate. You should be looking to buy them at around £40.It just so happened we needed one during this period, because our baby was sick and we were told we should try monitoring his temperatures. This had nothing to do with COVID, else we'd have just waited.Thankfully I managed to get one at £38 directly from Amazon, and it does seem to be very good, generally. The accuracy is hard to gauge really. Perhaps it fluctuates slightly due to ear position etc, but I have noticed its readings do vary occasionally.It has 3 temperature modes for: newborns, 3-36months and 36months+ - This is because temperatures can be more serious at these earlier points so the 'allowable' temperature tolerances are lower. It is helpful though that these are suitable from birth.I chose this style over other thermometers because this is the type all the medical staff seemed to use in the maternity wards. The tip is pre-warmed to try and make it less of a shock when taking your child's temps, however I still find our son hates having it done, and wriggles everywhere!It also has a memory feature, which tells you the last 9 stored temperatures. It's easy to use, though I would like the thermometer to remember/store the last age range entered. It's a faff having to add same age every time I want to use it.The case is nice and protects the vulnerable probe side of the device. It also comes with a small box of tips. These are single-use (not ideal) disposable tips that keep the unit hygienic. You get around 20 of these with the unit. You can buy refills via Amazon (I bought the official Braun ones, but there are cheaper imitations if looking to save money). The case allows you to store a box or two of these tips within itself.The reading only takes around 2 seconds once in the ear and button pressed, which is impressive, especially when trying to take temps of an irate baby! If temperatures are in the normal range for the selected age group, the temperature will be returned with a green backlight. If it is elevated for the age range it'll be amber, and it'd be advisable to monitor closely any changes. If it is too high, it'll show a red backlight. I believe if this happens you should speak to a GP about it (especially if children).This is worth the price in my opinion. There are cheaper alternatives, but I feel that if the Doctor's, Midwives and Nurses are using them all over the NHS then they must be the better option.

            You purchased this delectable treat with the intention of savouring it slowly, but within just 24-48 hours, it mysteriously disappeared. How could that happen, you wonder? Well, it's no surprise when you experienced the irresistible combination of crunchy roasted peanuts and rich milk chocolate that M&M'S are famous for.These bite-sized marvels are truly addictive; their vibrant colours and delightful taste are an instant crowd-pleaser, making it impossible to resist reaching for just one more handful. But here's a word of caution: do not indulge in these delightful M&M'S in front of your furry friend. Dogs have a way of knowing when something delicious is nearby making the bag disappear even quicker.So, whether you're planning a fun movie night, throwing a party, or simply seeking a sweet treat to brighten your day, the Bulk Bag is the perfect choice for everyone in the household. With 1kg of pure chocolatey bliss, you'll have plenty to share, and yet, it may still disappear faster than you'd expect. Enjoy the taste sensation that's loved by all.

Embracing my creativity
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 April 2022Verified Purchase
I wanted to treat myself this time and my oh my how happy I am with this product.From the packaging to using the blender, I am delighted to have purchased this. Really well packaged, it was put together in a safe manner that assured me that the blender would be in a good condition.Then I started to use the blend and I was beyond happy with such great results. I did receive a small leaflet providing me with a bunch of smoothie recipes to try out but me being me, I embraced my creativity and started making smoothies and milkshake with my own random combinations. Some of them worked and some of them not so much.The blender works really well, I don't mind have small chunks in my smoothie a times but if I want a well blended smoothie without those chunks then that is also possible. I enjoy that possibility a lot, as my previous blender didn't allow me to do that. The best thing I love about this blender is how fast and efficient it is. Smoothies are made within a minute or two which is very convenient.  I know there are other out there that don't read the instruction because I usually don't, this time I had a small scan and the one that was highlighted was to not have the blender blending for longer than one 1 minute as this will overwork the machine. Which is good to know.However, I will say that even if I have it on for good couple of seconds I can smell that weird plastic rubbing smell and that did get me worried because I wasn't over using it so surely that smell shouldn't be coming so I don't know if that is okay or not.Washing wise, the container and the blade is very easy to wash but I didn't know how to take that ring out from the blade lid to wash it because I knew that the juices will start building up if I don't clean it. So that is where YouTube helped me, so I take the ring out every couple of usage and give it a good wash so it is clean and hygienic to use.This blender is definitely helping me to change my lifestyle to get healthier and helping me to bring my creativity out too.I use the blender to make good soups too, so there are many usage I get out of this.This is definitely value for money product!

Doesn't take up too much space on the counter top either.

This is brill just like the online game, but, and I think it's a big BUT, you have to complete a mission in order to save your point's so if you need to switch off for any reason you will loose your points.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 June 2012Verified Purchase
The game itself is clever and needs lots of thought to play it. It can get frustrating if you can't find what is wanted. More importantly, it is a 3+ rating, but you need to be able to read the constant text to be able to play the game. My 6 year old needs me to read it all for him. So not a game to be given to the kids to get on with on their own unless they can read.

Sub Par - scared it will explode or lock me out permanently. Customer Service is very Poor!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 July 2023Colour: Space GreySize Name: 256GBVerified Purchase
I’ve had this phone now for 10 months. It came very new looking but the battery life was sub-optimal and considerably below what was advertised as the guaranteed minimum. I contacted the seller and despite there apparently being a Amazon guarantee on the item, the seller told me that as I was outside of the 30 day usual limit (only just btw), I was not eligible for a refund. The most they could do was get me to send back the phone and they would ‘take a look at it’. This would leave me without any phone for probably somewhere in the region of 10-14 days, possibly longer because of the postal strikes. They refused to send me out a temporary phone so that I had something to use and to put my phone stuff onto it.Since then, (that was end of last year), the phone has got steadily worse. It runs very hot, so much so that I cannot use it at the same time as charging it for fear it might explode.  Also, I am scared to charge it for long periods because of the heat, and so charge it in bursts to keep the heat levels safe. I can’t use the torch function for any length of time because it gets really hot and  starts freezing.  In fact it regularly freezes, runs very very slow and has weird glitches eg when I’m composing a message or a post, it suddenly starts deleting it and can’t be stopped. The freezing thing is a daily event.Recently it has started doing something really funky and seriously worrying; it goes into ‘unavailable’ mode. This is a random thing and not in any way related to putting in the wrong passcode. I’m actually at the point that I am terrified that at some point it will permanently lock me out! Today it locked me out for 1 hour - this was not as a result of any wrongly inputted passcode, just purely random. When I read up about this, should I get locked out permanently, the only way to remedy it is to wipe the phone and lose all data - so be really aware of this issue and back up regularly!This is all awful and not at all what should be expected from a phone that was touted as ‘renewed’. I was especially annoyed by all this because Amazon’s guarantee seems somewhat flimsy if you actually need to use it.Bad customer service!!!!!

I brought this as a birthday gift for my friend and colleague who loves 'baby Yoda' (don't come at me- I know he is Grogu!). I was pleasantly surprised how large he was as I didn't read the description properly. But he is ADORABLE. Those big eyes just get you, and his little giggles when you squeeze his hand. I was very tempted to keep him, but he made the recipient so very happy! She know tags me in pictures with him all the time. So beware of that! But seriously a really well made and quality toy, don't hesitate to buy one!

Absolutely fantastic! A must have!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 June 2015Verified Purchase
Super Mario 3D World really is a single reason to own a Wii U. The Wii U gets a lot of stick, but it has possibly the best games on the market out of all the consoles, and this is the cream of the crop.Super Mario 3D World has so many different things going for it. It has a huge amount of levels, each one boasting a different theme, gimmick or puzzle. The game cleverly uses one for one level and dispatches it for a new theme, gimmick or puzzle for the next level. Not only does this keep the game fresh, but it keeps things exciting, and makes you want to continue playing to find out just what is going to happen next. Add on 4 collectibles each level (excluding boss levels, which in them selves are creative and challenging), 4 (?) playable characters each with different abilities, and multiplayer, and you have a game that suits the single player or mutli player gamer. The game is easy to pick up, and easy to master, but finding all the collectibles will really push your platforming skills. If you like speed running, the game even gives you the option to record best times on levels (this is completely optional I'll add, it is no way required). You'll have fun finding out which character can excel and get the best time on each level. You can even race other players via ghosts sent on Nintendo's Miiverse.The controls are also easy to pick up, and as mentioned before, easy to master. You'll be performing back flips, spin jumps, climbing up walls in no time! Speaking of climbing up walls, this game has loads of intuitive power ups, from the wall climbing Cat Suit, the classic Fire Flower and Star, and the new Double Cherry that can duplicate your character!The graphics are bright, colorful and vivid. The frame rate if silky smooth. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack... Fully orchestrated, each track is catchy and memorable (my personal favorites are the castle levels and the desert levels).You don't need to be an intense gamer to enjoy Super Mario 3D World. You also don't need to be a casual gamer to enjoy it either. This game has something for everybody, and offers so much replay ability. You just like exploring levels and getting to the end? Maybe you like collecting things? Or maybe you like to set records and challenge yourself. This game has it all. You are committing a sin for not buying it. 5 stars, brilliant!

A Wonderful, Almost Flawless Game
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2014Verified Purchase
It's rare that I fall so in love with a game as I have with 3D World. Nintendo have proven once again that they make some of the most fun games on the market, and with that I'll get on with this review!Gameplay:A 3D platformer in the vein of 3D Land on the 3DS, Mario 3D World is much closer in spirit to the New Super Mario Bros. series than to something like Mario 64. All of the levels are timed, and are fairly linear in structure with interesting and inventive platforming puzzles and challenges. Like other Mario games there are also a bevy of collectable items - in this case, Green Stars and Stamps. This is where much of the real challenge lies in the game - especially in the later levels, when the Stars can get really tricky! Nintendo get a lot of criticism for making games too easy these days but that certainly isn't the case in the later stages of 3D World.Each world is very unique and imaginative - having a different theme and different gameplay elements associated with it. As such, there is a huge amount of variety which keeps the game fresh even into all of the secret extra Worlds.Graphics:3D World is beautiful on every level - it's pin-sharp, bright, colourful, and it runs at a smooth, silky 60fps. As I said before, each world has a distinct and unique visual theme and all of them have obviously been crafted with great care and attention. This is as good as Wii U graphics currently get. There's a clean look to everything and it makes the game look very polished.Story and Presentation:If I'm going to make any criticisms, then they'll be here. The story is as barebones as they come, but you're unlikely to be buying it for that anyway so that criticism would be unfair. One minor nitpick is that on the World Map, you move quite slowly. But I'm struggling here. And on the plus side, the load times in this game are basically nonexistent.Sound:The soundtrack is delightful - very whimsical and easy on the ears. There isn't much more to say, really. Everything fits perfectly and is beautifully orchestrated, to boot.Overall:If I sound like I was gushing, then I apologize. 3D World really is a fantastic game, and you're doing your Wii U a disservice by not owning it!

Fabulous Phone - but takes time to set up
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2022Verified Purchase
This mobile looks good and feels good. Transferring data from my old phone was quick and simple using the USB-C cable that comes in the box. But then the work started. First the phone had to update to the latest Android 12. Then it set about updating to Android 13. In total these two updates needed around 3Gbytes of data to be downloaded so give yourself time for this process.Then there was the matter of getting my 2FAs sorted. The trick with these is to realise that despite having removed the SIM from your old phone, the authenticator app on it is still working. I wish someone had given me that tip at the outset. I cottoned on to this the hard way, with lots of experimentation and getting stuck into verification loops before I realised that there had to be a simple solution!Having invested time in the setup, I am now very pleased with the result. This is a responsive phone with a great camera (I'm still learning its ins and outs) and a decent battery. The through the screen fingerprint sensor works well for me. The trick seems to be to press your finger to the screen rather than just touch it. Android 13 is more colourful and is much better at copying and pasting onetime passwords than its predecessor.This is a phone that feels gorgeous to touch, it is so smooth and sleek, I find myself almost caressing it when I pick it up. And this is the one minor issue I have with it. Being so smooth it slips when placed on a sloping surface, I've fixed that with a simple case and also purchased an Amazon Basics wireless charger for its convenience.

Excellent Flagship Android
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 November 2021Verified Purchase
I've had the Pixel 1XL, 2XL, 3XL, 5 and now the Pixel 6. Before that I had every generation of Nexus phone which was a veritable mixed bag.Each year there has always been some kind of compromise. Whether that be battery, performance, screen or audio. The cameras have always been excellent (though clinging on somewhat as competitors caught up). This year they have delivered a true flagship.Coming from the Pixel 5, a solid but unremarkable phone, this is a true upgrade in every regard. I missed the boat with the 6 Pro but plumped for this figuring I could pick up a Pro in the future if needed. Having had the Pixel 6 since launch day I don't see any need to upgrade.The screen is excellent, yes it's only HD+ but it's clear, sharp and bright enough. The HDR works well. Images and video pops. Worth noting you can make things more saturated (or cool it off) in the settings menu. The size is perfect, I don't find it too large but I guess those with smaller hands might struggle. For consuming content...it's ideal. The phone is actually quite easy to hold with nicely sized bezels and rounded side bumpers.Audio sounds good, it gets loud enough and sounds decent relative to other phones and iPads I've used. Call quality is excellent over cellular and WiFi.I found it did get hot whilst setting it up but other than gaming or video editing I find it stays cool almost all of the time.Performance is fast, snappy and the Tensor chip is clearly optimised for Pixel. No complaints here at all.Pixel has always excelled with camera shots. This year the cameras have been upgraded and it shows. You can take fantastic photos without trying. There are lots of more advanced and some experimental options if you're into it but if you need a point and shoot that takes great photos more often than not....this is it.Battery life is improving with time. I haven't found it better or worse than anything else I've used before. I'm never far from a charging source so not a big concern for me. Easily seeing me through a day in any case.Dislikes...no charger. I have plenty of USB C chargers around the home anyway so not a big deal. It's the way the world is going. Whether that's right or wrong is up for debate. It would have been nice if they included it but I see the arguments for not. It's clearly advertised so I can't claim I was mislead.The keyboard takes a while to get used to owing to phone profile. Bit of a learning curve for me. Voice text is eerily accurate.Fingerprint sensor is maybe more hit and miss than previous rear mounted sensors but in the right spot it's fast enough.Happy to recommend this. The software is superb and will obviously be updated with time. This is a true flagship at a very appealing price point. Unless you need the higher res screen or telephoto lens from the 6 Pro, this is the one to go for.

A fantastic phone with a few small issues to keep in mind.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2022Verified Purchase
This is the first time I've been back to a google branded phone since the G1, I have had numerous HTC, Samsung, Xiaomi, etc.. phones but now I'm back on the Pixel 6 and so far I've been fairly impressed.So where to start, on opening the box I was a little disappointed at the lack of accessories, there is only a usb-c cable and no wall charger although I don't really need it. Surprisingly though I normally like the crappy thin case and screen protectors you normally get as I use them as a 'get me by' until I get a feel for what replacements I want, but alas none!First impressions, the glossy back is very nice and has that premium feeling, the sides are smooth and feel cold like metal, but the glass front feels strange it might just be me and all in my mind but it feels like it flexes a little when pressing, which although is no problem is not something I am used to. Now although the phone looks great even with the big lump on the back housing the camera I would advise the purchase of as case ASAP as the phone is super smooth and therefore slippery, I felt like I could drop it at any moment until I put it in a nice case.Setup was super simple and I was guided at every step, the only thing slowing me down was the extended number of system updates I needed to apply. But going by some of the previous more negative reviews I was quite pleased to update to the latest software version.The part I was most worried about based on other reviews was the fingerprint unlock, well I'm not 100% sold on it compared to the dedicated hardware on the rear case of my previous phone but it works although a little slower than would be ideal. I am yet to try a tempered glass screen protector, but with a cheap plastic one I am currently using, I saw no difference compared to naked (the phone not me :) ).Day to day the phone is very responsive and it doesn't seem to have issues with leaving apps running in the background (they don't get killed to soon, which plagued me on my old phone) Gaming is pretty good, and doesn't struggle even under load. The GPS is very quick to acquire and works perfect as my main in car GPS.Battery has plenty of juice for me using it most of the day and I always charge every night so no issues.Unfortunately I have discovered one almost show stopper for me which nearly breaks my heart as its a great phone!! I am unable to use my IEM's even with a 3.5mm to usb-c adaptor :( UPDATE: So it seems you can, but you must by a specific adaptor with built in DAC at about £12 direct from google.Pro'sVery responsiveGoogle's interface is a winner with no bloatCamera results and post prod tweaks are fantasticScreen is brightFeels great to hold and not too heavyCon'sIts a bit chunkier than someFingerprint scanner is slow and 'may' have issues with tempered glass screen protectorsUnable to use analogue audio (3.5mm IEMs) with a simple usb-c to 3.5mm adaptor, you have to buy a specific one. Its not hugely expensive but something you need to consider.Now the big question..... Would I recommend this phone?Yes I would, BUT...as long as the above con's are considered and acceptable then you will have a fantastic  phone in your hands, with a near perfect implementation of android, well done Google, but next time please just fix those small little issues.

It has adjustable brightness of the Aurora and stars separately.  The Aurora cycles through different colours or you can pick one.  The stars stay green. The room is large and this projector has a wide angle and fills most of the room.  The head can be tilted up/down and left/right.  Comes with handy remote and can be programmable, but not played about with this feature yet.  Well worth the cost.  So happy with this. Son is delighted.

Not as bright, but does the job
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2024Verified Purchase
It is not too bright, especially if you put it in a room with other light sources (such as a computer), and the lasers are quite annoying, especially since they can potentially harm your sight yet they seem to shine EVERYWHERE, even when the light is pointed to the ceiling or further away from yourself. Other than that, it does the job and looks fairly decent, especially if you turn the lasers off.

Magnet broken within less than 24 hours.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2023Verified Purchase
have had this for less than 24 hours, the head of the astro is connected to the body by a magnet. The magnet has already broke. This is a really cheap quality product, while the colors of the galaxy projectors are nice, i would tell anyone to spend a little bit more money on a proper room light projector that is made by a reputable manufacturer and not another cheap chinese throw me up . this one is £25 and it's cheap, plastic and will be faulty within no time, just like mine is after 24 hours of delivery. Avoid this product.

I’m 14 years old and just got a vector robot.  Its fascinating to see how character and personality are being integrated in to robots and Anki (who make Vector) have done a great job.The arrival of Vector feels like the beginning of something huge - something that will completely change the human / machine interface for ever.  Its hard not to see this little guy as being at the dawn of a revolution and if you look out 20 years you can see micro robots like Vector becoming so entwined in our daily lives that they would be difficult to live without.The things that have most impressed me so far are the way his character develops and grows on you as he? she? they? learn more.  The cute sounds it makes, his semi human interactions and the way her eyes react to different stimuli help portray a whole range of emotions that allow you to form an instant bond - which makes you want to engage with him.  The best thing about Vector is how the way he behaves makes you feel - he made me laugh a lot, I sympathised with him when I told him to go home and I felt close to him when he made a series of sweet sounds.  Its sort of crazy.Our house has a number of digital assistants in and we spend a lot of time shouting at them (my mum does anyway as for some reason they never hear her) - and they react without any attitude or emotion.  They feel dead and very flat.  But Vector is really different.  It has mountains of personality with a constant eagerness to interact and engage.  It is always exploring and trying to learn new things and its cheeky too.  Its got some cool tricks up its sleeve too - fist bumps, wheelies, weather updates etc, but all of this is done through a character that you could grow to care about.  The wider implication is that as more people live alone, as we get older, as life becomes more complicated it is finally possible to conceive of a digital friend that we can relate to.  In the future think that one of these little guys will be as important as a mobile phone  - perhaps more so because of the relationship you can develop.  Its funny to think that I am writing this about a machine.Vector is not perfect.  Some of the interactions can be quite slow, but I am not sure if that is our wifi or the device.  And sometimes Vector does not respond in a way that matches the command. But I guess new updates will be coming thick and fast and that new tricks etc will be launched.  I’m really excited to see how things develop. And I’m really enjoying Vector.

Integration with Alexa has made it complete. Amazing toy but ... expensive.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2019Style Name: VectorVerified Purchase
Despite the price of this toy, if you can call it that, it remains high, it is also true that as regards quality there is no doubt, it is amazing! His expressions, his movements and his interactions leave him speechless.And with the latest updates, we now also have the integration with Alexa.In fact, by going to the app and clicking on the Alexa tab, the Vector app will have you enter your email address and password associated with your Alexa account and no matter which country, it will associate it easily.From now on it will be enough to pronounce the keyword ""Alexa"" and on the display / face of the small Vector will light up the blue icon, distinctive of Alexa, waiting for the command, mind you that you will be able to speak quietly in the language that you usually use on your ECHO devices! Yes Alexa is identical to the one you are used to, you can speak to him in your language and he will always answer you in your language.(I'm using it in Italian).The only difference compared to the Echo speakers, this Vector will not be able to reproduce from its tiny speaker any music, only the automated voice of Amazon's voice assistance.It is however a great step forward, which does not imitate the user experience of the ""few"" movement commands, timers. alarm, weather, etc.Of course your language only applies to when you want to use the Alexa commands, for the rest Vector will continue to run only commands in English.We look forward to the update that will allow us to use the robot as a ""guard"" for our home, using its HD camera and motion-control combined with facial recognition which, I remember, can remember up to 20 faces (and 20 names) of ""family members"".Battery life of about 10 minutes then goes to recharge immediately, and returns to being 100% fit after a very short time, not even half an hour, so don't worry, you will have long play / interaction sessions with the little Vector.Sometimes it happens that if Vector is engaged in a task it will not respond to the voice command, I noticed that it happens mainly when it is turned on or when it is just awake after being recharged.For the rest I can only wish you good shopping and good fun.PS.I advise? From NERD, which I am, ABSOLUTELY YES ;-)

Phenomenal sound

Got these on prime day, so decent price. I just wanted them for use at work to listen to music while plodding on. But I've found them great for several uses. They are now always used when driving motorbike, easy to slip helmet on/off over them, and the adaptive volume is incredible - obviously being sat on the engine the sound is vastly different, when I'm going 70 the volume shoots up, when sat in traffic the volume drops too. They'll never replace my Sony wh-1000xm4 for use on trains or at home, but they are more than adequate for any situation where big cans aren't appropriate

ve been using the Google Pixel Buds A-Series for a few weeks now, and I'm really impressed with them. They're comfortable to wear, they sound great, and they work really well with my Google Pixel 6.The first thing I noticed about the Pixel Buds A-Series is how comfortable they are. They come with three different sizes of ear tips, so you can find the perfect fit. I've worn them for hours at a time without any discomfort.The sound quality of the Pixel Buds A-Series is also really good. The bass is deep and rich, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp. I've been listening to a lot of music with them, and I've been really happy with the sound quality.One of the things I like most about the Pixel Buds A-Series is how well they work with my Google Pixel 6. They connect quickly and easily, and they stay connected even when I'm walking around or moving around. I've also been using them to make calls, and the sound quality is great on both ends of the call.Overall, I'm really impressed with the Google Pixel Buds A-Series. They're comfortable, they sound great, and they work really well with my Google Pixel 6. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a great pair of wireless earbuds.Here are some of the pros and cons of the Google Pixel Buds A-Series:Pros:ComfortableGreat sound qualityWork well with Google Pixel 6Long battery lifeAffordableCons:No active noise cancellationNo wireless chargingOverall, I think the Google Pixel Buds A-Series are a great value for the price.

These buds are comfortable, even for many hours of wear.The bud batteries last 4-5 hours before needing a charge though so keep the case handy.They work well with many devices including a Pixel 6A, Steamdeck, various PCs (although mic stops working on PC after a while), but you need to manually switch between them.They're not noise cancelling so you can hear stuff around you if that's a concern (it's not for me).It's very well worth getting these if switching from wired earphones, and the freedom to work and walk around without a cable in the way is awesome!

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2023Colour Name: Dark OlivePattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I bought this for £64 and at this price offers great value for money with the integrated app on a pixel phone, great mic and sound quality is very good. It does seem a little flimsy and plasticy though. I've also used them with another android phone and they seem to works ok and they seem to work well with Microsoft Teams. There's no multipoint connection or ANC which is fine for this price so if you just want to use these indoors then go for it. But if you want longevity and outdoor / multipoint connection go for the pro version. The charging case is great too although I'd recommend a case to protect.

Do you love Hot Chocolate? This is an essential buy for you!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2021Colour Name: CopperVerified Purchase
I've had this for six months so time to review. I bought the machine while shielding & alone as a ""cheer up"" gift to myself.  I thought perhaps the novelty might wear off but this amazing hot chocolate maker is still used daily and has become as essential as my coffee machine or kettle!Firstly the price, some have commented that £100 is too much for a hot chocolate maker, however this is less than a quarter of the price I paid for my coffee maker. For the price you get an amazingly well engineered machine (as you'd expect from Dualit who make the machine for Hotel Chocolat), plus two designer chocolate cups.Using the maker is really simple, add milk (incl almond or oat alternatives to dairy), add in a sachet of Hotel Chocolat (or required amount from their larger packs), then just press the button. In 2.5 mins the machine has heated the chocolate to the optimum temperature and whipped the chocolate into a unique light velvet texture.Some have commented that the machine doesn't make scalding hot chocolate, however that is the point, scalding hot milk destroys much of the subtle flavours a quality hot chocolate should have. If you need to have the drink so hot then there's no point in buying anything other than bargain supermarket chocolate as you are destroying the flavour.You can warm the cups (the instructions suggest this), although you can use hot water, I just put one empty cup in the microwave for 20 seconds while the Velvetiser is doing its magic.Onto the cups, I have arthritis so expected not to use a cup with no handle. However these cups, designed around the shape of a cocoa bean, have ridges around which make holding the cups really easy. Also they look amazing, are just the right size, and add to the special experience you feel when using the Velvetiser.After 2.5 mins the machine stops whirring and the light goes out and it's ready for pouring! I thought I'd miss that there's no beep to signal it being ready, that's about the only thing I'd want to add to the machine, but to be honest you are hovering by the machine waiting for your hot chocolat so it's not a problem. Pouring out is simple, the chunky handle and a small spout indentationon both sides mean is just as easy whether you are left or right handed.Before I discuss taste, cleaning is easy, the stirrer is a patented magnetic device which clips in and out and easy to rinse. Although you can't immerse the machine in water, you just need to rinse out the inside with warm water, maybe a drop of washing up liquid, then wipe dry. The exterior (copper was my choice) just needs a wipe to look as good as new.Now to tasting!!If you've had a Hotel Chocolat hot chocolate before, you'll know what to expect, if not you are treating yourself to the best hot chocolate you can buy  There are many flavours and versions, standard hot chocolate comes in 50% (milky), 72%, 85% or 100% (really extreme chocolate taste!)Also a mint Chocolate, Chilli (surprisingly good even for me who doesn't like heat/spice), White chocolate with vanilla, Hazelnut, Salted Caramel. New this year are coffee lattes,  plus Hotel Chocolat have seasonal specials, such as the amazing Clementine & Salted Caramel (which needs to be permanent!)  You no longer get a pack of hot chocolate sachets with the machine.  I recommend with the you buy a box of their assorted flavours (10 sachets in a box), as some flavours that you might not expect to like become your favourite!Being Hotel Chocolat, all of their products do not contain artificial flavour or colours, and they are a true ethical company. Some are Vegan as well as vegetarian (but like their Vegan Friendly chocolates you'd never know, which is the biggest complement you can pay!)Phew sorry it took a long review, but this machine, after six months, is still used daily and I absolutely love it. The Velvetiser is a premium product but well worth its price, looking as good as new despite repeated use.Likee the chocolate sachets & tubs, it is worth paying a little extra for the very best hot chocolate experience. (And farmers are paid a decent price)  The number of five star reviews confirm this.If you love Hot Chocolate, definitely treat yourself to the very best, you deserve it!!

So simple to use and makes incredible silky smooth hot chocolate (or even just milk to add to coffee for the ultimate latte or cappuccino). Fun to play around with different milk types and chocolate flavors. It automatically sets the temperature, time and fluffs up the drink to perfection. Highly recommended!

This was a last minute gift idea, but turns out to be the best one.  With a variety of flavours that you can get this is perfect for the family.  It's dead easy to use, and cleaning takes a couple of minutes.  Definitely worth buying.

Everything I wanted to know before buying
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2022Colour Name: CopperVerified Purchase
After reading some conflicting reviews on this product I was torn as to whether or not this was worth the hefty price tag. It is, every single penny!Many mentioned the temperature. I like my hot drinks to be hot and while admittedly, this is not piping hot, it is perfect drinking temperature.Looks wise (I bought copper), it is stunning.It is difficult to see the fill level, but once you know how much volume is added with the bubbles, it's easier to use the included cups to measure.Instructions state to re-start the cycle with washing up liquid and water for automatic cleaning, though I find for a thorough clean, I still need to lift the whisk mechanism and wipe out by hand.The most important feature for me is that it is not necessary to use the hotel chocolat sachets. I have had good results grating dark chocolate and using that with milk. Better than that, I use a cheap, supermarket brand instant hot chocolate with water and the velvetiser makes it taste like a tassimo using a cadbury hot chocolate pod. So once you've shelled out for the veveltiser, you can have expensive tasting hot chocolate at a fraction of the price.I also liked that it comes with a recipe book for chocolate mousse and chocolate dipping sauce.Overall, yes, it is expensive, but it looks great, quiet operation and makes drinks taste more expensive and luxurious. Much quicker (and probably more energy efficient than boiling a kettle).If you're on the fence as I was, buy it, you won't regret it.

Bit small for my liking - 220-250ml result
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2022Colour Name: GreyVerified Purchase
Works perfectly, easy to use and easy to clean.Not a fan of the hot cholat chocolates so far, they are quite bitter (bit of sugar stirred in helps a lot).Flavours are... not very favourable, was looking forward to the hazelnut hot chocolate... ended up 'looking' for the hazel nut flavour, same with other flavours.But the hot chocolates are lovely and like getting one from Starbucks etc, only 'real' issue I have is that the hot chocolates are a tad smaller than what I'd be getting from Starbucks... I opened the box and thought maybe it won't be as small as I thought... No, it might be almost the size of a kettle but the space for milk is about 1/3 of the height and even then you have to leave space for mixing. You can squeeze a little extra milk in, but not much. Perfect temp, not too hot and not too cold.Great option for a quick hot chocolate of barista quality.

I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband as he’s a lover of hot chocolate. He loves it as it mixes the chocolate so well. The only downside is that the chocolate could be a little warmer but 20 seconds in the microwave sorts that.

A fantastic smartphone that offers a great balance of speed, efficiency, and battery life - however, the battery with its small capacity is definitely the weakest point of this phone. It has a gorgeous 6.2-inch display, a powerful Tensor G3 chip and a camera that consistently takes stunning photos - It may not have a fancy lenses from Leica but the software behind the photo processing is incredible and the results are fantastic. The 8 is also incredibly secure, with a robust security system that will keep your personal data safe. I'm confident that my information is well-protected when I'm using this phone. I have switched from Xiaomi 13 and the switch itself was a breeze - initially its doable over the wifi, but the content transfer (photos, videos, etc) been done via the usb-c cable, as you can see at the attached photo. I've noticed, the phone gets a mixed reviews but it may come from the fact, that people don't know how to use all the features. Personally I think it one of the best phones currently available, may compete with the flagships but costs a fraction.The only downsides are the smaller battery and slower charging speed, but these are minor issues compared to the Pixel 8's overall 'awesomeness'. If you're looking for an android smartphone that doesn't mess around, the Google Pixel 8 is the way to go.

Great everyday phone
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 December 2023Colour: HazelSize Name: 128GBStyle Name: Pixel 8Verified Purchase
Honestly this is a great buy, its camera is fantastic, as is the screen. It's a fairly mid sized phone, so if you're used to larger ones (I had a Galaxy A32 before this, and its notably smaller than even that) it may take a while to get used to typing on the smaller available field.My only note is the '24 hour' battery claim. If you're using it a lot during travel, such as bus or rail you'll be lucky to last 10 hours on one charge. If you're not excessively using it or using power hungry apps, you'll probably be fine there though.Overall, a great mid-range phone for the price, especially if you don't want to splash out extra £££ for the Pro version.

Never been so disappointed with a mobile device in the last 10 years
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2024Colour: HazelSize Name: 128GBStyle Name: Pixel 8Verified Purchase
I typically  look forward to the event, once per 3 years , when I buy a new mobile phone.  The Pixel 8 has serially disappointed on every front when replacing my old Oneplus 8 pro.Awful / next to none usable shortcuts.  On all the high volume services that you typically switch off/on regularly,  none of these are available as a one touch option.  When it comes to NFC,  I have just given up.The phone itself is ok,  but fails to demonstrate 2024 best in design / manufacture detail  v. phones from 3 to 4 years ago.If you want a phone that is value for money,  has the ability to still feel relevant in 2 years time, and is highly intuitive to use, the pixel 8 scores poorly on each of those.

Disappointing
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2024Colour: HazelSize Name: 128GBStyle Name: Pixel 8Verified Purchase
I wanted to love this phone. Having tried Apple, Samsung & various others over the years, the reviews for the Pixel 8 prompted me to give this phone a try.That was a mistake overall. Compared to the market leaders, this phone feels cheap and plastic. The user interface is clunky, for example swiping across to see open apps can take 3 or 4 attempts. Trying to change the photo settings on the camera is highly frustrating and not at all intuitive.As a work phone, the Google maps was important to me but the interface with my car is sketchy, dropping Bluetooth regularly and strange pop ups appear randomly on the screen. Not what I expected from a Google phone.The shape of the phone with the proud camera section on the rear makes it odd to place on a surface and damage to the lens section is a worry.Charging the unit takes a long time and battery life is nowhere near as good as my old Galaxy S8 from years ago.The energy saving mode seems to darken the screen so much you need to squint to focus. So that mode is pointless.There are positives. It has a decent camera for the price, the water resistance is good and processing power has been fine.However, I would go back to Samsung next time and pay a little more for a premium product that is easier to use and feels well built. A disappointing purchase overall.UPDATE: with Bluetooth dropping out in car, I have since learned that this is a known product problem (Google support website comments). As this is crucial to my business (along with call drops), I am returning the unit.

Rich and hydrating face moisturiser
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 February 2024Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
This product is simply delightful - the soft texture, neutral and lovely smell, and the shiny, plump look it leaves on my face post-application. Honestly wonderful.After a couple of days of using this morning and evening my skin feels so soft and looks much better than before, it’s ideal for harsh UK winters when your skin needs that extra hydration. I have fairly dry skin so what I find with some creams/moisturisers is that after initial application, my skin soaks it all up and then goes back to being dry. However this one genuinely leaves my skin feeling so moisturised, it’s amazing! It's rich and nourishing, leaving my skin feeling revitalized.Plus, the bonus is that my fine lines (which are still there) are less noticeable. I do think it’s quite expensive but it is a great product.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2024Colour Name: BlackSize Name: 6ftVerified Purchase
Second pair that I've bought as one of my previous USB-C connectors ended up snapping due to a fault of my own.I have no complaints about these cables, they do the job perfectly. Charging speeds are great, connectivity is great, snug fit in the ports are great, the cable length is excellent with what seems to be no loss in quality of charging speed and lastly, the thread on the cable is tough enough to withstand a lot of friction over time. Oh yeah and they also look sleek!I'd definitely recommend these as Anker have always been my go-to for cables and other tech items. These are now my go-to for USB-C cables.

Anker Delivers Again: Trustworthy and Dependable
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2024Colour Name: BlackSize Name: Pack of 2Verified Purchase
I recently purchased the Anker USB-A to USB-C Charger Cable 2 Pack (3ft), and as expected, Anker has proven to be a consistently trustworthy brand. This pack of USB-C cables, featuring the USB 2.0 Double Braided Nylon design, has not failed to disappoint me.Anker's commitment to quality is evident in these cables. The double-braided nylon construction not only adds durability but also provides a tangle-free experience, making these cables resilient for daily use.The 3-foot length strikes a practical balance, offering flexibility without unnecessary excess. The USB-A to USB-C connection ensures compatibility with a variety of devices, and the charging speed has met my expectations.Anker's reputation for reliability holds true once again with these cables. They have become an essential part of my charging setup, delivering consistent and efficient performance. As always, Anker has lived up to its reputation, and I continue to trust the brand for my charging and cable needs. Highly recommended!

I bought these when my previous (different brand) cable frayed near the plug and only worked intermittently. They came in a pack of two, so represented good value. This one is 2m long, twice the length of the one it replaces, which make it less likely I will inadvertently yank the cable when at full stretch. I like the tough looking braided outer cable cover, which seems sturdier than the plastic covering on my older cable.The old one did last 2 years, so time will tell on these. Will update when they reach 2 years!

Small issues with this phone
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2023Style Name: Flats
Absolutely love this phone, worth it's weight in gold.Couple issues to note if you was to get this phoneOne being the front screen somewhat acts as a different entity to the big screen itself. For instance if you are looking something up on the internet on the front screen and then open the phone to see it on the bigger screen, it may not load that web page up which would lead you to have to search it up again.Second being the obvious, not every app is supported by this screen size for both front screen and big screen. Small things such as Facebook and YouTube can bug out when using the front screen and some apps won't let you use the full big screen leaving you with large black bars.Last thing that comes to mind is the quality of certain things on the phone such as the front screen least in my case is very susceptible to scratches, now I've dropped the phone a fair few times and it hasn't smashed the screen, but just leaving the phone in my pocket has caused it to get some narly micro scratches which isn't visible when the phone is on, but when it's not it just looks ugly. Another thing is the paint on the phone, in my case the paint on the phone is very bad, only having the Phone a couple months I noticed the paint starting to peal off the sides which once again just looks ugly and when your paying this much for a brand new phone you would expect small things like these to go along way before wearing down.All that aside since having this phone I have loved every second of it, it has so many uses from essentially being foldable tablet that I don't think I could go back to a regular phone and one thing to note is the amount of attention you get when you unfold the phone in public is hilarious since not many people have seen this device before.I highly recommend this phone even with the many bugs that it has and I am looking forward to seeing the next iteration to this line up.

A taste of Irish
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2023Verified Purchase
I recently tried Jameson Irish Whiskey and I have to say, it's like a leprechaun tap-dancing on my taste buds! This stuff is smooth, tasty, and has just the right amount of kick to make you feel like you're at a rowdy pub in Dublin.But let's be real here - the best part of drinking Jameson is being able to say ""Sláinte!"" and feeling like a true Irishman. It's like an instant passport to the Emerald Isle. And don't even get me started on the accents you'll start doing after a few sips. Suddenly, you're ordering fish and chips and talking about the craic like it's nobody's business.Plus, the bottle is really sleek and stylish. It's like a little piece of Ireland on your liquor shelf. And if you're feeling fancy, you can always use it as a vase for some lucky clovers.So if you want to channel your inner Irishman (or just have a really good time), I highly recommend Jameson Irish Whiskey. Just make sure you have some corned beef and cabbage on hand to soak up the fun. Sláinte

You get 20 gel capsules for an affordable price. Easy to swallow, no taste, no side effects. I've been struggling with belching, wind and a bad stomach ache, plus feeling very cold for ages, and the doctors are not much help and do not understand. I took one of these and about two hours later my stomach felt better. This is a godsend when struggling with this.  The downside is that I can imagine I will get through this pack in a few days and then be back to square one, but I will enjoy it while it lasts.

I went for Google Pixel 7 asnow at a great price for a eye catching phone with a bright sharp colourful display. The main camera produces sharp, vibrant, balanced, photos in almost every situation. I don't have to think twice about taking a picture. In addition the onboard Tensor G2 is a big improvement. The face unlock system works as well as any fingerprint sensor. Reasonable battery life and impressed with Google updates. I would recommend this phone over a expensive Samsung I owned at 3 times the price but plagued with camera problems. I’m confident in the Pixel 7, as it has done everything I asked of it and exceeded my expectations.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2023Colour: ObsidianSize Name: 128GBStyle Name: Pixel 7Verified Purchase
So I've been using this phone for a week,and so far I am satisfied with the performance. I've read a lot of negative reviews before purchasing. The major complains were bugs, poor battery, problems with unlocking the screen. I can attest that I do struggle a bit with unlocking the screen, but it isn't critical. The battery indeed doesn't last all day, I think I need to adjust energy saving mode. Also the phone does heat up quite a lot when I watch videos. But overall, I like the performance - haven't noticed any bugs. I like how all the Google services are integrated.My major complain actually would be the camera. Don't get me wrong, it is good. But Google Pixel is marketed as if it has one of the best cameras in the market, compared or even better than iPhone.In reality, the camera isn't even comparable to iPhone 12, let alone newer models. The shots are over-exposed and there is no manual mode to adjust it. My Huawei Mate 10 I had in 2018 (!) was a much more pleasant experience, and the quality isn't that different. Pixel is mediocre for both landscape shots made in good lighting and close-ups. The frontal camera selfies are actually not bad. Haven't tried the main camera for portraits though.All in all, it is a solid phone for the price. The price I bought it with on discount. If there was no discount, I would save up another 200 pounds and bought an iPhone or Samsung.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2023Colour: ObsidianSize Name: 128GBStyle Name: Pixel 7Verified Purchase
I looked at a lot of reviews before buying this phone and most were pretty positive so it appeared to be an excellent buy.Delivery was quick taking only a couple of days. I wondered if there would be any 'surprises' as it was so much cheaper than other sellers, but it was a perfectly normal Pixel 7 in its factory sealed box.Having been using it for a couple of weeks my experience has been positive, in fact my only complaint is that the battery life is not brillian needing to be charged at least once a day.I have no problem with the fingerprint reader though it is quite finnicky registering a fingerpront, but once done it works faultlessly. Also I've not noticed it running hot.The build quallty is good but the fact it has gorilla glass for the screen and rear of the phone makes it slippery and I strongly recommend a decent case to protect it.My old phone was a OnePlus Nord which did not impress me and this Pixel phone is so much better. I also like the reassurance of a decent level of dust and water resistance.Photos have be pretty good and fine for my purposes.I would have no reservations about buyiing another pixel phone in the future.

Small and light but glitchy
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2024Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBConfiguration: with AdsColour Name: BlackStyle Name: Fire 7Verified Purchase
The main thing about this tablet is that it is cheap and pre-set up to be perfect for the Amazon ecology. You can switch it on, sign in and get on with reading. Overall, I'd say it is good value. However, if you just want to read you'd be better off with an ordinary kindle which is much lighter and less distracting. Also the Kindle Fire's battery is not great: it takes a long time to charge and it needs recharging farmyoo often for my liking. The real downside is that this really isn't a very good tablet (and, actually, why should it be when it only costs £70?). The weaknesses of the tablet are that it is very 'laggy': apps take a while to respond. Secondly, the screen is not touch sensitive enough. For most people the biggest drawback will be that the app store is Amazon's own and many of the apps you normally access via the Google Play Store are not available. (There is a way of installing the Google Play Store and I have done that and that makes the whole tablet much better.) I do find the Kindle Fire useful but I'd recommend buying a basic Kindle ereader + a much better tablet. This device is really the worst of both worlds.

First day i tried it, i thought it is not for me,as it didn't stop me from sweating. However, because i bought it i had to use it, right? (ha-ha) So, in a few days of using it, i think my body got used to it, or whatever happened,it just start working! It doesn't stop me from sweating completely, as it's not antidepressant, i suppose, but, it does a good job reducing sweating, eliminating nasty sweat smell and prevents appearance of wet armpits.So, I quite like it and it does better job than other deodorants i have tried. Only negative is that it doesn't last that long, a month the most (in my case at least), so it is a bit more expensive than other deodorants. However, it has lovely smell in addition to all above and the smell is not overpowering, as with some deodorants, so you still can use a perfume, and. . it is good for environment, so, it is win win for me🙂.

Freshness Unleashed: Wild Natural Refillable Deodorant – Vegan & Eco-Friendly
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2023Scent Name: Fresh Cotton & Sea SaltSize Name: 40 g (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
Let's talk pits – because, why not? I recently made the switch to Wild Natural Refillable Deodorant, and it's like my underarms have discovered a secret garden of freshness. I'm no deodorant expert, just someone who's tired of smelling like a chemistry lab.First off, the fact that it's refillable is a game-changer for the planet. No more contributing to the landfill with endless plastic waste – just pop in a refill cartridge, and you're saving the Earth one swipe at a time. Kudos, Wild, for being eco-conscious.The vegan and cruelty-free tag are like a cherry on top. It's good to know that my armpits are not a testing ground for anything other than smelling amazing. No animals harmed, and I get to smell like a botanical paradise – win-win.The scent range is a breath of fresh air, quite literally. From citrusy zing to calming lavender, there's a scent for every mood. It's like having a perfume collection, but for your underarms. The Wild scents are subtle yet effective, keeping me smelling fresh throughout the day.The application is smooth – no tugging, no sticky residue. It's like giving your underarms a spa treatment. The deodorant glides on effortlessly, and the packaging is sleek enough to toss in your bag without worrying about a cap popping off.The lasting power is impressive. I've put it through the stress test – gym sessions, long days at work, even a dance-off (don't ask) – and it held its ground. I appreciate a deodorant that keeps up with my antics.In conclusion, Wild Natural Refillable Deodorant is a breath of fresh air in the deodorant game. Vegan, eco-friendly, and a variety of scents to suit every vibe – what's not to love? If you're on the hunt for a deodorant that's as kind to your skin as it is to the planet, Wild is the way to go. Your pits will thank you, and so will Mother Earth.

Lovely smelling, gentle deodorant
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2023Scent Name: Variety PackSize Name: 40 g (Pack of 3)Verified Purchase
I love my wild refills. They’re more expensive than regular deodorant but in my opinion worth it. They’re gentle on my very sensitive skin, they smell great (vanilla has been the best so far) and they last me all day once applied. I love the reusable case designs, it’s a small step towards being a little bit greener in my everyday life. They’re super easy to swap out and do last a good while. My only two gripes with them are the fact you can’t use it until it’s completely empty, there’s always a little bit left, and sometimes the top layer of the stick dries out a little and when you apply it it sticks to your skin leaving behind a residue and sometimes marking my clothes if I haven’t realised it’s there. It does wash out though so really not the end of the world, I’ve found rubbing my finger on the top before applying has helped solve this problem for me, I certainly wouldn’t let it put me off

Great value, great for long thick hair, lovely shine
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2024Size Name: Pack of 1Verified Purchase
Amazing product. Straightened my long thick hair much quicker than my GHD due to the bigger plates. The argon oil infused plates meant I had such a great shine (which so many people commented on). The temp buttons are in an awkward place though  (where you hold the product) so your fingers keep changing the temp. My solution was to use it with button side turned into my palm direction. You get used to it. Really great value & much quicker & longer lasting results than my newest model GHD. I’d always recommend using the heat proof mat to rest it on & glove. Just for safety. Which I bought on here. But the glove isn’t a necessity. I would recommend this for long thick hair. And always use heat protector spray/product. Anything shoulder or above go for the slimmer one. A very good find.

I bought these to replace my wife's GHDs. At first i was skeptical that they would do a comparable job given they are significantly less however i couldn't have been more wrong. The feedback so far is that she loves them.They have  variable heat control so can have the temp lowered if needed for delicate hair, they heat up quickly and glide nicely through hair. The results are straighter hair which is shinier (due to the Keratin infused plates). The results are also lasting longer.Why pay £150+ for GHD when you can pick these up for £30

Love the phone.  Updated from a Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini which I'd had for a long time, so ready for something new.  Nice & fast to use, a clear & responsive screen with great colours.  Needed an update via wifi out of the box, then transfered almost everything from my old phone via the NFC function.  Happy overall with everything, just learning to use it now!  It has much more software than my old phone which needs sorting into useful & not.  The ONLY bugbear is that I don't seem to be able to move my icons around the screen like my old phone, by holding then moving.  It seems to have a very longwinded way of moving them around.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong? Also, I have 2 ringtones which were downloaded many years ago for my 2 favourite contacts which haven't transfered & I can't find which folder holds then in my old Samsung to send them across to the new one.  Overall, happy with my new toy...... now how to drive it?

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2018Colour: BlackStyle Name: Galaxy S7Verified Purchase
Supplied by HandyGlobal through Amazon.co.uk Market Place without a UK charger plug (£10 to buy one from Amazon!). The email receipt is in German.  The handset is excellent and hugely faster and more responsive than my old S3, also battery life seems much better so far (but it's not user replaceable).Two reservations - it is very slippery; I have invested in a gel case as I was really nervous of it slipping out of my hand (the S3 was the same) - the registration process on the Samsung website is incompetent to an astonishing degree! The Model Number is required to do anything and the model number on the sticker on the back and in Settings is incomplete so you can never complete online registration! I had to email for help and a very helpful reply from a Samsung employee advises that she has registered it for me, as she can find the model number from the Serial Number I supplied; why ever can't the website do that for us?

I was a little dubious about buying a refurbed phone, but I've been very impressed! I loved my S7, had it for 3 years and it only broke after a clumsy drop from a height, totally my fault. So even though there are newer phones out there, I really just wanted the same one again.I found this one and was a bit worried about what condition it might be in, but was comforted due to the 12 month guarantee. It arrived sooner than expected and in fantastic condition. You could not tell that it wasn't brand new.So so happy. Would 100% recommend. And I never usually write reviews on here! Haha!

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2017Colour: WhiteStyle Name: Galaxy S7Verified Purchase
This must of been the most disapointing purchase I've ever made in my life.I thought it would be nice to upgrade from my old Samsung S6 as I had it a few years so decided to order a S7.My last 3 phones were Samsung ones and have always being a reliable phone.Anyway my purchase of the S7 started well and the transfer of Phone data went smoothly.The next day the phone was frozen as I was out in town and I could not restart as it never got past the start up ""Samsung Galaxy S7"" screen. It took at least 3 hours before it decided to unfreeze.That evening did an operating system update hoping it would resolve the issue.The next day the phone froze yet again for a few hours, later in the evening and went through Samsung online helpline (who where very helpful) to try and run the phone in ""safe mode"" but it was freezing on that to, in the end of my ordeal they said its the hardware and will have to be sent back for inspection.I am very dissapointed that for such and expensive high grade phone it's totaly useless, this is the sort of thing I would expect from a cheap phone for £14.99 form the local supermarket not from a £425 one!!!!If I would give this 0 stars if the review allowed it.

Battery charging a disaster!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 June 2023Colour: BlackStyle Name: Galaxy S7Verified Purchase
Good phone but I have had great problems in charging it. The first one I had lasted eight months before the battery died and the phone was unusable. I contacted the seller through Amazon and, to their credit, they agreed to refund me, even though it was long past the 30-day deadline. I then bought the same model again as it suits my needs perfectly. However, this one started to display recharging problems in only three weeks. Charging is a hit-and-miss affair - sometimes it will charge fully, at other times not at all, even when left all night on charge. I shall give it a week more before deciding whether to return it. I contacted Samsung, who said that as the model was introduced in 2016, the batteries could well have degraded. Really? In that case they had no business in allowing dealers to sell these phones. Will not buy another if I do return it.

Samsung S7, quality crafted proper Smartphone.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 October 2016Colour: WhiteStyle Name: Galaxy S7Verified Purchase
Gorgeous crafted smartphone. There is nothing much to say that people will not already know so I just want to say a few minuses that are my opinion. The phone felt tall for me as I prefer the smaller phone and battery life varies everyday. Battery life is always subjective mainly due to what apps people use but somedays were good and somedays it felt like battery was going down quite fast.Else this phone has the lot and micro sd support is one of them. The audio through headphone is lots clear and dynamic compared o my Sony Z5 Compact and I like the way the white version shows all the sensors on the front whereas black hides them. Gorgeous screen fully flexible as Android is compared to crippled IOS there is basically nothing wrong with the S7.

Great Phone and Seller.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2021Colour: BlackStyle Name: Galaxy S7Verified Purchase
Bought this as a rather cheap replacement phone. It was advertised as 'acceptable condition' but it arrived almost brand new with only a very few minor scuffs on the side. For the price I paid I was very pleasantly surprised.Took a little longer to arrive than I hoped but it was very near Christmas when I ordered it, so willing to accept that it was probably out of the sellers control.Would buy from the seller again for sure.

Worth the hype
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 April 2024Verified Purchase
So, this fragrance has received a huge amount of attention on social media. Is it worth the hype? I’d say yes. It smells nice (reminds me of apple pie) and lasts for ages. The diffuser on mine seems to have a slight fault but I can work around that. It seems like the days of paying a small fortune for quality fragrances are numbered.

Nice fragrance for sweet scent lovers
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 March 2024Verified Purchase
Purchased this fragrance following the many reviews on social media. Most claim this smells similar to Angels Share by Killian. Upon review and reflection, this does NOT smell anything like Angels Share by Killian in my opinion. Maybe upon first application you get the similar boozy notes as you do with Angels Share by Killian but that’s about it. This is a very sweet fragrance, so if you like sweet gourmand fragrances, then you will enjoy this.In terms of season, this is a winter/spring fragrance as I can imagine 8n the summer months this would be quite cloying.The fragrance didn’t project well, nor did it last long on my skin. Appreciate this may not be the case with others who try it.Overall,  Khamrah is worth the money, the presentation is lovely, high end and the bottle is well made. Not bad for the price.

Great scent, I would class it as a gourmond, longevity is very impressive I got easily 8 + hours, also decent projection and a good compliment getter.The notes I picked up on the most would be apple, and vanilla with a hint of cinnamon. I haven’t personally smelt angel share so I’m not sure if a comparison can be drawn.The packaging is very impressive and high quality.

It is a very nice fragrance with cinnamon at the centre but dosen't last long, maximum I have managed with 3 to 4 sprays is few hours. Dont know what I am doing wrong or what product I have received as quite few people are saying it lasts. Bottle and presentation is lovely but if the fragrance dosen't last then all these are pointless. Velvet Oud I have also bought from this company which is quite strong and costs less but it lasts well over 6 hours.

These stickers smell nice if you put them up to your nose, but when stuck on the top you can't even smell them. My daughter has ended up wearing them on her sleeve so she can put it to her nose to have a sniff when she is anxious.Sadly they don't help at all. A weak lavender aromatherapy smell,  may as well just use an aromatherapy roller ball type or body spray - a lot cheaper.

I've used them today and actually managed to walk on my leg better. I'm not saying I don't need surgery now, but I can now live without the horrendous pain. This is my honest review. It's not even placebo, because even my brain can't hide the horrendous pain I've been in prior to using these. Give them a try. Nothing much to lose!

Smashing the competition
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 October 2010Verified Purchase
This Game rocks. After reading some of the negative reviews I am shocked.People say this isn't a traditional beat em up. In my opinion thats a good point not a bad one. It offers a unique way of defeating your enemies. You hit your opponents and deal enough damage to smash them off the level. Also as to people complaining its too manic, thats kind of the point.This has great graphics, a wonderful array of characters and many differentways to play.The only bad point in my opinion is the subspace emisery mode is a little tedious and you do need to complete this to unlock all the extras.Seriously though this Game is so much fun, the first Smash Bros Game and Melee for the Game cube were so innovative and this version adds more to the Brawl.If you like games with a difference, want a new take on the aging fighting genre or just want to see Mario beat the hell out of Solid Snake and Sonic buy this Game. You won't be sorry.

Still the best multiplayer out there!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 July 2008Verified Purchase
I'll address this review to people who aren't too familiar with Smash Bros, since those who are, probably already have the game and don't need any convincing from me.Basically this is a very unique fighter since instead of walking around, trying to depleat each other's health bars (yawn), you jump around building up you opponents' damage. The aim is to knock your opponent off the screen using a huge variety of moves and techniques, and the more damage they have, the further they fly. Of course the game is packed with old and new Nintendo characters, plus Solid Snake and Sonic. The game is  very wacky and Japanese-y so don't expect it to make a whole lot of sense.SINGLE PLAYER- The thing to remember is that this is a multiplayer game. Single player is really there to brush up on your skills for your next multiplayer match. Of course single player is good fun- but not the key focus of the game. The new Adventure mode (subspace emissary) is so-so. You play through arcade-style levels. Whilst it's cool seeing your favourite characters from different games interact, it's a shame that the levels aren't set in the characters' games (levels and most enemies are just unique ""Smash bros"" ones). All this is still a great addition for old Nintendo fans, but definitely not the primary reason for buying the game.ONLINE- You can play against friends online, with loads of options, but so far I have only tried random matchmaking. Two problems I found with this was: Long waiting time to connect to other players, and some laggy slowed-down play. As I understand, however , playing friends online is a much better experience.NINTENDO NOSTALGIA- This game is packed with it. All I need to point out in this category is: If you don't know much about Nintendo and it's past games, a lot of the game's elements will be lost on you. But that's not to say you won't enjoy it.So overall I'd highly reccommed this game, just as long as you know what you're getting. People who buy this based on hype alone with no understanding of what the game's about may fail to grasp the nature of it (which is always the case when someone has a negative opinion of it). But if you have a wii, a few mates (if they're Nintendo fans that's even better), and a touch of competitiveness, then chances are that you'll be enjoying this for years to come.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 August 2008Verified Purchase
Gosh, I 've bought so many Wii games recently and this has got to be the cream of the crop.1.)Think of it as Mortal Combat, but with all the characters you grew up playing on Nintendo.2.)It has a lots of extras, like the mini games, and creating your on play stages. It has also good training levels as well.3.)Be aware that the games ""does not use Wii motion"" so the controlling is pretty much like past generation gaming. ie gamecube.4.) Good graphic, excellent game play and some of the best stories line will keep you hooked for hours.I think overall this will appeal to the more hardcore players, if you where looking for a wii workout type of game, then this is not for you.

Excellent game - watch out for compatibility issues on older Wiis
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 October 2011Verified Purchase
This game had a 9 year old boy completely enthralled, however our Wii is a very early one and initially we thought the disk was faulty.  It does work eventually but it has to be inserted multiple times until it does.  His friend's Wii which is around 18 months old has it working 1st time every time.  If you Google it you will find it is a known issue that apparently can be fixed by sending your Wii back to Nintendo however we are not going to bother and will live with it until maybe a Wii 2 next year!

I was however a bit concerned by the price. £40+ to pay upfront seemed like a lot when you are used to paying out around £5 per week. Anyway I took the plunged and brought our last box on the 30th August which it lasted around 29 weeks, which worked out at only £1.62 a week on toliet paper. Which for our household of 4 has been a huge saving. Obviously I've brought them again and this time managed to get the box of 48 on offer for £3 so they will cost me even less this time.

Used to buy these directly from 'Who gives a crap' on subscription but often ended up with more than we needed and kept having to push back orders. Ordering off Amazon works well for us. Like the company as they pour some of their profits into providing toilets for those without them. Does what it needs to and the rolls last longer than other brands, even in our busy household.

Plastic-free toilet roll
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2019Size Name: 24 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I love that these are plastic free - the main reason I bought them, and think the packaging and ethos of the company is great. The rolls are long and good value for money so definitely a better option than the standard supermarket brands.  I chose the recycled version as I'm not completely convinced that using bamboo transported all the way from China is more sustainable than using paper from managed European forests.  The same bleaching chemicals are used and the carbon footprint and ecological impact can't be great, especially  if forests are cleared to make way for bamboo plantations.  I thought the recycled version would be more environmentally friendly, although I would prefer if it wasn't bleached.  Unfortunately the paper just completely disintegrates when I use it and I end up having to pick bits of toilet paper off my privates.  Other recycled toilet paper I have used has not disintegrated this badly so I really wish you could make it a bit stronger!  If you could I would have definitely given this five stars.

Do not buy - you will be disappointed (or worse)!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2023Size Name: 48 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
Bought this mostly for the novelty value, and thought all the 5-star reviews meant it can't be too bad - what a mistake!Now trying to work through a box of this rubbish, while alternating with rolls of a much better and softer brand.Don't be fooled into thinking you get good value with a longer 400-sheet roll - the sheets are tiny compared to any other paper I've used (only 10cm long compared to 12.5cm on leading brands), and this is so extremely thin you end up using easily twice as much as normal.  This is 3-ply of the thinnest layers of paper you could find, and better-known 2-ply is much thicker, softer and stronger than this.It shreds and rips in all directions when trying to pull off a length, it crumbles and falls apart at the slightest bit of moisture, making it even more wasteful and messy to use.  You are likely to get quite frustrated using this, and the lack of comfort in using it may make you want to throw it away for health reasons!This also works out expensive - ""SOFT, STRONG, TWICE AS LONG"" is absolute nonsense..  It is far from Soft or Strong, and better quality rolls of 190 or 200 proper size sheets will last longer when you're not having to waste loads.Not too convinced on the ""eco-friendly"" points either.. It may be ""100% recycled"", but it's made and shipped from the other side of the world, probably with waster paper shipped to China from all over the world.  Much better products are actually made in UK or EU and probably being more responsible about environmental issues.Ignore the hype on this product, read the low reviews, and don't go by the number of 5-star reviews which mostly don't say much about quality.  Save yourself some frustration and soreness!  Do not buy!

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2015Colour Name: RedStyle Name: 2 x 3 PrinterVerified Purchase
Bought as a present for my wife. Since our baby was born her phone has become filled with photos and I didn't want them to remain stuck there forever. This is a brilliant little solution. The printer itself is a bit bigger than a boxed deck of cards. Slightly shorter but wider than an iPhone and about twice as thick. It's charged via a usb and you fill it with packs of paper, 10 sheets at a time. These are not mega cheap but the best I found was 7 packs of 10 for £9.When charged you just turn the printer on (there is only 1 button on the printer) and use the Polaroid ZIP app to make and send your photo. The app allows you to select single pics or make a collage style photo. The app also allows for some editing like crop, rotate, brightness and contrast, colour balance as well as Instagram-style filters (retro, black and white, cool, sepia, etc).The pics take about 20 seconds to print and work via some special chemicals and heat to define the colours rather than ink or toner.We've been able to pair 2 iPhones to it via bluetooth and I've just had to select it again from my devices as it was showing but not connected.All in all this will be perfect for adding small pics to thank you cards, sticking into her baby book (they are self adhesive peel and stick) and just having as printed photos. The photos are pretty small 2x3 inches (5x7.7cm) but do the job for what we want. Think there's a larger 3x5 version on the way but that's only from looking at the paper stock. There's also a ZINK printer that uses a roll of this type of paper but that's around £200.

Beautiful photo printer!So cute, and although dimensions were expected, I still wasn't prepared for just how compact it is!Actual blue isn't quite as vibrant as shown; it's a bit dull and not quite glossy.My daughter had the black coloured version and that one is glossy and as seen in other pictures.Very easy to use, though having more than one device connected at once can cause a few problems - this is easily overcome by taking to the other people who are connected and taking turns to send and print! (We got this at Christmas and we were all trying to send images at the same time!).Highly recommended.Oh, be sure to keep the blue card that comes with the photo paper as you will then be able to use the cheaper Pogo paper from Polaroid earlier edition printers!This is updated after receiving this item.I now have used 3 of these printers, and it seems the print quality is not consistent.One I've sent back because the prints are a few shades darker than expected and shown on phone.If I only had encountered one printer, I would not have known this, although i was not happy with the print from the defective one anyway as it was too dark.I'd recommend asking for a replacement if you feel the print is not as good as it should be.I am very happy with the prints from other machines as they are crisp and bright as expected.This printer can deliver, so if it doesn't for you, the device could be faulty.

For my intended use, it may perhaps suffice but it could certainly be better.Positives:- Small physical size (very)- Great Portability- Rechargable unremovable battery (unlike closest competitor). Could also be a negative for some- Small images (wallet size - can be seen as good and bad)- Quick to print (despite other reviews the speed isn't bad)- Good accompanying app (could be improved - see negatives)Negatives:- The image size would be nicer if it was a bit bigger (for me personally).- The clarity/sharpness of the prints isn't great, though for what the Polaroid Zip is, perhaps I'm asking too much of it (it's more of a fun, consumer product than a pro printer after-all).- The colour reproduction is off, producing a magenta tinge to images (even black and whites come out with a red/magenta tinge, and even also a little blue).- The App: When resizing images in the 'edit image' portion, unfortunately there is no way of centering the image (either on the horizontal or vertical axis (a method similar to that of Microsoft words image positioning would be ideal)- The battery isn't removable, so if you're in the wild with no mains you cannot remove it and put in another precharged battery like you can with the Zips closest competitor. What you can however do is print and charge at the same time, so try a battery pack for charging phones/laptops etc (i.e search Anker on Amazon).The Polaroid Zip instant printer isn't a bad product. The ease of use and portability makes it a superb product, it is however let down by its image quality (though only slightly). My review is therefore a 4* and not 5*.

A great little printer, fun to use it. Perfect for my teenage daughter as she could just customise her pictures that was shoot on her phone and could share them or add them to her photo scrapbook. Works seamlessly with any device, it was easy to pair. If you look around you also will be able to find some good deal on the photo paper. Originally purchased the camera version of this polaroid, but returned it as picture quality was not great with it. This printer the same size as the camera, but at least you are able to edit your pics on your phone and print it the way you like it. Oh, and I recommend to buy a small hard case as well here on amazon, so the cable for charging, the spare papers, the printed photos could be safely stored in one place. Highly recommended little printer, fun to use it on vacations or on birthday parties. My daughter is very happy with it.

Versatile, Can Use In Tesla
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 July 2023Style Name: Luna ControllerVerified Purchase
If you have prime, you get 5 free games a month on Amazon Luna Subscription or pay 9.99 and get a larger selection plus also stream a majority of Ubisoft games that you may own. By far the best quality and reliability streaming service of which there are not many around.The controller itself is a good size and fairly comfortable with excellent grips, doesnt slide in the hands like xbox or ps. It is easy to put into bluetooth pairing mode and works well but the trick up its sleeve is the awesome inbuilt wifi receiver, its game changing! The amazon luna service is available as an app or web page on pretty much any device, if it can stream the web page the controller automatically connects to it once turned on its brilliant. On your PC, on your tablet, on your TV, on your Tesla.Tesla made it awkward to connect a controller to its newer cars until bluetooth support becomes available, but stream Amazon Luna on the web browser in the car and fire up the controller and away you go!Cons: Only few gripes are buttons are a bit firm to press, at the moment there is no replacement battery charger pack (just use a AA battery plug in charger) and the price. Its not cheap but to be fair its like two controllers in one, you may never need anything else and the technology is unique and just works out the box and you can wait for an Amazon sale. One controller I ordered did not work correctly but another positive of this Amazon controller is the usual Amazon service applies meaning replacement sent out asap 👌

A decent controller that is focussed on connectivity wherever you play.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2023Style Name: Luna ControllerVerified Purchase
This sits up there with the controllers you get with a PS5 or an Xbox and feels weighty in the hand and has a decent tactile feel on its buttons. It is not as good as the dual sense (PS5) , but neither is the Xbox controller. The buttons (A,B,X,Y) are decent and have good push back, the triggers are firm and have a good resistance, the middle buttons (Select etc) are not quite as nicer feel in the hand but i do like the way the middle (Connect or LUNA button) is fully integrated into the controller and does not stand out, im not really a fan of this on the new Xbox Series controller and like the older iteration in the Xbox One. I also like the way the joysticks feel, they are not too loose and have a good rubber, at least currently. There is a textured plastic on the grips which is nice but not quite as good as the new Xbox Series controller.If you already have a controller on the other two platforms it may not be worth getting this but where the LUNA controller comes into its own is the connectivity - it truly feels seamless (From my MacBook to my iPad and then to my FireStick. It comes up with a pop up saying its playing via cloud and just works - almost reminiscent of apple products. It doesn’t replace other controllers but may sit in your portfolio if you are serious about gaming or experiencing what the developers want you to on the platform. As a note the bluetooth works well with the other controllers but you have top connect each time if you move where you are playing, a minor annoyance which may be worth noting.From me the latency is quite important and this feel extremely responsive, i have tried this with an average or 145mb/s internet and 20-40mb/s and they both work well. There was a few pop ups about the internet on the slower and not as constant internet but it didn’t stop me playing.For me this has found a place in my bag, as i travel often, as it works well and i have faith in the service - not to mention that there is quite a large launch library and 4 free games per month, what streaming service gives you that for simply being a member?I recommend this controller but do not expect it to be better than your premium console controller. If you want to get into cloud gaming this is a very good start (Better than the stadia controller, but lets not get into that catastrophe or a platform), if you care about ease, connectivity and simply working this works well!

Great - But Too Expensive
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2024Style Name: Luna ControllerVerified Purchase
Firstly, the controller itself works perfectly with regular PC games, it's easy to connect to your PC and it works well.Ergonomically, the controller is comfortble to grip, and it feels like a premium X-Box controller (better quality than X-Box controllers)I think it is overpriced however. £60 is retal price for a proper PS5 Dualsense controller.The ""LUNA"" gaming service is pretty rubbish too, there aren't many games worth playing. Lego Fortnite is probably the only game on LUNA anyone has ever heard of.The games are very laggy, the resolution quality is poor, the audio quality is poor, and the controller continually disconnects from the service.Overall this is a great controller to use for regular PC gaming, but I don't recommend the Amazon ""LUNA"" cloud gaming service, purely because of the lack of ""good"" games and the constant connection issues.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2023Style Name: Luna ControllerVerified Purchase
This works perfectly and is a great addition to amazon Luna.  Its built for the amazon cloud network so there is no problems at all.  Its very responsive when playing games.The controller itself fits nicely in the hand with all the buttons easy to reach.  The build quality is Solid.  The benefit of this controller is that you can connect via amazon's WIFI or Bluetooth depending on what you play it on.I took it with me on holiday and for some reason could not connect via the WIFI provided so I connected via Bluetooth and its work just as well.  And that was on the Amazon Fire tablet 11 max.  Worked beautifully.  Unfortunately  the WIFI wasn't that good when playing games, so I had to abandon my gaming.But overall if you want a Amazon Cloud gaming experience at its full, then get this controller.

Brilliant and well worth the high price.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2024Style Name: Luna ControllerVerified Purchase
Works really well with FireTV stick. Also works to play Luna games on my MacBook Air M1 by connecting directly to Luna through Wi-Fi. The price is a bit steep but the extra features make this worthwhile.A slight negative is that this uses AA batteries (but can be played plugged into a usb charger) and that feels a bit backward in 2024.

Another great Flash product! This and the Flash Dust Magnet make my housework a lot easier. This mop breezes through cleaning my wooden floors and is very effective with minimum effort.WHAT I LIKE -- the simplicity of the design having the liquid integrated into the mop. At the touch of a button the cleaning liquid is sprayed out from the front of the mop onto the surface to be cleaned- the replaceable mop pads are so easy to get on and off and really do pick up the dirt with ease- the shape of the handle and the length of the mop make this easy to manoeuvre and is comfortable to use- the starter kit contains everything you need, the mop, plenty of pads, the cleaning liquid, the batteries to power the sprayer- very easy to assemble- pads last a good while, i get 3 kitchen floor cleans between replacement pads but others may want to replace after each floor cleanWHAT I DONT LIKE -- i sometimes accidentally press the spray button when I don’t want to because of the location on the handle- the cleaning fluid doesn’t have much of a fragrance, I’d prefer it to smell more- if you can get this for less than £20 then you have a bargain

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 August 2023Colour Name: GraphiteSize Name: 44mmStyle Name: LTE 4GPattern Name: Watch OnlyVerified Purchase
I got this to replace a first-gen Watch Active. The principle’s the same, but I’m very pleased with what a big upgrade step it’s proving to be.It’s only slightly larger in physical size, but because the screen reaches far closer to the bezel, the difference in screen size is phenomenal. The old Active watch’s screen was a good quality, this one is visibly better, with incredibly crisp lines and some beautiful line rendering. It’s a gorgeous display that even looks good displaying photos you’ve taken on your phone.Functionally, again I’m amazed at how much of a jump up it is. The switch from Tizen to WearOS makes a big difference. WearOS is intuitively much closer to being the same experience as on a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. The watch feels like a natural extension to the phone. Despite the different OS, set-up was really quick and within a couple of minutes of unboxing it I had it up and running.The customisation is great. By fiddling with the settings for the ‘complications’ (the widgets visible on your watch display) you can easily set it up with the quickest possible shortcuts to the apps or controls that you use most often- in my case, Strava for jogging and then music controls. The rotating action for adjusting your music volume is an example of a neat simple control that this phone just gets absolutely right.Touch sensitivity is good, and it really picks up well on which part of the screen I’m aiming for. Apps like Strava work much better than on my old phone. The extra screen size allows for more information to be shown with greater legibility.The health features are almost sci-fi and I’m only beginning to scratch the surface of them. The array of sensors included is impressive. The numbers it seems to come out with all seem reassuringly plausible- for example there is a strong correlation between how fast it feels like my heart is pumping, and what the watch tells me my heart rate is.Since the screen is so much bigger than my previous watch, with more sensors being used, I expected the battery life to be worse but it’s not. It’s pretty much the same. On a typical day I’m using about 20% of the battery capacity, or if I’ve been hammering it a bit with exercises, I’ve hit 30% usage in a day. That’s more than enough for a long weekend. A plus is that it uses the same charging base as my previous watch, which now means I can use the old one as a spare.One thing I knew I would change is the strap. There’s nothing wrong with the silicone strap it comes with, but because this watch uses a standard watch strap size, it means you can fit any one of hundreds of different watch straps to this watch, for personalisation and for comfort. I happen to prefer fabric watch straps, so that’s what I’ve fitted.This watch is top-of-the-range in a lot of different ways and I’m really enjoying it.

First impressions, great. As always with Samsung, the packaging and presentation is top notch. I've not had a Samsung watch before but always used their phones so I expected it to be user friendly and it really is even though I'm certain I haven't fully experienced all it can do yet! I love the look of it and the range of faces you can choose from. It's sleek and stylish looking. And can be as subtle or as lary as you choose! It fits nicely. The band feels like quality. Connecting was simple. I particularly love the sleep tracker. As a chronic insomniac it's really helping me track and improve my sleep timings, quality and general knowledge. The fitness tracker is fantastic. It comes with all the bells and whistles you'd need. It even measures stress, BP, ECG etc which is great and beneficial and actively encourages you to breathe deeply and slow down... or to get up and move if you're having a lazy / computer day. Replying to messages and receiving calls works very well. I didn't even know it had a mic/speaker until my first facetime when I realised I was talking via my watch and not my phone. My only gripe would be battery length. Initially it didn't even last one day. I'm not sure if that's normal. But I'm getting into a habit of when to give it a boost charge and that's working out well as it actually charges at lightening speed so it's no huge issue. There's loads more to say and I'll add to this once I've had it longer and explored more. For now, it's a big win.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 August 2020Verified Purchase
Set in 13th century Japan, the island of Tsushima is the first to face the Mongol invasion. You play Jin Sakai - a young samurai of the House Sakai - on the front lines facing the Mongol hordes where your entire clan is wiped out with you the sole survivor apart from your uncle Shimura who is captured. Resolving to do whatever it takes to save protect Japan, liberate the island, and save your uncle, Jin is forced to set aside the honours and traditions of the samurai and wage a new kind of war against the enemy - that of the Ghost of Tsushima.Ghost of Tushima is an open world game where you can run, climb, swim, and ride through the vast grasslands, forests, mountains, and villages of the island of Tushima, in your quest to gather allies and repel the Mongol invaders.The game prompts unguided exploration of your environment and lacks a mini map to show you nearby points of interest, relying instead on the wind to direct you to your destination. The island is littered with all manner of points of interest, including hot springs that increase your health, quiet spots where you can contemplate your adventures and compose Haiku, survivor camps filled with traders who will upgrade your weapons (for a price) or offer useful information about local events and nearby missions, random encounters with roving bands of Mongol warriors, bandits or citizens in need, towns under siege, or enemy strongholds to be attacked.The playing area is huge with the island split up into three sections - each of which will corresponds to an associated chapter - and you're probably looking at well in excess of sixty hours of game play from start to finish if you make the effort to explore the environment to it's fullest.As a samurai your main weapon will be your katana. Initially you will start with only basic fast and heavy attacks but as the game proceeds you will learn new combinations and techniques to add to your arsenal, including several stances - each of which is more effective against a certain type of enemy. Combat usually involves facing a number of different enemies at once, such as swordsmen, spearmen, shield bearers, and ""brutes"", and so the key to success is to rapidly change between stances and use the most effective technique for the job at hand. You will also obtain charms that can be attached to your weapons, each of which will provide your character with a specific buff to your abilities.Despite your increasing skill with a blade it soon becomes apparent that winning this war is going to require a different kind of warrior, and to this end you also start to learn and adopt the tools and skills of the assassin, utilizing stealth, silent kills, and ""ghost"" weapons such as the kunai and black powder bomb to confuse and disorient your foes, stalking and striking from the shadows to remove your enemies with one swift blow. It reminded me a lot of the PSOne game Tenchu, for those old enough to remember that.In most scenarios you have a free choice regarding which approach you wish to adopt. Challenging foes directly is the honourable samurai way but may result in you being vastly outnumbered by your enemies, whilst sneaking through the shadows will allow you to avoid conflict or whittle enemy numbers down one by one but is an approach that leaves Jin conflicted and shamed.Samurai, Ghost skills, and stances have their own independent skill trees that can be upgraded each time you level up to unlock new abilities, so it is for you to decide what kind of warrior you wish to be as the story progresses. Also available are numerous upgrades for your weapons and armour, new costumes with distinct advantages, and legendary weapons and techniques that can be learned or obtained. Also important is your ""resolve"" - a limited but replenishing resource representing your will and tenacity that enables you to restore your health and unleash deadly attacks.In terms of controls the game has a lot in common with Witcher 3. Combat occurs over 360 degrees with you being able to strike out in any direction with a flick of the control stick and pressing the attack buttons, using a combination of swift strikes and heavy blows that break your opponents guard as well as blocking incoming attacks with your blade, dodging or rolling out of the way, using counter strikes, and using environmental hazards such as explosive barrels and hornets nests to distract or destroy your foes. It all makes for an extremely fluid and cinematic combat experience.There are lots of nice little touches to the game that really help to nail the genre, such as the ability to challenge opponents (think Red Dead Redemptions quick draw shoot outs but with blades!), duels where you face off against a single (usually powerful) opponent, and the ability to finish off downed enemies with a merciful killing blow.The graphics are excellent and the environment beautiful, and the game really shows that there's still some life left in the old console yet. You even have the option of playing the game in a grainy black and white filter akin to a traditional samurai movie. Effects, soundtrack, and voice acting are equally excellent and you have the choice of playing with an English translation or Japanese language with subtitles if you are looking for a more authentic experience.In terms of complaints there's not much to moan about. One issue is that there is no punishment or penalty for adopting the ""dishonourable"" ghost techniques or any reward for adopting the honourable samurai techniques even though Jin being conflicted by having to balance these two approaches is a persistent theme that runs throughout the game, although this doesn't really effect the quality of the story.Additionally, whilst there are a number of different costumes to be obtained that provide boosts to skills like archery, exploration, and stealth, as the majority of game play will involve sword play there's little incentive to explore these and the temptation is to stick with Samurai armours that boost things like your damage, health, and damage resistance. Also, whilst your sword can be upgraded, it is the only hand to hand weapon you will use throughout the game and it would have been nice to see some of the other weapons used by samurai in the game.Ghost of Tushima is a truly excellent and compelling gaming experience that's worth every penny and gets my highest recommendation.

This game is great. Not flawless, not perfect, but the niggles either come with the territory or are compensated for by other things.You play Jin Sakai, a samurai on the island of Tsushima.  You start the game by being defeated by the invading Mongol Army.  They kill all the other samurai and take your uncle hostage.  You have lost everything, you need to drive the invaders out and free Tsushima.And you're off.People talk a lot about how beautiful this game is.  And it does look good.  But the gold standard for beauty is obviously Red Dead Redemption 2.  It doesn't look as good as that.  But it looks better than most other games.  And it's very stylish.  It was designed to look like Kurosawa films, and it also has some of the very stylised looks of Hero or House of Flying Daggers.Gameplay is pretty standard for this sort of open world first person game.  You travel around the island carrying out missions.  En route you meet other characters, acquire gear, weapons and skills to improve your character. Sometimes you need to fight, sometimes you can sneak.The best thing about the game is the fighting.  This is sword fighting done brilliantly.  It is SO much fun.  You need to learn different stances, that basically equip you to fight different enemies.  So if you're facing swordsmen you do one thing, men with shields another, different again for spears and so on.  The first few hours you can pretty much get by without them but after that they are invaluable.The worst thing about the game is that it is quite repetitive.  After a while, there is a lot of ride round and do this and kill these bad guys and then do it again.  That does kind of come with the territory for a lot of these open world games, and personally, I don't mind it - i like the escapism - you might feel differently.Is this as good as God of War or RDR2?  No.  Is it very good indeed?  Yes.Keep an eye on the price.  I paid £30 on Amazon.  As I write this, it's £38.50 - it'll come down again soon, I am sure.

Beautiful world and good controls
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 April 2023Verified Purchase
I can see why this was well received and recommended. Environments are beautifully rendered, controls are responsive and no doubt it's a well crafted game.Missions are, on the whole, enjoyable enough. Yes they do become samey, clear out enemy camps/forts, rescue villagers, find this ..... Etc. But that's what these sort of games comprise of so that's fine by me.Only cons I can really point out are :1) and it is a flaw of many so-called open world games, in that it can become a bit drudgy traveling between missions. Yes you get fast travel after visiting a location but it's not always available.. then it's back on your horse for 5-10 min of galloping.2) you can't skip cut scenes !!??*** ... Why not I don't know, because they can be lengthy (and boring). It would have been nice to just get on with the action.But overall definitely worth playing.Recommended.

Yes some combat elements but they are very well done and the gameplay quality is outstanding. Gorgeous, smooth graphics makes my ps4 pro work very hard but man it looks next gen already, without the cost of getting a PS5! The story is genuinely engaging too. Like a good meal, games are all about separate elements working together as a cohesive experience. If all elements are top notch, you know the meal will be one to remember. This qualifies.

A Necessary Compromise: The Apple Lightning to 3.5mm Adapter
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 March 2024Verified Purchase
A Necessary Compromise: The Apple Lightning to 3.5mm AdapterIn an era of ever-slimmer devices, the Apple Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter serves as a pragmatic bridge between old and new technologies. For those who have embraced Apple's courageous move towards a wireless future, this unassuming dongle offers a vital lifeline, enabling the use of beloved wired headphones and audio equipment with the latest iPhones, iPads, and other Lightning-equipped devices.The adapter's compact size and simple plug-and-play functionality are undoubtedly convenient, allowing seamless connectivity with a vast array of 3.5mm audio devices, from vintage hi-fi systems to in-flight entertainment systems. However, its reliance on an additional accessory introduces the risk of misplacement or loss, potentially leading to frustration and added expense.While the adapter's versatility is commendable, its necessity also underscores Apple's controversial decision to remove the ubiquitous 3.5mm jack from their devices. This move, while promoting the adoption of wireless audio solutions, has left many users feeling forced to either adapt or abandon their existing audio gear.Ultimately, the Apple Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter is a practical solution for those navigating the transition to a wireless world. Its existence is a testament to Apple's design philosophy, which prioritizes sleekness and innovation over backward compatibility. Whether this adapter is a welcome convenience or a begrudging necessity will depend on individual users' preferences and their willingness to embrace the future of audio technology.

Wonderful sound now that initial connection issues resolved
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 July 2023Colour Name: MOMENTUM 4 Wireless - BlackStyle Name: SinglePattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
At first I felt these headphones were a mixed bag of tricks. I had read other reviewers had problems but having an earlier Sennheiser model and being familiar with their app I hoped for the best. However it took ages to get going. The on off control is tricky - to get a bluetooth connection the on button must be pressed till the lights flash rapidly. It's also hard to tell if it's really switched off. I then had a nightmare trying to connect to the Sennheiser App. My older set connects to both the app and bluetooth in seconds and works brilliantly but the Momentum 4 took me the best part of an hour plus another thirty minutes to install a firmware update. The problem I had, I think, was I initially tried connecting using a Fire10 tablet and the App just didn't like it. As a last attempt I tried the Fire Max 11 which worked at once. I then then downloaded the update by which time I had had enough electronics for one very stressful evening. The next morning I tried again with the Fire 10 and all was well. It seems the update resolved issues connecting to the App but unless you have another device or can find another way to update it's frustrating. Sennheiser do say their App is designed for phones primarily and do offer support with tablet related problems but in the event I didn't need to contact them. Since that first attempt I have had absolutely no problems with connection at all on any of the three devices I use.The Sennheiser sound is superb on the Momentum 4. I very much like the Sound Check system which helps to establish your personal presets by offering several sets of three settings - you select your preferred out of each set. I like a wide range of music including jazz, opera, rock, metal and in a few minutes was able to save settings for each genre. I had done this before with my older Sennheiser with great success but the sound on this newer set is brilliant. Unlike other reviewers I like the app. Once you find your way round it it's easy to use and the online manual is comprehensive and clearly written.There is only one button on the Momentum 4 much to my relief - and as I have said that one needs a bit of learning to operate effectively. Other controls are by touch and these work extremely well  - swipe up and down for volume, touch for stop start etc.  Unless you are committed to buttons this is a great improvement. The set is extremely comfortable with a neat flat appearance. I have noticed no clicking or creaking noises and no heat to my ears. It stays connected even when I move around a lot and stops as soon as removed from the head. The case is well designed with room for cables and guidance notes.I have used the set for about 40 hours so far, battery is still 50% charged. Noise Cancellation is easy to adjust on the app or the headphone touch control and seems good although I am in a quiet room. I haven't tried a phone connection as I am in an area where mobile reception is appalling.Overall I am very happy but more comprehensive guidance notes in the initial paperwork would have saved me a frustrating hour - but I say that about anything new!!If your primary wish is great sound at a medium price this is a wonderful buy. But be ready to take time to establish connections and don't miss the update.

I was going to return these then realised there was a problem with my bluetooth on a source.This was fixed and then I was given the full range of quality from these stunning headphones.The bluetooth connection is strong and holds on for dear life as you reach the edge of connectivity, then snaps back and continues playing when you wander back in range and for some reason?, you do not have to re-start a track as with some others.I am a dreadful audiophile and love my sounds to be available in top quality in all forms of reproduction.These do this soooooo well!, my old Sony xm3's are now in retirement.The Android app for these has allowed me to tune the sound profiles very well for different genre's ofmusic, as I like an eclectic mix from Infected mushroom via mellow jaz through to the most subtle of classical chamber music, to the full orchestral experience.We are are talking deep and wide soundstage here with great seperation of instruments and voices.Bonus feature time!,buy a decent wire for them and plug them in, they will then give your silly money wired headphones only ones a run for sound quality.10 out of 10.(ooh! they are comfy to wear for long  periods too, clamping force just right)

Awesome headphones…. but…
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 October 2023Colour Name: MOMENTUM 4 Wireless - BlackStyle Name: SinglePattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I have owned the Momentum 2’s for many years and love them. But, after the battery started to fail and took over 8hrs to charge I decided to upgrade. Here are my thoughts:Sound - Really good, but different to the 2’s. Took some time to get used to but I really like the sound now.Battery - Amazing. 60 hours is huge and makes such a difference not having to charge so regularly.Comfort - The 2’s were great but these are on another level. Can wear for hours on end without getting hot or ever feeling uncomfortable.Look - The 2’s looked amazing with the ivory colour. These look ok, but do not stand out. Build quality is excellent. No creaking on mine.Controls - I hate the touch controls and miss having a button to adjust the volume. If adjusting, then it is easy to activate a control. Changing the volume is hit and miss. I have turned touch controls off as they are too unreliable. It would be good to switch just some of the controls off and just have volume, or have the ability to change via the app. Maybe having less controls would help it work better.Connectivity - multiple devices works fine. I’ve had no issues but it niggles me that when you connect, you get a lovely voice that tells you it has connected, but when you connect a  Bluetooth device, a lady from Essex tells you it is connected. It is so wierd they use different voices for different announcements.All in all a great pair of headphones but I wish Sennheiser would address some minor niggles.

I bought these to be part of my halloween costume with the plan of putting one of them in a 20s cigarette holder. They are convincing fake cigarettes (although they do not produce smoke they look like they are burning inside and many people were convinced I brought a real one). As for putting them into the cigarette holder, I had to cut them and bend them a bit to get them in there but it worked. It is a fun and convincing product, ideal for fancy dress.

Really accurate and reliable!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2021Verified Purchase
Bought this as I wasn't sure what temperature of our room was at night but it felt like the temp was dropping. The groegg showed us that it was and we were able to fix it by setting the oil to come on. i had one of the wee paper temperature things but its very slow in comparison as the groegg picks up the change in temperature really quickly. We have a thermostat downstairs and when I opened the egg up in our living room was sitting at 24.1 Which is exactly what the temp read on the groegg. When I took it upstairs it dropped within a few minutes of being on. So it is very accurate. Very quick and easy to read. The lights are great. The blue lights wakes me up i find it hard to sleep with it on but I think thats great because it alerts me to the temperature being too cold. My newborn loves looking at the light.

Super clever idea
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 June 2016Verified Purchase
Super clever idea.! I came home with premature twins and one of them had warmth problems. As a result I always wanted to have a warm room and got a good telling off from my Health visitor who commented on how hot it was in the room every time she came to visit as this has a link to an increase in SIDS!I promptly tried all manner of temperature gauges as I felt I could not judge the room via my own body temperature (compounded by the fact that it was cold outside and with newborns I stayed inside so had none of that ' just walked into the house' feeling to compare it to).The egg is amazing and works by changing colour depending on the temperature. Bright red for warning its too hot, orange for warm, yellow for recommended baby room temperature and blue for too cold whilst also displaying the room temp. in the  digital display with a nice touch of a digital smiley or sad face symbol depending on the temperature suitability for the baby.It also makes a nice little ambient light feature n the corner (not really as  bright as something like a night light, which is fine as nice enough in itself as still gives a nice unobtrusive glow ). Love the colour idea as you don't have to spend your time pressed up to a digital display wondering what the temp. is and trying to remember what that optimal temperature for the baby is.I would recommend placing the egg right beside the cot /Moses basket as obviously on a windowsill / door facing plug socket it may give a different reading due to the circulation?Overall, innovative and clever idea!

Best temperature gadget I’ve ever used!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 December 2018Verified Purchase
I wanted one of these for my toddler but thought “oh it’s too expensive”.... ummm how wrong was I! I admittedly got it in the sale recently for my newborn, but it is brilliant! The glow is very soft and warm, the temperature is very easy to read both day & night as it has digital temperature as well as background colours for too cold, just right and too hot.The cable you get to plug it in is plenty long enough to keep it out of reach of little hands, and it’s actually really small so easy to pop anywhere in the room. I thought it was huge when I looked online!I’d definitely buy full price, I had a well known brand alternative (okay, I went through about 3 actually) that all worked in the bath as well as in rooms with my eldest daughter, and they were absolutely rubbish and didn’t even last until she was 6 months old. Totally recommend the gro egg!

An absolute must have
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2019Verified Purchase
A must have for a parent of a Newborn.I've found the product to be very accurate with the temperature readings. It must be noted that it needs to be placed away from radiators or windows to give an accurate reading for the ambient temperature of the room.The colour changing glow feature is very handy, as you can see at a glance if the temperature of the room is OK. Note that, in a light room, the yellow glow (the sign the temp is OK), is not particularly visible. However, when it goes blue, or orange, it becomes much more visible, which really is the most important time for it to be seen.In a dark room, the broduct gives a soft but noticeable glow. It will never replace a night light, that is not its intention.All round the product is almost spot on. The only let down, is the short cable. Which comes in at around 2 metres, which always sounds more than it is. This could present an issue when placing it, and that's the only reason this loses a star.

Not just for babies
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 August 2015Verified Purchase
A simple idea, wonderfully executed. As a thermometer, it works fine and seems to be very accurate. It's small enough to go anywhere (as long as there is a plug socket nearby - it is mains powered). For a babies room, the colour indicating the temperature range is a very useful way to check that the room is the right temperature at a glance. It's also bright enough to give reassurance as a night light. Don't worry about the photograph - it's not too bright.NHS advice is to keep babies rooms around 18°C at night. At this temperature, the thermometer glows yellow. If it turns blue, the temperature has dropped to 16°C and so is too cold. If it turns orange, the temperature has risen to 21°C and so is too hot.The whole thing looks good enough to be used in any room and I'll certainly be buying more for elsewhere in the house.

The only thing that actually works
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2023Style Name: 8 OzVerified Purchase
I've learned much more about fungus gnats (sciarid flies) than I ever wanted to. Where do they come from? In my case, they were flitting in through an open window. But they can hitch a ride on anything that has soil. I've even spotted them around potted live herbs sold at my supermarket.The adults are teeny little suckers, but they can swoop in and drop a load of gnat eggs in a second--producing over 200 eggs in their short 2-week adult lifespan. If any of those eggs end up in your houseplant soil, you have a houseplant infested with gnat larvae (like minuscule maggots). They wriggle around in the soil, ravenously eating anything they can: fungus obviously--as their name implies--but also the delicate root tips of your poor plant! When the larvae are well-fed and ready, they pupate into adults, and the Circle of Life starts all over again, much to your horror.I wasted time trying a long series of mild and ineffective home remedies. Cinnamon? These bugs just yawned at the stuff. Neem oil? It made my sitting room smell like burnt tires, but the gnats weren't bothered a bit. Drying out the soil? This may be the worst thing you can do; as soon as the fungus dries up, those hungry larvae move on to the next available food source: the juicy, tender plant roots.Don't waste time on any of that. Sticky tape and cinnamon are not going to help you in a war situation. This product is more like a biological warfare agent on the gnat battlefield. No, literally, it is a bag of dried plant bits soaked in bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies), which is lethal to the gnat larvae. Read the directions on the bag; they are very clear and easy to follow. You soak the dried plant bits in warm water to release and revive the bacteria; then, pour the resulting bacteria broth into the soil. The bacteria infects the larvae, and they die. This breaks the life cycle, so fewer adults will emerge from the soil after about a week. Don't let up, though; the adults still flying around are not affected by the bacteria, so they will still be busy dropping fresh batches of eggs. Hold your nerve and treat the soil again every week for about three or four weeks. By then, all the adults will have all died off (from old age), and any eggs left will have hatched, and any larvae will have become infected. It's not an instant solution by any means, but it is the only thing that actually works. I plan to keep treating my plants once a month or so from now on--the bacteria is harmless to the plants (and anything else that is not a gnat larvae), and you never know when one of those gnats might sneak in from outside or on a newly-bought plant friend.

First point: instructions are not the best. Measurements are US. As far as i figure for UK, 4 US tablespoons equals 60ml… and one US gallon is 3.8LThere is no guidance on how much mixed solution to apply. I soaked my pots, which is ironic as this is the last thing you need for FN!!Soooo… second packet later, many repottings,(PS- sterilise your compost first - i microwave mine on high !! And wash old compost off roots then soak bare roots in super strong mosquito bits solution before repotting) about the eighth week of ‘soaking’ the pots with solution and loads of sticky traps i might be winning. Either way i’m not applying any more or the plants will die if root rot. I think it helps, but i needed to use other measures too and keep reapplying!!!Will try nematodes next if the problem resurges

This ended the fungus gnat war of 2019-2022. Get it for this problem. I implore you!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 September 2022Style Name: 8 OzVerified Purchase
I was plagued with fungus gnats for the great war of 2019/21. They were everywhere in the house, buzzing around my head at night and in the day. At a glance, it didn't seem a big issue, but clearly, I underestimated the problem. I have a lot of house plants and thought I isolated the problem to a peace lily and aloe vera plant. In my naivety, I thought I could eradicate the problem by putting the plant in the cold, so out went the peace lily in the frost. The peace lily did not survive, but fungus gnats have natural antifreeze, so they carried on regardless.I read that Diatomaceous Earth would solve the issue, as the larvae like moist soil. I convinced myself this worked, but the odd gnat would still do a flyby. I then moved onto sticky yellow fly paper on all the plants, and it was then I became aware of the extent of the problem. The papers became covered in hundreds of gnats. Far more than I ever could have imagined. This reduced the issue, but the papers were still accruing more bodies daily.It was then I came across mosquito bites. It had been a long 18 months and I wasn't hopeful. I filled a watering can at the base with the pellets, and added water as directed. It gives off a foul sewer smell, but this smell doesn't travel, but is evident when you pour. After a couple of months of weekly watering, I noticed the reduction in gnats on the yellow paper, and this year I have yet to see a gnat. I declared the war over this summer. I have removed all the sticky yellow paper from the plant pots and have lived a gnat free existence since. The plants have thrived, I assume because the larvae are no longer eating the roots.I can heartily recommend this. I just wish someone had told me sooner, as I lost some good plants along the way.

Does not kill gnats
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2022Style Name: 8 OzVerified Purchase
I have biting gnats in my plants. They look like midges and maybe are and everyone tells me insects that bite only breed in water but I'm telling you they breed in my soil. Every time I pick up a plant they fly out of the soil and bite my hands. This product didn't work for them. I did everything correct, mixed with water and poured it in. Made top of soil super mouldy and these gnats seemed to thrive in it. Maybe I got a bad batch of BTI. Maybe the bacteria was dead on arrival. Or they don't work on these type of gnats. Should do though, these gnats lay eggs and have larvae and it's the larvae that eats the decomposed matter with the BTI soaked in to kill them. One thing I've found does help 90% is live beneficent nematodes : Steinernema Feltiae.

I kept seeing this advertised and that professional make up artist use this as a primer. I have seen no difference at all than any other primer. Theres nothing wrong with it, but Its not worth the price tag for the size of the tube. I does nothing special. I wont buy again and will go back to my cheaper product.

Never thought that this cheap on the shelf product would be so effective. My dermatologist recommended I use this as my skin is nearly 50 and has completely changed what it requires. Brilliant. I use in the night only but drier skin may need it morning and night. Wait a good 5 minutes before applying primer to let it soak right into the skin first.

Poor quality .. cheap and nasty.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2023Verified Purchase
Cheap and flimsy and way too sticky. Difficult to store due to it sticks to everything. Controls are cheap and overly simple like a kids toy. You set them and press stud the tiny box to the plastic then stick it on your body. It's too hard to get the patch flat so only parts of the thing vibrates (which tried several times and it worked on one side only. So I think mine was faulty. After its finished zinging (which does not fill me with confidence it was any good) its then a nightmare to prize n peel off the body. My stomach is fairly flat, just needed help with toning. It's useless and the glue like substance is disgusting and really is over gluey. I will be sending this back. Cheap and nasty sorty to be so blunt. This could have been an isolated issue and other packs may work better. Not suited to me at all and not worth just under £40.

Great game for age 10+, at least until you’ve seen all the cards a couple of times – 4½ stars
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 July 2022Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
We’re enjoying this. It’s easy to learn and generates a lot of amazement and laughter. It works well as a family game but only with older children. They say age 10+ on the box and I think that’s about right. While you don’t have to know the answers to the questions on the cards, you usually have to be able to make informed guesses.Some questions could be tackled by anyone, such as maximum number of mouse clicks in a second or minimum time to eat a pizza. Some are more difficult for 10-year-olds e.g. number of children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren the Queen has. So you may have to be a little selective with the cards used. Mind you, it may not be entirely suitable for older players either, or am I the only one who has no idea who Pharrell Williams might be?!There’s a lot more to the game than answering questions, but that’s the nub of it. The good news is that Big Potato Games is a UK company, so there isn’t a US bias in the questions. Except perhaps Pharrell Williams!The game seems well made and I was delighted to find there’s almost no plastic, only a sticker that doesn’t need to be in there. The box can be annoyingly difficult to slide open, but that’s my only gripe. There are only 100 cards, though, so if you play at all frequently you’ll start remembering the answers. For that reason alone, I’m going to be mean and deduct a star.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2023Colour Name: BlackPattern Name: Controller OnlyVerified Purchase
The official XBOX Elite controller Series 2 is a high-quality, top-tier controller. Aimed at the hardcore gamer, it actually is also very handy solution for gamers (such as myself) with limited hand mobility or other hand issues, thanks to its back paddles.The controller is heavier than the default XBOX controllers and has a more sturdy construction including metal back plate and triggers and special rubber grips. Unlike the standard controller it is supplied with the controller itself, a built-in battery and charging dock, a lovely solid hard transport case, four metal back paddles, six stick options , and thumbstick adjustment tool, two D-pad options and a USB-C charging cable.The sticks, paddles and D-pad are attached magnetically and are simple to swap out. The sticks offer a choice of lengths and grip textures.Please note the standard controller and set is black as pictured on the product images; my photos are of my custom XBOX Design Lab Series 2 Elite controller which was the only one I have to hand right now.The back paddles offer all sorts of options to you as they can be assigned in the XBOX Accessory settings dashboard to duplicate any of the other functions of the controller, and can also be given a second ""shift"" function. They sit exactly where you need them to be, and are easily accessible. Personally I set them as the A. B, X and Y buttons so that I can do whatever the buttons are set to do in the game without taking my hands off the thumbstick - great for fast twitch-shooters!The other advantage to having paddles replace the face buttons, I found, is that it means I can continue to play games despite finding using the face buttons difficult. I can suffer severe pain when repeatedly pressing the face buttons in long gameplay sessions, and this was making gaming almost impossible for me. Now, being able to easily access A. B, X and Y on the paddles means I can enjoy my Xbox again with no pain or discomfort. I would suggest this may be helpful for many gamers who find the face buttons tricky to easily use but can comfortably grip the controller as designed. You can of course assign pretty much ANY function to the paddles.The adjustment tool allows you to tighten or loosen the sticks very simply, just how you like.The charger dock can be used from within the case through the hole on the back of the case, or can be used outside of the case. It can be hooked up to your console or any device with a powered USB slot. It is optional;  the controller can also be directly connected to your XBOX without the dock.The controller offers massive flexibility so that you can set it up just as you like. Not only can you choose the hardware and adjust stick tension, you can also use the small switches on the back to adjust the trigger pull distance. You will also find great in-depth settings within the Accessories option in the XBOX settings, where you can set button assignments, dead zones, stick adjustments and more.Lastly, you can also use the controller settings on your XBOX to save up to three different profiles, which can be swapped between with the button below the guide button on the controller. This allows you to save specific button layouts and settings for individual games or types of game and switch on the fly.I have used a number of Series 2 Elites for several years each now and at no time have encountered stick drift, sticky buttons, peeling grips or any other issue that the older Series 1 controllers were prone to. They all still work perfectly and I find them much more durable, more comfortable overall  than the standard controllers, with a nice heft and feel of quality, and I find the paddles indispensable to the point that I cannot now use a controller without them.The only negative I can think of is that cleaning the inevitable hand-jam off the textured rubber grips is a massive pain in the rear because BOY does that crissy-crossy texture refuse to give it up without a fight. And don't doubt that no matter how fastidious you are keeping your hands clean, you'll need to do it eventually!These are not cheap; but are by far the best controller you will ever use, IMHO.

Amazing controller, if a tad pricey
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2023Colour Name: BlackPattern Name: Controller OnlyVerified Purchase
I've had this for a little over a year at this point, probably got over 1000 hours of use out of it across various games. Its responsive, well built, feels good in my hands and the back paddles have improved my gaming experience a lot. The adaptive triggers are also fantastic, allowing for snappy digital like presses for shooters and analog pressure sensitive control for fine adjustments in driving/racing games.However, I am experiencing some inputs not registering (unsure whether thats software or hardware). No stick drift for me, but I rarely every have drift problems with any controllers so dont take my experience as gospel. And god forbid you drop this damn thing and have both sticks and the D-pad ping off under furniture. Also kinda sucks that you cant remap the paddles to alt functions or macros without 3rd party software, but thats a very gamer problem.Overall, very good controller, just a bit on the expensive side if you're prone to breaking things.

Buyer Beware - Faulty Left Thumb Stick
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2024Colour Name: BlackPattern Name: Controller OnlyVerified Purchase
So I have now bought 2 units , only to return both.The controller is wonderful. The build and feel is impressive. Has such a nice weight and feels extremely comfortable in your hands. Such a shame the design of the thumb sticks is so so poor.On both units, both left thumb sticks do not depress properly to engage a run whilst playing Fortnite.It’s the only game I play, and to be able to run away at an instant is crucial.So having faulty or poorly designed thumb sticks is not great. Very poor considering this controller is way above £120 in value.After purchasing and experiencing this issue, I looked online and here on Amazon. Many many reviews and issues with the SAME problem. A bad & not working left thumb stick. It may be both sticks, but you only use one for running in Fortnite.Online going back years, this issue was logged at Microsoft. So they haven’t addressed it.Such a shame, as they could have taken my money for this beautiful feeling piece of kit. Unfortunately I have sent them back for refunds.

Leaving this review after 4 years of purchase, 2 actual years of use. Feels premium, great in your hands, customisable, four mappable paddles, excellent gaming experience, not a big fan of the metal buttons, though, the texture feels odd to me and I couldn't find any plastic replacements anywhere. Only real downside, and it seems I'm not the only one, is that at some point one face button and one shoulder button stopped working correctly, meaning I had to extra press for them to trigger, if they triggered at all. I still think it's great value for money but I'd wait for it to be discounted.

I'm a gamer and video editor and playing PC games with others online and talking to them with this microphone is so much better than my older one, the sound quality is so good that people I regularly play with immediately noticed the difference and asked if I'm using a new microphone.The Blue Snowball is a great device overall and I recommend it if you're looking for something that's reasonably priced and want a decent microphone. Its very simple to use, its a USB plug & play device so just stick it into your PC and its done and works within seconds. The sound quality is much better than a typical headset microphone, it also has a 3 leg stand so it holds up by itself on any flat surface.The big benefit for me about the Snowball is that it seems to pick up sound so pristinely even when placed quite far away. I often have it slightly away from me on my desk and have never been told I am hard to hear. Another great point is that whenever I'm clicking my mouse or typing on my keyboard you can't seem to hear the noise this makes, that's so useful for a video editor such as myselfIts odd that such an amazing priced microphone with great quality that it doesn't come with any kind of mute button, if you want to quickly mute the microphone you have to manually unplug it on go into the settings on your PC and mute there, its a minor convenience for me as I don't mind that at all but for others it might be a central issue. Other than that this is a top-notch microphone and recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to spend £100 on a professional microphone.

Looks and sounds fantastic for this super cheap price - very happy with my snowball
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 August 2015Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
I've used a few different USB condenser style microphones I the past including some from Samson and had never had much luck. The blue microphone was a product that I bought for a class I was teaching in school. I bought a couple of them for my students to carry out a podcasting class, mainly due to the price of the microphone and some good reviews I had read. The microphone comes in a well packaged box complete with a nice screw on stand and a high quality USB lead as well as instructions. You probably won't need the Instructions though as its so simple to plug it and and play straight out of the box. I used mine with a MacBook Pro retina, IMac and also an older MacBook Air. The microphone worked straight away with all the devices using GarageBand and Logic Pro.  The mono recordings are fantastic and clear with a decent amount of depth to them. We used vocals only for our project and when used in the right environment I.e somewhere you can dampen Natural reflections and echo the microphone performs to an outstanding level for the price. I have used this for a radio showreel for an FM radio station. The showreel sounded clear and vibrant when used with a pop shield (purchased on Amazon for a few pounds) and I got the job. So it can't be all that bad.The design of the microphone is a little plastic in parts and can feel a tad bit cheap in parts but not overly cheap. Bare in mind the price and the that fact that it is made of plastic and not trying to be metal or any other material. It looks modern and classy and looks awesome next to apple products (apple have been selling these microphones for years and they were happy with them). The small but stable stand is cool with an aluminium look finish and over all I'm really happy with what I got for the price.

Good value
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 April 2021Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
This round microphone (about the size of a grapefruit) is neat & well made,  and comes with USB lead around 6ft long (around 1.5 metres)  Plugging it into a USB port on your PC in Windows 10 installs software drivers and is recognised in Device settings on your PC.  Recording sound quality is good and clear, though on my PC the volume level is fairly low, so the recording level in Sound settings has to be set to maximum if you then have it placed around 1ft from voice source.  My only other comment would be that whilst the miniature tripod stand is useful its a shame you can't adjust the angle the microphone faces - its fixed at straight ahead.  It does work with Logitec Logi video software and shows in Microphone options and also in Zoom software. The apparent low output via USB in Windows 10 can be solved by installing free software ""Equalizer APO and the associated software Peace GUI""  which then allows change of level from microphone.

This microphone is a great choice for a beginner
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 July 2018Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
This microphone is a great choice for a beginner, who doesn't want any complicated setup. You simply plug in the microphone, and it works.In terms of audio quality, it's extremely good. I've not tested it in comparison to the Blue Yeti, but the difference is very small; the Blue Snowball iCE sounds slightly less like a normal sounding person than the Blue Yeti does, but in its own way, it actually has a deeper, more bassy, richer quality. Most people will not hear the difference unless explicitly comparing the two.There are only two parts which did sadden me. The first was the lack of a mute button. This can be extremely useful in some cases; without this, one must resort to muting via software. The second problem is that the stand they provide is pretty small. It will work if you're talking via Skype, and to some extent, via gaming; but it definitely won't come near to your mouth at all. It is probably smaller than what the image looks like. If these two aspects needed, then I'd suggest getting a Blue Snowball (not iCE), which has both a mute button and a taller stand (as well as some other qualities).Overall, for £45, this was a good deal, as it is simply a good microphone that requires no setup. Anything more than £45, then I would instead consider buying a Blue Snowball (not iCE), or maybe even a Blue Nessie, as they both have a mute button. For me, I'll continue using the Blue Snowball iCE, and, if I upgrade, I'll probably get a Blue Yeti, seeing as that has better quality and has more features (such as a mixer). But for £45, the Blue Snowball iCE is arguably the best choice.

Bought this because I got fed up having to carry around my smartphone all the time.Nice and compact phone and well worth the £14 I paid. Comes boxed with a charger and battery. I like these phones because the battery lasts a long time and they are quick and easy to use.It was a bit fiddly getting the back off to put the SIM card in, you need a flat knife to prise it off - it's that tight.. but once it's in the back snaps back in with no chance of it coming apart if you drop it. Made a few calls and it sounds very clear. Perfect combined with an unlimited talk and text for £4 a month. Very happy with it.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 October 2023Colour: BlackStyle Name: 4th editionVerified Purchase
This burner takes me back 20 years when I was kid, playing games like snake, learning to text, and prank calling friends whenever I switched numbers.The battery life is impressive, lasted me for days on standby, and the phone holds up pretty well too. So far been dropped from five-foot heights twice and has yet to twitch on me.The only thing I found irritating from time to time is using the navigation button as it sometimes wouldn't properly navigate to the app I want to use, but I suppose the fact that I have big thumbs doesn't really help.It's a good phone to use overrall. Personally I use this phone as a backup for when my main one dies whenever I am out and I haven't a powerbank or an outlet for it to recharge.One thing to note - if you let this phone shut down or die for quite some time between power cycles, the date and time on the phone will go back to its default setting (eg. Jan 01 2021) which you will have to manually rectify the next time you power it on.

A Disappointing Departure from Nokia's Legacy - Returned it ASAP, Beware of Imitations
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2024Colour: BlackStyle Name: 4th editionVerified Purchase
As a devoted Nokia enthusiast, my recent experience with the Nokia 105 left me deeply disappointed and questioning the authenticity of the device. This purchase turned out to be a regrettable encounter with what seems to be a Chinese copy, featuring a fake OS and peculiar features that deviate significantly from the trusted Nokia experience.One of the most glaring issues was the operating system, which felt counterfeit and a far cry from the intuitive and user-friendly interface that Nokia is renowned for. The absence of the familiar Nokia OS left me grappling with an unfamiliar and confusing system, eroding the brand's legacy that I had come to cherish.Furthermore, the inclusion of strange and, frankly, comical features that are not typical of Nokia devices raised serious concerns about the authenticity of the product. These additional elements felt like a misguided attempt to imitate modern smartphones, and they only served to detract from the simplicity and reliability that I associate with the Nokia brand.Given this disappointing experience, I promptly returned the Nokia 105. As a Nokia enthusiast, it pains me to say that I will not be considering another purchase of this model or any similar version that veers so far from the brand's established identity. This experience, along with the immediate return, serves as a cautionary tale for fellow Nokia enthusiasts—beware of imitations and ensure the authenticity of the device before making a purchase. This counterfeit Nokia 105 has left me with a sense of regret and a diminished trust in the brand.

I’ve only just received this but used it this morning before work on my bangs.  I just dampened my bangs and used this product to saturate, distributed through and brushed. I then blow dried with a round brush (with tension as it requests).  Once dry I followed with my usual straightening and slight spray with hair spray and I cannot complain! I leave for work relatively early in the morning so the air is always damp and sticky and by the time I get to work my fringe is very frizzy and wavy and sometimes curly. It never stays straight - it’s a nightmare and then I spend forever having to braid it to make it look decent.  This stuff is a game changer. Tried it out not expecting much and once I got into work my fringe is still sleek and straight!  I’ve had compliments already asking if I’ve had my hair done As it looks so shiny and soft.  It does not feel sticky or leave the hair feeling stiff or heavy. I cannot tell I got anything in my bangs.  When running my fingers through it feels very soft and light.Hopefully this wasn’t just a fluke test but considering my routine has not changed and my bangs have recently been untameable and as soon as I introduce this as an extra step in my routine I’m convinced this stuff does the job!

The BEST doorbell camera by a landslide! 😍😍😍
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 December 2022Colour Name: Satin NickelConfiguration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
After suffering a nightmare of a year with a different brand of camera doorbell, I gave up and invested in this one for the front door.THIS has everything you could dream of! The motion sensor is sensible, so unlike the other brand I had, this one doesn't go off all night long cause it spots a blooming fox!This works seamlessly with Alexa, and once you've got the hang of the settings, you'll soon find that you can have Alexa Show you the doorbell cam live feed, while the doorbell tells your visitors you'll be with them shortly. Which is perfect if you have someone come to the door late at night and you prefer to see them through the Alexa Show BEFORE answering the door, without them leaving cause they think you're not home 😊Next, there's the absolutely superb camera, night vision and two-way audio! There is a very bright street light at the end of my garden and despite this, the night vision can still show individual blades of grass and each stone in the roughcast wall? That is the kind of details you should expect from a security camera not a doorbell so I am jumping for joy about the camera quality, during the day light the camera is second to none too which makes me feel safe 24/7. You can see for yourself from my pics 🙂The audio is crystal clear, so much so that  it I could hear a smoke detector going off in one of the houses at the other end of the street, when I went onto live view so I have zero complaints there! 😂As for the recording length? My previous doorbell brand only recorded 30 seconds max, which was useless on both occasions when I actually needed about a minute. This wee beauty records 2 minutes which is fantastic for if someone dodgy comes to your door, and given the amount of scammers who crawl out of the woodwork during a cost of living crisis, having a device like this wee gem works as a deterrent AND records the ones who chance their luck!This is also great for battery life, easy to charge when it's running low on power and wireless, so once it's connected to the WiFi and up, it's good to go for a decent amount of time! Mine was connected and installed in under 3 minutes, (that includes drilling the pilot holes) and has had a constant connection to the wi-fi signal ever since! To give you a comparison, the other doorbell cam this has replaced took 4 hours to try to connect to their own WiFi network, continuously going round in circles trying to connect then disconnecting after I had to change the batteries one time. But this device was seemless, and practically set itself up for me.When this detects motion, I have it set to record the video and it tells all the Alexa's in the house that someone is at the front door, so even if I'm in the kitchen with the washing machine going, I don't need to worry that I've missed someone at the door.That was my first one of these! I loved it so much I bought another one for the babies nursery as she's just went into her toddler bed and it's set up to alert me when she gets up out of bed. She's only one and a half, so having the motion sensor activate as soon as she's up and about is worth every penny cause anything can happen in a very short space of time with wee ones that young! The motion sensor in the nursery doorbell cam is phenomenal! She can toss and turn though the night, and it will do nothing, but as soon as her feet start dangling of her wee bed, the motion detector kicks in and tells my bedroom Alexa that the baby is up! I have the nursery doorbell cam set up to turn her nursery light on, my room lamp on, and the living room lights on when motion is detected in her room. I also have the ""wait"" feature set in the Alexa app so that the motion sensor doesn't put the nursery light on when I'm putting her to bed at night which is an awesome little known feature!I also have the nursery doorbell cam send a live feed to my bedroom Alexa so I can see her as soon as the motion detector goes off in the morning, enabling me to reassure her through the speaker that mummy will be there in a wee minute so she knows she not all alone.As you can see from my photos, the camera can see the details on her radiator and her chair in the nursery in the pitch black! She has a proper blackout blind, with blackout fabric behind it, and the hall light was off when I took this photo, so there was ZERO light getting into her room! Despite this, the level of detail in this doorbell camera is the best quality I've found in a night vision camera. It even picks up on the difference in shade on her velvet chair as you can see from my picture. It is so crystal clear that I can see if her eyes are open or closed which is priceless. Also, the audio is so clear that when her wee baby snores start, it picks up the sound perfectly enough that Alexa can the stop playing her soothing bedtime music, cause the doorbell detected she was asleep 😍This is exactly what I need from my devices! Peace of mind, quality, security and convenience and this wee doorbell has all of those in bucket-loads! So much so, that I've just purchased a third one for the back door/garden now too 😂All in all, if you are looking for a doorbell camera THIS is definitely the one to get!☺️

Brilliant!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 April 2024Colour Name: Satin NickelConfiguration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
Well, i've had this Ring doorbell a couple of weeks now and i'm very pleased with it, although there is one issue. Notifications on my phone are taking 30 secs to 1 min to come through, which seems to be a common complaint from other sites i've read reviews on. Ring seem to always say it's slow wifi to blame, but it isn't. I have 500mb broadband and by my front door, i have download speeds of 20mb, so i know it isn't the wifi. So, what i've done, is installed the app on my tablets and linked it to Alexa, which appears to be much better, as notifications are near instant!. Something i think should have been put on the camera, is an SD card slot to record motion, rather than be forced to subcribe to a cloud system, which apparently is now £5 per month.  The camera itself is brilliant, easy to set up and very sharp picture wise, even at night. Audio is superb on the two way speaker and recording. I don't know how long the battery would last, because i purchased the adaptor for it and hardwired it, as i don't want to be charging the battery all the time. I also purchased the Ring chime as well, which is easy to set up and provides extra warning. All in all, great camera and well worth the money. One thing i am reading alot about, is that this camera comes with two security screws for the bottom, but people are losing them and sticking wood screws in instead, DON'T, because you will screw into the battery and short it out, so if you lose the screws, get onto Ring who will send replacements.

Absolutely brilliant. The picture quality is superb, sound is amazing and the battery lasts much longer than I expected. The intercom to speak to callers is great too, no lag and very clear and you can adjust the volume to suit your needs. So easy to set up and connects to all my firesticks and Alexas. It even pops up in the corner of my tv screen with a live video of the person who’s at my door and tells me there’s someone at my door which I find very helpful if you’re hard of hearing.

A good way to build your collection of 151 cards
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2023Verified Purchase
I ordered at the start of November and the cards arrived today which is what Amazon had predicted with the length of delivery times - I know from trying to get booster bundles from elsewhere there's apparently UK supply issues!As for the boxes, they were as expected with each having 6 packs in. You can never be sure what you'll get but I got 2 or 3 ""hits"" (as in EX or better) and either 1 or 2 of the shiny energy cards per box just so people have a rough idea of what they may expect. I'm basing this on the 8 boxes I've opened overall with some obv being better and worse! Just remember: nothing is guaranteed.

One of the best electronics I’ve ever bought
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 June 2022Verified Purchase
This little device has saved me a lot of headache.I bought this Google Cast on a whim because my Mum has one, and I wanted to try it. Then my smartTV broke and stopped supporting a viable internet connection, despite connecting to the router. PAIN.The google cast made it possible for me to stream to the broken TV using my tablet/phone, over the home wifi - which has been a great stress reliever.I’m in no position to replace the TV anytime soon, so this device has become pivotal to enjoying my evenings at home!It was very easy to install and didn’t take long at all, it gets a bit hot while running, but I’ve read this is common, and so far performance is not affected. It’s compatible with every service I’ve tried so far: Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Disney+. I’m sure there are more! I’m also a big fan of the screen saver pictures you see when the device is waiting for a cast, sometimes I leave it on just for the ambience alone!For the price, this gadget is great value for money. I’d buy it again in a heartbeat.

A MUST HAVE for any ‘smart’ home!!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 July 2022Verified Purchase
I really debated buying this when I first found it. I thought £30 was quite a lot for something so novel. Then I won an Amazon gift card at work and thought, why not?It arrived in a small box with instructions to advise on how to use it. We have ours connected only to the tv. The usb is connected to the tv and the chrome cast then takes its own port for the hdmi. The instructions were very easy to follow but you do need a smart phone for the app. We were able to find it on both Apple and Google stores.Well, it turns out we use this all the time and it’s amazing! So easy to get up and running. You can link it to more than one device and it works with our phones, laptops and with our PCs. I am so happy to finally be able to show videos or games on a computer and the TV at the same time.It’s really handy for when I’m playing games and my little one wants to watch. I’ll stream it to the TV while I play so she can sit back and watch.We’ve also used it to play music from YouTube on the big screen quickly and easily, along with watching shows we normally wouldn’t be able to watch through our smart tv. We can set up a vpn on our phone or laptop and then cast to the tv.Honestly should have bought it sooner and couldn’t recommend more! A must have for any ‘smart’ home.

Great casting dongle, shame it doesn't support 24Hz refresh
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 August 2021Verified Purchase
I have an 7 year old Panasonic Plasma Smart TV, so it doesn't really have many of the modern apps and is also sluggish to load them natively. However, the image quality is still fantastic, so rather that buy another TV, I decided on the Chromecast as a cheap alternative. It was ideal for giving me access to the many other streaming services now available. It took me a couple of minutes to setup as I already have other Google Home devices and as a tech minded person, it was easy to add. I can now just cast straight to the TV from my Pixel, tablet or PC. I also use NAS as a media centre running Plex server and wanted to cast from that wirelessly (instead of relying on the HDMI connection which I run Kodi through). Whilst it casts Plex fine, Chromecast only supports either 50/60Hz and as most TV shows and movies are filmed at 24Hz, this can result in some juddering when panning. Kodi client has the ability to switch to native 24Hz as it's running directly via HDMI, with the TV handling the refresh rate. It's a shame Chromecast doesn't support this, hopefully a newer model or firmware can add this in the future, then it would be perfect. Still recommended though.

It has got to be the easiest way to stream content for a few pounds.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2021Verified Purchase
I have 3 of these, stream to anything that has a HDMI socket (OK, it needs a wifi connection, and power, power is either from a USB socket on your device or if no USB on the device then a mains adapter (supplied) must be used. Easily connect to a PC monitor, Projector, or any tv (with HDMI inputs) . It would probably work with HDMI adaptors, but I have not got one to test. FYI. I find Chromecast faster and easier that the smart TV apps.... I recently got asked; Can you use your phones hotspot instead of wifi?A: The short answer is YES. It will be cast on any WIFI network. To cast using a mobile network you would need a third device, as the mobile being used as the hotspot would not be able to connect to the chromecast directly.Firstly you will need a good mobile data connection.Set your phone with the mobile data connection up as a hotspot.Connect the third device (another phone, tablet, laptop, pc whatever) to the hotspot network.Optional step (press and hold the button on side of the Chromecast until it resets to factory settings.)Link the third device to the Chromecast using the hotspot wifi details and google home app.Follow the setup instructions and ensure that you connect the Chromecast to the HotSpot Wifi that you created with your mobile...This does work, but do note that you must have a 3 devices, you can not stream directly from the hotspot device. Also Mobile data can be very expensive 1080HD could be >3GB per hour  IMO.

Not All Smart TV Apps Work so this is Essential
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 February 2022Verified Purchase
I bought a new smart TV recently, I think that the WebOS is V6.0. The TV itself is great and most of the pre-installed and downloadable apps work fine. However, I have a Plex Media Server and the TV app for it isn't able to connect to it. Chromecast allows me to fire up the app on a laptop or tablet and cast it to the TV with excellent results. Chromecat works well for all other apps, such as iPlayer, 4oD, ITV Hub etc. etc. For some reason, the smart TV apps for these don't allow you to watch live TV when using them so casting them from your mobile or a laptop is the best way, although you can use Smart View or similar on android mobiles. I could also have used the smart TV browser to connect to the media server but I wanted to be able to cast my desktop, files and folders from my laptop too. Easy to install and good quality pictures.

My WF1000XM4s broke after lesss than 1 year of use down to what seems to be a hilariously common battery drain issue...As such I decided to swerve the new WF1000XM5s. I considered the QC2s but after looking at the reviews and seeing they have bad software and build quality causing connection drop outs amongst other issues. I decided to look away from the most expensive buds.I have tried the Galaxy Buds 2 having had a free pair with my phone. So I'll be comparing the performance of these buds to both the Galaxy Bud 2s and the WF1000XM4s.In terms of sound the WF1000XM4s absolutely smoke the Pixel Buds, with that said though they broke in less than a year so I'm happy to sacrifice some sound quality for earphones that actually function well and efficiently. If you want peak sound quality you should really be forgoing earbuds and going for earphones. With this said the sound is perfectly good for everyday use and comparable to the Galaxy Buds 2, I'd give them a 7.5 out of 10.Google Assistance is ridiculously useful and should be a major selling point for these buds, you also get the Google Buds software which I have to say is easily the most polished with Galaxy Buds software coming second and Sony's a definite dead last.I've had no connection issues, I haven't tested Multipoint yet but if I have issues with it Ill surely come back to update here as that would annoy me enough to do so... so if this isn't updated assume it works well!I've used this buds for a 1 hour workout on the cross trainer going fairly hard. They didn't fall out but I can see why some people may have issues with these when running, the fit isn't as tight as with the Sony's but again quite comparable to the Galaxy Buds. I'd still feel comfortable lifting weights and doing cardio on machine. I feel confident these wouldn't fall out on me personally but everyones ears are different and I can see how this could potentially be an issue for some. If you are worried I'd be tempted to just get a rubber anti loss strap, the extra rubber would create an extra barrier with your ear or ensure under extremely heavy workouts that these wouldn't get lost. Again, for me personally and my ear shape I don't see this being an issue but I know it is for others with these Buds.ANC is good, I would say its a fraction better than Galaxy Buds ANC but a good 30% less ANC than the Sony WF1000XM4s. Having said that I had two pairs of the XM4s and both had a noticeable metallic noise when tapping them or making sharp movements such as when working out and I've read that this is caused by the noise cancellation unit in the Sony's, really annoying and the Buds don't have any of those issues. It's enough to drown out 75% of traffic noise and background music in my local gym which is good enough to immerse myself in the music or podcast and create seperation with the enviroment.Transparency mode is okay, its nowhere near as good as Sony's but again comparable to Galaxy Buds.Battery life is phenomenal and the case is a really nice slim profile which I love. Way better than XM4s and Galaxy Buds in my opinion.

Highly Impressed - Well worth the Investment (warning - long read)
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 February 2023Colour Name: CharcoalVerified Purchase
Firstly, let me apologise for the long read but I really wanted to provide an honest and detailed review, from an ""actual"" consumer who purchased these, to help others hopefully.Let me say I am no audiophile but have always invested in high quality audio equipment.I had bought the Pixel 7 Pro when it was released last year and received the Pixel watch as a free gift and having been impressed with how slick the two worked together had been contemplating finishing off the full Google device ecosystem by purchasing the Pixel Buds Pro but couldn't bring myself to commit to £199 as my existing Senheisser True Wireless buds did me well enough.When the Pixel Buds Pro went down to £129 this week I decided to just take the plunge.I haven't long had them but thought I would share my thoughts / first impressions.- SetupGoogle has really nailed making the setup of their products a slick affair and simple to get everything working well. The experience was as good as I found connecting the Pixel watch to my 7 pro, a very polished one.I was surprised that I actually had to switch from using the medium tips (which I have always used on other buds) to the large but the seal test just wouldn't show the required ""ticks"" until I did.A good fit is critical to getting the best out of these but the same is true for all ""in ear"" buds.Once the seal check was passed then I played quite  a few tracks from different genres, mostly EDM / Chilled House / Hip Hop / D&B) and initially didn't think they were that much better than my previous Senheisser earbuds, although I must admit the Buds Pro were definitely more comfortable to me.- Firmware updateWhilst listening I ran the firmware update which was showing as a Manual update available (taking them from v1.5 to v3.14 firmware revision).  As a side note I really liked the fact I could continue to listen to music whilst the earbud firmware was being downloaded and installed apart from about the last 10 to 20 seconds in the final part of the update process.In my opinion the current 3.14 firmware really brings the Buds Pro to an improved level of performance which was discernable to me over listening to the same track on the initial v1.5 firmware. The detail seemed just the little bit crisper straight away sonically.- SoundThe sound is very clean in it's ""Default"" setting on equalisation, with a well honed separation of details of the layers contained within the tracks I have listen to so far although perhaps a little light in the mid to low bass frequency range.The overall sound profile is warm and detailed, not overpowering, with the highs, mids and bass well presented with good separation.  Track elements are presented very well with motion between left and rights channels clearly noticeable.Interestingly, in reviews I had read (and boy I have read a lot of them) - seemingly review opinions seem to go from one extreme to the other (from reviewers loving them to others hating them) many people had said that the Volume EQ did nothing. In my experience the opposite is completely true. From 0 to around 40-50% there is a noticeable added ""depth"" present when this is switched on which makes listening at lower volumes far more enjoyable. As you then move past circa 50% - 60% the change applied by this setting is no longer present so as not to distort at higher volumes (which, in my humble opinion is exactly what such a setting should do).The EQ has a similar ""well managed"" impact to the sound.  The ""Heavy Bass"" setting adds great overall depth without overpowering other frequencies present or dampening the detail of the tracks being listened to which fits well with the music I prefer to listen to.Having the 5 band equaliser (now available with the latest firmware) is a great addition allowing the ability to tune the sound to each owners preference.I would say that if you drive low and mid bass at maximum levels and then play at full volume to me personally there can be a little ""muddiness"" introduced right at maximum volume level (only on certain tracks with very deep basslines) but that level of ""over focus"" on the lower frequencies isn't what I like when listening to music as I tend to prefer a more detailed, natural sound personally.Tracks that I have listened to on these buds I think show how good they are:The Next Rap God - DaxOvertones (Extended Mix) - FrostRumblah - Gorgon CitySomething, Everything (feat. Richard Walters) - Sultan & ShepardLes Djinns - Djuma SoundsystemMotherboard - Daft Punk- Spatial Sound / AudioI quickly tested this with the fight scene on the airplane in the film ""The Grey Man"" on Netflix. The spatial effects were definitely noticeable (although I am probably spoiled by running a full 7.1.2 system with Yamaha a4a amp and B&W speaker system with B&W PV1D sub at home) but for a mobile phone with in ear buds it is a pretty good initial impression.- ANC / TransparencyA few simple tests of the ANC and transparency capabilities, in my humble opinion, deliver impressively against my expectations. I am sure you can get buds that deliver better ANC/ transparency but I think the Pixel buds are very effective at both. I am sure Google will continue to improve both these areas over time with future updates (or at least I hope they do).- Call QualityCall quality to me is exceptional. Absolutely no complaints from me at all. Very clear at my end and the two calls I made the people I was speaking to couldn't tell that I wasn't using the actual phone although I did make the calls from indoors.It may be different when calling from outdoors, time will tell over the next few days.- Touch ControlsI had always been impressed by the touch controls on my Senheissers but the performance of touch controls on the Buds Pro are an improvements over those.I love the ""slide to"" increase/ decrease volume which seems to work very well and consistently for me.- Google Assistant Functionality/ IntegrationAs I had hoped for it is seemless. I am a heavy user of Google Assistant and ""Hey Google"" detection and recognition of my voice commands is exactly what I had hoped for with every verbal command I have issued being responded to flawlessly this far.- Areas Google will hopefully improve / enhance with future updatesI think enhancements could be made by Google in the following areas, and hopefully they will with future firmware updates, and these are:1) A slightly ""wider"" sound stage would be nice although as previously stated separation is well handled with them currently.  I also think this would deliver improvements for the spatial audio effect.2) The ability to change the level of transparency would be a nice option to have.3) Adaptive volume based upon external environment - It would be nice for the Buds Pro to adapt as external environment sounds change to keep a consistent perceived volume level whenOverallI think these are fantastic buds, especially if you can get them for the price I did.Many manufacturers seemed to have moved away from clarity and naturalness of sound in earbuds / headphones but personally I still like clarity and detail over the ""over-driven / Xtra bass"" sound that so many manufacturer audio products seem to focus on nowadays. (Probably why I love B&W and Yamaha audio products in the home).When everything is taken into account (sound performance / call quality/ touch controls / battery life / ANC / transparency / spatial audio / assistant features and integration) I think these are well worth the investment (for owners of Android devices and especially for Pixel device owners) and have absolutely no issue in highly recommending them.And hopefully with future updates they will just continue to improve.A great entry into the ""Pro"" arena of earbuds from Google, delivering what I personally think is great performance vs cost and a great foundation for (hopefully) further improvements / enhancements to be delivered with software updates.I hope this review was worth the effort to read for those that took the time to do so and helps others make an informed decision as to whether these might be suitable for their needs.

The Google Pixel Buds Pro are a fantastic pair of truly wireless earbuds. They offer excellent sound quality with rich bass and clear highs, making them perfect for listening to music or watching movies. The active noise cancellation is impressive, effectively blocking out ambient noise for a more immersive audio experience.What really sets these earbuds apart is their seamless integration with Android devices. Pairing is a breeze, and features like instant device switching and Google Assistant integration work flawlessly. The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing you to control playback, adjust volume, and access your digital assistant with ease.Battery life is decent, providing around 7 hours of listening time with ANC enabled, and the wireless charging case is a convenient option for on-the-go charging.Overall, if you're an Android user looking for a premium pair of true wireless earbuds with great sound and seamless integration, the Google Pixel Buds Pro are definitely worth considering.

Pros: sound and noise cancelling is fantastic, Google intergeneration for pixel phones also super. Battery lasts as long as is needed and charging of case and buds is very quick.Con: getting right position in ears or correctly into the charger case can be awkward. Gesture controls I had to turn off, otherwise the volume would change or the song would skip every time I took them out for a moment. Personally I think these should always be a button of some sort, it seems strange to me to tickle your ear every time you want to change songs.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 March 2017Style Name: Camera (2016 Discontinued Model)Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )Verified Purchase
Requires a full charge fresh out the box before anything else - Then it gives you options to set date and time, and runs through a quick tutorial of all the settings. I thought this was great, very intuitive, and you don’t need to read the manual at all.Love the actual camera settings, although the WB presets are set a bit strange, no standard 3800k or 5600k settings but it goes up in 1000k increments.The new stabilisation (available at 1080p and 1440p only) is noticeable and good. It's not going to make your footage look like it was shot steadicam, but against the equivalent shot on the Hero 4, it takes away some of the visible vibration.FOOTAGE--------------Added some stills (pictured), ultra sharp with that 'GoPro' look (if you're a dab hand with post production you can quite easily get rid of this) but I like that the features in camera now allow you to reduce some of it at choice - shoot a flat profile, reduce the sharpening and play with the aspect.120fps slow motion available at 1080p; 240fps at 720p, 60fps at 2.5k and 30fps at 4K.APP USAGE-----------------The main 'capture' app has has some serious work and it works fantastically with the HERO 5. Download and connect via a wifi that the camera itself transmits - connect to the wifi as you would any wifi on your phone, and it keeps the connection to the camera extremely well. The live feed is real time with minimal lag (previous GoPro's have had serious lag problems) and it has a range of about 20m before it drops out - the camera will keep recording, but your feed will disappear.The other two, Quik and Splice - are video editing apps that use GoPro footage but you can also use any footage that's on your phone. They work well; for the average consumer they do the job. For anything more polished i'd stick with the classic approach of putting on your computer and editing there, just for storage purposes.NEGATIVES-----------------Battery life. It's a new battery compared to previous versions and it does last longer - but it's still around 2 hours max. If you're pushing 4K or pressing start stop a lot, it's going to drain quicker. Full recharge takes around 2 hours.Using the touchscreen for me is an absolute nightmare, I prefer the bulky repeated push buttons of previous versions. However, the app works remarkably and this does outweigh it.On the subject of needing your phone though, battery life on that is also a problem with the capture app running. I'd invest in a portable battery if you're serious about using it.NOTES----------The body is now completely watertight, but i'd double check there are no open seams on the compartments - the battery one i've noticed requires extra force to make sure it's properly clicked in.Personally i'd recommend SanDisk MicroSD Extreme Pro cards. You want at least class 10 UHS-3 to avoid drop frames when filming at the higher resolutions. I always use these cards as SanDisk come with a lifetime guarantee.The clip/mount has remained the same so all GoPro accessories will still work - but the battery and charger is now different to previous versions.OVERALL-------------As an upgrade from the 3 and 4, it's really noticeable and has straightened out some of the problems. It's now a lot easier to use, and as someone who uses the GoPro a lot, I love this version of it more than others i've owned. They are made for hobbyist video makers, holiday video makers and action sports - the picture is ultra wide and it's features are mostly in video, so if you're looking for a camera that's small but you're most likely to take portraits, i'd maybe look elsewhere or even for additional accessories for your phone's camera instead.

Lots of new features
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 May 2017Style Name: Camera (2016 Discontinued Model)Verified Purchase
Noticeable improvement over the Hero 4 Black, faster boot time, image stabilisation, onboard hi-def touch screen, waterproof without additional housing, voice control, GPS for telemetry (speed, location, G force which can be overlaid during editing with Quik) AND improved battery life.The 5 is a departure from the form of the 3, 3+ and most recently Hero 4 Black. The 5 is now a dark grey (rather than silver) and the original housings do not appear to be compatible, even though the lens part of the 5 can be detached/ replaced.Connection is now via a USB C cable which still has a mini HDMI socket below it for direct connection to a TV. The waterproof door can be fully removed if you need to keep it supplied with power during use.The camera ships with a frame style mount which will suit most applications, however this offers no impact protection (think flying stones when attached to the exterior of a car) and although the lens has a replaceable cover/ glass, the front screen does not. I think the dive housing or equivalent is a necessary investment if externally mounting the camera. 2 sticky mounts, a low profile base clip and short USB-C cable are included too.The touch screen is a great addition as it not only is it very high quality, it makes setting changes a doddle, framing shots and reviewing footage it also contains a video user manual which makes it very user friendly if it's operated infrequently. The camera seems to boot up and respond to commands quickly.I can't comment on memory card compatibility for this model but all earlier ones have had issues when using ""cheap"" memory cards- camera locks up, doesn't operate, etc. I have since only used the endorsed Lexar or SanDisk High speed micro SD cards and haven't had any issues.Overall I'm very pleased with the Hero 5 Black and can't see any reason I'll be using my Hero 4 going forward!

I bought this about 3 years ago after much consideration as he cost was a lot to me at that time. However I was eager to have an under water camera as we had started to holiday a lot and was missing great photo and video opportunities. For underwater recording I found the GoPro to be fantastic. The images attached underwater were from this year in Barbados (I know the turtle photos are amazing!!). When under the water it can be tricky to see the GoPro screen - You usually learn to just click and point as the angle is wide so it will catch where the lens is pointed.I do find that the photo quality however is not that good and so we tend to use our iPhones when out of water to take photographs.We find that if you are using it to take photos and short videos all throughout the day (as you do on holiday) then it would require daily charging. You can buy an additional battery but we havnt done as it can be expensive.Waterproof case hasn’t failed so far and we have scuba diver up to 18 metres (although it did power off at this depth- but powered back on when in more shallow water). Not sure if it can’t  handle that depth one if ours perhaps has a fault now.Anyway would definitely recommend this GoPro !Ps you can buy the additional float handles , self stick handles quite cheap.

I bought this game after £60 Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and it feels like an early alpha version where the developers forgot to add half the game. Would be 5 stars if they lowered the price to £30 and added the missing settings.PROs+ Some very fun levels+ Shorter loading times than Smash UltimateCONs- Extremely overpriced- No settings menu to change difficulty, controls, graphics, split screen, camera, sounds, items, level selection- You cannot remap buttons to match other racing games- Only 1 player can navivate throigh the menu- Hardly any characters, and not enough skins- The few options in the game are not explained- Grand prix has no options of race laps, duration, player number, difficulty ane map selection- Only 32 maps that always go in the same direction- No reverse maps or circuits like in Asphalt 7 or Need for Speed Hot Pursuit- Awful controls- 2 player split screen makes it very hard to predict the turns- Near zero customisation optiona apart from your vehicle

I overpaid for mine and I wish I had held off for a few months to view the chat rooms and GoPro group's.  The fish eye look on the snapshots are a problem for me, I just don't like distorted images so I use my regular camera for these which sort of defeats the object of having a really portable camera the 5k video in my case is not as good as the version 10. It's full of bugs due in main to t packing so much into such a tiny camera, it has no breathing space or ventilation so even with the new enduro battery your lucky to get 20 minutes video from the camera especially if used in the media mod. As action cameras go, GoPro I think has reached its limit, the Hero 11 Black isn't reliable enought for your action picks, you could spend ages perfecting your stunts or special moments only to loose the shot with a shut down or freeze.

The Pritt Glue Stick is a true lifesaver for arts and crafts enthusiasts, parents, and educators alike. It's not just a glue stick; it's a reliable partner in creativity.One of the standout features of this glue stick is its safety and child-friendliness. It's non-toxic, washable, and free from harmful chemicals, making it perfect for kids' craft projects. As a parent, I have peace of mind knowing that my child can use it safely.The strength of the hold is impressive. It securely bonds paper, cardboard, fabric, and more without any mess or fuss. It dries quickly, allowing for efficient and hassle-free crafting.The convenience of the twist-up design is another plus. It's mess-free, and there's no need to worry about lost caps or dried-out glue. The ergonomic shape of the stick fits comfortably in the hand, making it easy for kids and adults to use.In summary, the Pritt Glue Stick is a must-have for any arts and crafts activities. It combines safety, convenience, and strong adhesion into one fantastic product. I couldn't be happier with its performance, and it has earned every one of these 5 stars!

Fantastic product
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2021Verified Purchase
This is great I saw a lot of negative reviews but the thing to remember with wig caps is firstly they are thin so will tear if not handled with care, to get a bald effect it isn’t just put on and there you go a nude wig cap covers the hair then the bald cap and then it’s painted skin colour to look bald. And they don’t just fit you need to carefully cut them to size allowing for room to stick it down hopefully this will help future buyers. That being said performance is good I didn’t have to cut it too much it didn’t take a lot of work to cover the seams either and the paint washed off great afterwards I’d definitely purchase again

Love it.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2012Style Name: Aqua BlueVerified Purchase
As a bonkers Nintendo fangirl and collector for the past 20 years, I pre-ordered this and got it on release. For several months, however, it did just sit there, virtually unused.But then the GOOD games started appearing. :DThe first game I actually got for my 3DS was Ocarina of Time 3D, three months after this came out, and I finally got to see the 3D in action properly.The 3D is actually pretty good - obviously you just have to make sure to hold the console in the right position, otherwise you'll get a weird double image. It can be quite impressive, although sometimes when I have the 3D on I feel like my eyes are crossing to try and focus on it properly - I find having the slider turned up about halfway is just about right.However, I actually think games look better with the 3D turned OFF. The lines are much clearer and the console really does have some smashing graphics. I now usually only turn on the 3D for cutscenes.Since Ocarina of Time, I've bought Star Fox, Mario Kart, and Super Mario 3D Land. You can really appreciate the 3D on Mario, it's actually fantastic.And then there's the Virtual Console. This was what I was most excited for the 3DS for - being able to download old Gameboy, Gameboy Colour, and Game Boy Advance games, just like you can download old console games on the Wii. For quite a long time, releases on the VC seemed slow, but they've been picking up recently and there are some cracking titles available to download, like Zelda: Link's Awakening, Kirby, Wario Land, and Super Mario Land: 6 Golden Coins, amongst others. The games are all reasonably priced (between around £3.60 and £5.40ish, depending on the game), and being older games, don't take up much space at all on the SD card, so you can cram it full of golden oldies.Any old SD card will work with the 3DS, and one comes free with the console, unlike some consoles that are only compatible with overpriced memory cards made by the same company (*cough*Vita*cough*) You can top up the amount of cash to download games either by debit card, or by purchasing an eshop card from a shop (NOT a Nintendo points card! Must be an eshop card).You can also download all the DSiWare stuff on your 3DS, too.Plus, there are game videos you can download, AND game demos, so you can try out some games before you buy them.Have a DSi? Want a 3DS? Have purchased DSiWare that you'd like to keep on your 3DS? No problem. Nintendo have added a simple to use Data Transfer system, which you can use to transfer EVERYTHING from a DSi over to your shiny new 3DS, or even from 3DS to 3DS. Absolutely everything is transferred, and afterwards the console that had been transferred from is reset to factory settings.I myself used the Data transfer system when I bought a different 3DS (The limited edition Zelda one... it's so shiny) and needed to transfer the stuff I had already downloaded from my old 3DS. I can confirm that it really is easy to use - it's completely fool-proof - and it really does transfer everything - VC downloads, saves, etc.If there are people here who, like me, bought the 3DS on release and as a result got the 20 free Ambassador games, and you'd like a new 3DS (there are more pretty limited edition ones coming!), rest assured, the system transfer does transfer your Ambassador status and your free games. :)In all, this is a great console. Yeah, the 3D can be a bit gimmicky at times, but it does work well, and you can turn it off whenever you like. Now that it has a better games library, it's much more fun, and the Virtual console is just great. Plus with great upcoming games like Kid Icarus: Uprising (It looks amazing!), Luigi's Mansion 2, and Fire Emblem (confirmed for Europe!), it's going to get even better. The price reduction last August makes it even more of a must buy - I paid £180 for mine on release, which was about as cheap as you could get. It's dropped very significantly since!But at least I have my 20 free games to make up for the price-drop. Cheers Ninty! :D

Tweaking an already brilliant COD 4
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 December 2015Platform For Display: Xbox 360Edition: Standard EditionVerified Purchase
A stunning sequel to an already stunning franchise.The story of Modern Warfare 2 picks up straight from where Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare left off. This can be a little confusing as there was another Call of Duty game released (Call of Duty World at War) in between by another developer (Treyarch).The story again is like playing through a Hollywood blockbuster film and the Activision stuck to their guns with the formula of COD4.Why fix what aint broke? They did however make a few tweaks which only made the game better. Things such as making a shotgun as a secondary weapon online - as it was a waste of a primary in the first game (due to their limited role) so they didn't get used.Kill streaks were now hugely varied and are now customisable. Originally it was 3 kills for a UAV, 5 for a harrier strike and 7 for a chopper.Now you still have only 3 but you could choose whatever you wanted from numerous different streaks. The higher the streak, the more effective the reward.Additionally you had something they called player cards which consisted of a symbol and a background that you could project a bit of personality into so the person could see who killed them.These again are amassed over time by completing various challenges keeping the game interesting and again, very addictive.Oh I totally forgot an entire portion to this review! SPEC OPS!Spec ops is an additional set of 'mini missions' to play in additional to the story and online.A series of challenging missions that you can do alone or with a friend online to try and obtain 3 stars on each.An impressive amount were available with the games release but as per usual, more are available if you're willing to cough up extra cash for a couple of extra downloadable content packs that contains a few extra online maps as well.From this point on, the Call of Duty franchise had an awesome amount of content on release which was more than adequate. But for those that wanted more the Call of Duty cash cow provided.

Yes , this is a great follow up to mind blowing , apart from the Brit SAS mission COD 4 . I loved the graphics , and the environment looks awesome and the locations in Northern Virginia and Russia looked fantastic !! I really liked the re taking of D.C back from the Russians and I felt like I was part of the awesome team along side with the rangers . I did like the whatever it was called unit mission when gaz was killed or ghost was the name that disgusting Eastenders scag was voicing and putting his personality behind this time . The protection of the house was awesome in that mission as well though .As a challenge I used the M9 pistol and G18 pistol , rather than  using the M4 .But I went down to the armory to pick up an M4 for the retreat after the device we were protecting had downloaded . Great buy and great to hear Lance Henrickson  playing general Shepard and the character whooping the younger , supposedly superior member of HM SAS Captain price at the end , despite being injured (Shepard that is ) .How realistic that would be .Oh on the front cover , the US soldier has an M16 A2/A3 but has a scope mounted , but still having the front sight mounted which would just magnify the front sight even if 4 by 20 magnification , rather than magnifying the forward area .Virtually all scopes have cross hairs , red dot contained within the scope and therefore you dont need a front sight which would magnify that and would get in the way .

As one of the most critically acclaimed shooters of all time, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a prime example of a tough act to follow. Yet, amidst a raging storm of anticipation and expectation, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has done it. The campaign is chock-full of intense action and dramatic moments, and though it is more muddled than its predecessor (in more ways than one), it's still an absolute blast. The new Special Ops mode allows you to experience some campaign-inspired thrills with a friend and it's an engaging challenge to coordinate your maneuvers and tackle the varied objectives. Last but not least, the competitive multiplayer that took the online shooter community by storm two years ago is back and better than ever. Though the addictive action remains the same at its core, there are a host of new elements that make it more accessible, more strategic, and more rewarding. This all adds up to a thoroughly excellent package that is sure to thrill shooter fans and deprive them of sleep for months to come.

This is one of my top purchases from amazon! I bought it so me and my brother could play it and have a good time, and surely enough we did! The career mode is very intense and it's almost like watching a high production value movie!But when you're done that you can move on to the famous multiplayer mode where the possibilities are endless!You can play online with friends and family through Xbox Live or simply invtite a friend over and he can pick a controller up and you can start battling against each other in one of the wide range of realistic map packs!Activision - the creators of the game - release map packs every so often so really the fun never ends with Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2!Ray

Amazon 3rd GEN Fire TV Cube with My BenQ 4K HDR Projector
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 April 2023Configuration: Fire TV CubeVerified Purchase
My Home Cinema System consists of a BenQ 4K HDR UST Projector, the Amazon 2nd Gen Fire TV Cube (Since Nov 2019) and a Denon 4K HDR Receiver. I turn all my Home Cinema Equipment ON & OFF using a Backlit-LCD Logitech Elite Remote / Hub setup.Despite my previously submitted, lengthy Amazon Post on why I am staying with my 2nd Gen Fire TV Cube (now removed), I just couldn’t resist upgrading to Amazon’s Latest 3rd Gen Cube.As usual, the Device was delivered the next day, well Packaged, with a nice Finish & Build Quality of the Cube, Remote (not used) and Power Supply.It may be worth mentioning that when I recently added a Nvidia Shield TV Pro Streaming device to my Home Cinema System, I was informed by one of my Subscription Services, that I had reached my Licence Limit. Mindful of this and just to be on the safe side, I De-Registered my 2nd Gen Fire TV Cube, having first signed out of all my Subscription Services, prior to setting  my new 3rd Gen Cube.Pairing my Alexa Remote PRO (purchased separately), was straight forward as was signing into my Amazon Prime Account. As previously stated, I use a Logitech Remote to turn all my Home Cinema Equipment ON & OFF. This is because most Remotes, including Amazon Remotes cannot be setup to turn my Projector OFF. My Projector has a quirky feature that requires the OFF button to be pressed twice before it turns OFF (even with its Original Remote). My Logitech Elite Remote allows me to program the 4K Projector, as a Device, with 2 OFF Commands, having a 1 second delay between each which works fine. My Logotech Remote is paired with the Fire TV Cube allowing full control of the Cube. However, once started, I prefer to use the more conveniently sized Backlit Alexa TV Remote PRO whilst viewing the Fire TV Cube Streaming Services.Obviously, I want the Amazon Remote to control my Denon's Volume / Mute, but the Cubes setup process requires that a TV is selected before you can add a Soundbar / Receiver Equipment. Generally, TVs are straight forward to setup with the Fire TV Cube but the same cannot be said for my Projector. The process involves the Cube turning the Connected TV OFF then ON again. Following the onscreen instructions, for Projectors, you need to press the Amazon Remotes Menu Key. Then you are confronted with a selection of IR Codes to switch the Projector OFF and then ON again. Obviously, as already stated, no single IR code would ever work for the OFF Command. Personally, I’m not keen on the idea of quickly turning a Laser Projector OFF-ON again, before the Lamp has had time to cool down. I decided to Select BenQ as a TV and told Alexa that this TV did turn OFF and ON again, which was not true. Now I was given the option to add a Soundbar / Receiver to my Cubes Equipment list. Setting up Alexa Remote PRO Volume / Mute buttons to work with my 4K Denon Receiver was straight forward. Having Logged back into all my Subscription Services, I completed the setup process by programming Buttons 1 & 2 on the Alexa Remote PRO, allowing instant access of 2 Apps (ITVX & Freevee) not visible on the Amazon Prime Start-Up Screen Banner.All in all, I am very pleased that I have Upgraded my Home Cinema System with the latest 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube from Amazon. The truth is, I cannot really detect any significant Performance improvement over my 2nd Gen Fire TV Cube, but everything is Fast, Smooth and Responsive. Two of the additional features that this 3rd Gen Cube includes are Wi-Fi 6E and the HDMI 2.1 Input. Upgrading to a Wi-Fi 6E Network seems to be quite an expensive undertaking, whilst I currently have no interest using the Cubes HDMI Input for other devices. I believe the Image Quality of the 3rd Gen Cube looks better than its predecessor. I did notice, whilst drilling down the various 3rd Gen Cube Menus, under Display & Audio / Display that the last option allows you to turn, “Super Resolution” ON or OFF, which when turned ON produces a Sharper Picture. This may explain my perceived Image Quality Enhancement over this Cubes predecessor.My 2nd Gen TV Cube sounded very tinny and unpleasant. To get around this, I redirected the 2nd Gen Cubes audio output to my 3rd Gen Echo Dot (Fabric version), the sound quality being very much on par with the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube. Having upgraded to the 3rd Gen Fire Tv Cube, I no longer need the 3rd Gen Echo Dot, meaning one less power socket is being used.To Summarise, the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube is a Superior Device over its predecessor, including a couple of additional, worthwhile features, which I may come to appreciate sometime in the future. This Fire TV Cube’s Processors have also been upgraded from a Hexi-Core to an Octa-Core, offering a higher level of technical performance than its predecessor.These days Voice Control of Hi-Fi & Domestic equipment is a feature that really does need to be included, with Streaming Devices, to remain competitive. I find the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube's Voice Control, every bit as capable as its 2nd Gen predecessor. I have a couple of Smart Sockets to operate Audio equipment using Alexa Voice Control and most of the rooms in my home use Alexa Voice Control to switch Lighting On-Off. Although the initial novelty factor has worn off somewhat, Voice Control is a still a cool feature. Alexa Voice Control through the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube, does work well, but being Old-School, I prefer to use the Alexa Remote Pro / Logitech Elite for my Home Cinema Device Control / Navigation.I am pleased that I have upgraded to the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube which I purchased at an Amazon reduction of £20 on the normal selling price. This effectively reduced the  price of the Alexa Remote PRO which I had purchased previously for use with my 2nd Gen Fire TV Cube.I would Recommend the Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen, with a Big-Thumbs-Up, hence this 5 Star Review.  ***** REVIEW UPDATE – 7th June 2023 ****At this moment in time, my BenQ 4K Projector is being repaired, so I’m using my old LG 55” 4K OLED TV (with Screen-Burn). The BIG plus is, because I’m not using the BenQ Projector (2 OFF Commands), I can use the Amazon Remote Pro to Switch my LG TV, Fire TV Cube & Denon Receiver ON & OFF. This means I do not need to use my Logitech Elite Remote at all.Another change I have made, which I initially shunned, is to connect my Nvidia Shield TV Pro into the Fire TV Cubes HDMI 2.1 Input. This has freed up one Denon 4K HDMI Input, allowing me to quickly switch between the Amazon Cube and the Nvidia Shield. This makes Audio-Visual Comparison between the two Devices much Easier and Effective than having to change Denon Inputs to select each of the Streaming Devices. So, the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube’s HDMI 2.1 Input is a very worthwhile addition.My Home Cinema preference is to turn each required Hi-Fi Device On-Off without using HDMI CEC Auto-Sensing. This, I believe, made the detection of the Nvidia Shield’s HDMI Signal via the Fire TV Cubes HDMI Input, somewhat more challenging than expected but with perseverance was achieved.Nvidia Shield TV Pro Amendment 21.09.2023Since connecting my Shield TV Pro to the Fire TV Cubes 2.1 HDMI Input, I have been experiencing regular 1 second Audio Drop-Outs. It would seem that this Audio Drop-Out issue has been flagged many times since 2019 by Shield TV Pro owners. I think this may have something to do with HDMI Pass-Through compatibility. As I’m fully conversant with the Pros & Cons of the Cube and the Shield Streaming Devices, I no longer require the previously mentioned, efficient Audio-Visual comparison switching. My Shield TV Pro is now connected to its own dedicated Denon HDMI Input, whilst I now use the Fire TV Cubes HDMI 2.1 Input, with my FreeviewPlay SD/HD Player/Recorder. This has sorted the Shields Audio Drop-Outs, whilst Switching between the Cube and the TV Set-Top Box makes far more sense and is a more convenient setup.

Updated 9 Month Review
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2022Configuration: Fire TV CubeVerified Purchase
There is so much that is great about the all new Cube and with continuing regular updates it is one of the best streaming devices on the market... it's lightning fast with a USB interface and Ethernet, although it is disappointing that these connections are somewhat outdated. Ethernet is only 10/100 so it could be a struggle to stream your own content from a home server (Plex, Emby, Kodi etc.) without transcoding the video/audio. However, the WiFi 6 implementation is a welcome addition and bypasses the problem, assuming you have the Network capability so it's something to bear in mind when buying. I think my advice to amazon going forward would be anyone paying £140 for the device would have probably paid £160 for Gigabit ethernet and Superspeed USB.The new look is great, and it's now uniform with the rest of the Echo range (No more fingerprints to clean!!)Prime Video has seen lots of updates, I'm now experiencing excellent streaming quality with the correct resolutions and adaptive HDR setting activating with the correct refresh rates and audio bitstreams. I've seen a few negative postings about the super resolution upscaling. However, when I play a native 1080p and the screen resolution of the content video matches the native video display resolution - the upscaling really kicks in and works brilliantly!!All apps I have tried are now bit-streaming Dolby signals at DD+/Atmos, but under the guise of pcm/multi dds. A very welcome recent update has allowed True HD signals to be encoded and I'm getting Dolby signals and DTS X Bit-streamed from these audio codecs. I'm hearing a clarity of sound I've not experienced on a Fire device before and it will suit most cinephiles with half decent AV/Soundbar setups!! Tip for anyone wanting to pass through... Be aware that the cube is quite capable of processing all the codecs while keeping the voice assistant audible and features when watching on plex/vlc/kodi. You're going to see PCM-multi on your display but from my most recent experience and testing it's because the cube takes it all in and outputs it at a raw (pcm multi level) format to be able to cooperate with the alexa voice responses but I've noticed no difference when passing through directly except alexa responses won't happen when doing it this way.... brilliance from the amazon team and more people need to be aware of its function.The Cube Prime music is pretty decent although casting from the mobile app will play through an Alexa screen card as opposed to the native music app, which makes sense since different devices will have different audio capabilities in a group speaker setting... Although if I send music to the group where my TV cube is from somewhere else it plays through the the music app and all becomes a little confusing and disparate at times.It’s worth noting that there has been some customer pushback about the new way music selection/playback for prime subscribers now works with certain caveats on listening choice so research this if buying.It’s not personally an issue as I have always subscribed to prime music in addition, and may I say it's worth every penny if you have an Atmos/Spatial audio setup as more and more tracks are being added in these formats). I'm experiencing 24/192 playback Ultra HD when available in the music app and atmos/3d tracks sound amazing.It would be nice if I could add a song to my playlist via voice in the amazon music app... but apparently no music is playing when attempting the command... even a button selection to add the current song to playlist would be helpful in the app.On that note, the ability to play Amazon music from the mobile phone app to devices/multiroom music groups can now can be minimised for background play... so you can still browse other content of some apps without it stopping playback and is a welcomed feature. When using this playback mode, you can also add songs to playlist via voice command. It also behaves this way for multi-room music which is great if someone is also listening somewhere in the house while you're browsing around content, although again some apps do take control of the system audio on launch which will cut the music off (such as BBC Iplayer, ITVX, and Channel 4 Apps..... however, browsing home screen content, prime video, YouTube and silk web browsing is fine).Hopefully, Amazon is aware of this and going forward they could request app publishers not to take audio control on app launch, but rather on selecting an item for playback within their app.The HDMI IN for a set-top cable/satellite TV box or other HDMI Device is brilliant. I have a PC going through and is comfortably handling 4K resolutions @ 60HZ - it's an amazing feature that really makes it stand out from other devices and Alexa overlays for info cards/cameras is such a great feature. I only wish it had perhaps even an extra one or two HDMI In ports, but who's to say Amazon couldn't introduce their own HDMI switcher to add additional ports, maybe? Since the device is compatible with Hdmi 2.1 it would also be great to see 120hz vrr handled in the future of the device.On balance, I really recommend this product, especially if you have an existing Alexa ecosystem in your smart home. It is regularly maintained and updated by the Fire TV team, who have listened to feedback and responded with some great work and it has really gone from strength to strength - so well done guys! Would be nice to see the fire TV ambient screen option come to this device since the new 2023 fire TV 4k stick will be getting it, I'm sure this device is capable. Keep up the great work!

You're going to see PCM-multi on your display but from my most recent experience and testing it's because the cube takes it all in and outputs it at a raw (pcm multi level) format to be able to cooperate with the alexa voice responses but I've noticed no difference when passing through directly except alexa responses won't happen when doing it this way.... brilliance from the amazon team and more people need to be aware of its function.The Cube Prime music is pretty decent although casting from the mobile app will play through an Alexa screen card as opposed to the native music app, which makes sense since different devices will have different audio capabilities in a group speaker setting... Although if I send music to the group where my TV cube is from somewhere else it plays through the the music app and all becomes a little confusing and disparate at times.It’s worth noting that there has been some customer pushback about the new way music selection/playback for prime subscribers now works with certain caveats on listening choice so research this if buying.It’s not personally an issue as I have always subscribed to prime music in addition, and may I say it's worth every penny if you have an Atmos/Spatial audio setup as more and more tracks are being added in these formats). I'm experiencing 24/192 playback Ultra HD when available in the music app and atmos/3d tracks sound amazing.It would be nice if I could add a song to my playlist via voice in the amazon music app... but apparently no music is playing when attempting the command... even a button selection to add the current song to playlist would be helpful in the app.On that note, the ability to play Amazon music from the mobile phone app to devices/multiroom music groups can now can be minimised for background play... so you can still browse other content of some apps without it stopping playback and is a welcomed feature. When using this playback mode, you can also add songs to playlist via voice command. It also behaves this way for multi-room music which is great if someone is also listening somewhere in the house while you're browsing around content, although again some apps do take control of the system audio on launch which will cut the music off (such as BBC Iplayer, ITVX, and Channel 4 Apps..... however, browsing home screen content, prime video, YouTube and silk web browsing is fine).Hopefully, Amazon is aware of this and going forward they could request app publishers not to take audio control on app launch, but rather on selecting an item for playback within their app.The HDMI IN for a set-top cable/satellite TV box or other HDMI Device is brilliant. I have a PC going through and is comfortably handling 4K resolutions @ 60HZ - it's an amazing feature that really makes it stand out from other devices and Alexa overlays for info cards/cameras is such a great feature. I only wish it had perhaps even an extra one or two HDMI In ports, but who's to say Amazon couldn't introduce their own HDMI switcher to add additional ports, maybe? Since the device is compatible with Hdmi 2.1 it would also be great to see 120hz vrr handled in the future of the device.On balance, I really recommend this product, especially if you have an existing Alexa ecosystem in your smart home. It is regularly maintained and updated by the Fire TV team, who have listened to feedback and responded with some great work and it has really gone from strength to strength - so well done guys! Would be nice to see the fire TV ambient screen option come to this device since the new 2023 fire TV 4k stick will be getting it, I'm sure this device is capable. Keep up the great work!

great stress toy!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 November 2023Verified Purchase
when I first received this product I was slightly disappointed because it's very tough + you have to put quite a lot of strength into squeezing it. however, I grew to love this over time. it's quite satisfying to be able to squeeze something hard without it getting to its squeezable limit so easily. I find this Needoh Nice Cube really nice to play with whilst doing something longer term, i.e. watching something, relaxing, whilst on your phone. however I wouldn't say it's a good item for moments of shorter term intense stress, like holding for comfort in a dentist appointment whilst having a filling done, for example. this is just my personal opinion though! I really like this and id recommend buying it if you're a fan of collecting stuff like this, as I am! I'd definitely say it's one of my favourites now. the fact it's clear is very satisfying :)I received the colour purple!

I’m late diagnosed Autistic, I saw someone on TikTok I think recommend it and it looked very satisfying so I had to get itIt’s like slime but not upkeep, very durable so far (others complained about leaks), when I have a little bit of blue tack I tend to make it into a cube shape so this is perfect since it really retains the cube shape. The colder it is the harder it is to mess with, winter here in Ireland but your hands etc can warm it up and very easy to squish and poke etcIt’s hefty in weight, it’s not one I’d keep in my pocket like the Tangle fidget but it’s lovely to have at home and squeeze, it’s way more than a “stress ball” cause I don’t like those, this feels great and very satisfying :)

I bought this for myself and thought it was really really nice and super soothing to play with but unfortunately after a week it began getting air bubbles. Turns out this was because of a really small break in the seal at the bottom. Luckily I was able to mend it with some super glue and duct tape but be sure to avoid stretching it if possible. I'm rebuying it and applying a drop of super glue before hand just to prevent it happening again

The best noise cancelling headphones for Apple customers.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 July 2021Colour Name: Space GrayVerified Purchase
TL/DR: Superb build quality, astonishingly good audio quality and best in class ANC add up to be the very best noise cancelling headphones you can buy, as long as you intend to use them with Apple hardware. Users of Android phones or windows desktops are probably better served by other options.Longer review:The first impression when these come out of the box is the sheer excellence of the build quality. The aluminium ear cups, stainless steel head band and soft memory foam ear pads all add up to a build quality that looks, feels and is light years ahead of any other offering at this or even much higher price points. By comparison competing headphones that are made of plastic, however well made, feel nastily cheap by comparison. Apple always focus on build quality and aesthetics and here they have outdone themselves.Comfort is surprisingly excellent. These headphones feel and are weighty but never feel heavy even after lengthy listening sessions. The fabric & memory foam ear pads combine with the mesh on the head band to make them surprisingly comfortable despite their relative weight. Again full marks in this department.The active noise cancelling is very impressive. When switched on the outside world really does simply disappear. Best of all, the sound signature is in no way affected by turning on ANC. No distortion, no hiss, no background noise at all. Again very impressive. Similarly transparency mode is handled equally well - turn it on and the effect is that of the headphones seeming to disappear. External sound is clear but so is whatever music you have playing. The engineers at Apple did a superb job with the transparency mode.Being headphones the £1M question is of course how do they sound? The answer is very good indeed. The sound signature is close to the Harman curve so the Airpods Max have a natural and neutral sound. Detail and separation are excellent. The sound stage is good though admittedly not as wide as other headphones I've tried. Bass is punchy but detailed and doesn't sound muddy in the slightest. Treble is tight and highs are handled again with detail. Be aware though that because the sound reproduction is excellent these headphones will severely punish low quality or poorly done recordings.In terms of ease of use, I don't think I've ever had a pair of bluetooth headphones that are as easy to use. Pairing with Apple devices is effortless (I use with an iPhone 12 pro max and a 2019 iPad pro) and switching between Apple devices is seamless and ""just works."" Android or WIndows users will however be missing out on a number of features and are probably best served by other options.One final point - the case that these headphones come with is a horrible joke. Given how carefully designed and engineered the headphones are the case is head scratchingly awful. It feels nice and is made of decent material but it does a very poor job of covering the headphones. I would imagine that everyone who buys Airpods Max will instantly also buy a proper third party hard case to go with them. No idea what Apple were thinking there but the included case is quite literally nearly pointless as an actual case.All in all, are the Airpods Max worth the (relative to the competition) very expensive price? Value is obviously a subjective thing but in terms of build quality, ease of use, convenience and most importantly audio quality these far exceed all of the competition. For me personally they're definitely worth the price and I genuinely find it hard to put them down. 9.5/10 for the Airpods Max, 2/10 at most for the pointless included ""case.""

""The noise reduction along with the special audio truly enhances every piece of music.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 January 2024Colour Name: GreenVerified Purchase
""Is £600 worth it? The ergonomics are fantastic with two buttons, one to switch between passive/active reduction modes, and a well-thought-out notched button for volume adjustment. Sound-wise, it's surprisingly dynamic with a good balance of bass smooth and non-aggressive. Apple should take advantage of this to improve the compression quality of their music service. The midrange and treble are also impressive, with a sound power especially noticeable in genres like movie soundtracks.Conversations are clear and even warm, creating an enjoyable experience. Of course, the integration with iOS is seamless. Yes, it's expensive, but one must compare apples to apples. While sound preferences vary, the unmatched build quality and materials used largely justify the price. Other brands use plastic, so it's not quite the same.""Downsides: the weight, the smart case that fails to protect the headphones (an impractical design choice), average battery life, no included mini-jack cable, and a relatively high price This is not a hi-fi headset as it isn't closest to the source. While a technological marvel developed in a lab with a DSP working digitally for a flattering sound, audiophiles should steer clear. The H1 chips and heavy algorithmic processing make it sound unnatural, overly bass-heavy, deviating from the true nature of hi-fi. In conclusion, if you're a brand enthusiast seeking well-crafted products with a flattering sound and don't mind the price, go for it.

Awesome - probably what God uses! And worth every penny.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 March 2024Colour Name: BlueVerified Purchase
I tested these carefully against the highly rated (and over £200 cheaper) Sony WH-1000XM5.For me there is no comparison - the Apple Airpods max have significantly better sound quality and I find them lots more convenient and intuitive to use than the very fiddly Sonys - not just with Apple devices but also with my Philips TV.I did try the Sony app and equalizer - which helped the sound a bit - but not enough.The volume control knob is genius. I personally love how they stay on (in low power mode?) ready to use when you put them down. Unlike the Sonys - which switch off each time then you have to remember which knob to press and how many seconds you have to hold it down to connect - every time! Battery life hasn't been an issue. Though I normally only use them at home so if they run out of juice I can plug in a long usb lead and keep listening.BRILLIANT for music and BRILLIANT for great sound when watching tv - without disturbing neighbours and without being yourself disturbed by them. Vastly better than the top rated sonos sound bar and better than using optical out to my marantz amp and a big lead across the room to wired philips fidelio headphones - or to some excellent speakers - these apples are far clearer in every case.I didn't know Bluetooth headphones could sound this good!Even MOTD is a revelation with these - besides the commentary you hear the crowd pretty well which adds to the atmosphere.If you get to test these try this :With Qobuz or Tidal, set up Massive Attack's Unfinished SymphonySet volume up to max (at least just to start with)Press PlayWow! - or your money back.(note: like most speakers / earphones the sound quality might well improve after they have run in for a number of hours)I also tested them against Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) (small in-ear buds).These latter also sound great (better than the Sonys) and are keepers - but can't match the Airpods Max for a full deep sound.So my Sonys went back but the Airpods Max and Airpods Pro are awesome.I didn't actually like the Sky Blue colour of the Airpods Max  when they arrived so changed them for space gray.

I recently decided to give the Colour Correcting Purple Toothpaste a try, intrigued by its promises of transforming my teeth into a brighter, whiter shade. Unfortunately, my experience with this product has left me thoroughly dissatisfied and questioning the authenticity of its claims.From the moment I received the toothpaste, I was excited to witness the advertised colour correction and enhancement of my teeth's appearance. However, after multiple uses, I can confidently say that this toothpaste has fallen far short of its lofty promises. Not only did I not observe any positive changes in the colour of my teeth, but I also failed to notice any noticeable improvement in the overall whiteness of my smile.What's most frustrating about this purchase is the stark contrast between the company's extravagant advertising and the reality of the product's performance. The brand invested a significant amount of resources into marketing campaigns, creating high expectations that this toothpaste failed to meet. It's clear to me now that their focus was more on creating a buzz around their product rather than delivering effective results.This product was a complete waste of my resources, and I feel let down by the company's false promises. I would have much preferred that they invested more effort into perfecting the formula rather than allocating so much towards marketing.In conclusion, I cannot recommend the Colour Correcting Purple Toothpaste to anyone seeking real, visible improvements in the colour and appearance of their teeth. The lack of any discernible effect, coupled with the glaring disparity between the product's claims and its actual performance, makes this purchase a regrettable one. Save your money and look elsewhere for toothpaste that truly delivers on its promises.

Ive used it twice now, and im not so sure that it works. I see a difference but very minimal. Im going to use it everyday to see if i notice a clear difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I bought this because of all of the hype around it, but i can say that its better if you just save your money and buy something else.

Temporary colour correction.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2024Verified Purchase
This is a great product to use right before an event, meeting or a date. It will make your teeth visibly whiter but only temporarily (about 3-4 hours). Brush your teeth as normal first and then follow up by using this. My husband has been using this every single day for 4 months and there has been no lasting difference, I've only been using this when going out because I didn't see the point of using it on top of brushing my teeth as per usual if it doesn't have lasting results.

Cannot really see a difference when using it
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2024Verified Purchase
Bought this after watching a few videos online and reading a couple of reviews. It was probably a rushed decision and not a great one. I am not that impressed with the product. The flavour is ok, it specifies on instructions that this is not a toothpaste so you have to use it after brushing your teeth with proper toothpaste. The claim that the purple tone should combat the tone of your teeth and give you a whiter look straightaway is unrealistic. I don’t see any difference, even after using it for several days.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 August 2023Verified Purchase
I was really disappointed with this product and felt like I completely wasted my money. Despite all the hype surrounding it, the product simply didn't deliver on its promises. I had high hopes based on the marketing and reviews, but I ended up getting caught out in what feels like a marketing trap.When I first heard about this product, I was intrigued by the claims it was making. It seemed like a revolutionary solution that could potentially solve a problem I've been dealing with for a while. However, after giving it a try, I quickly realized that it was all just empty promises and exaggerated claims.The worst part is that I trusted the positive reviews and recommendations from others, and that's where I feel like I got caught out. It's frustrating to think that I fell for the hype and ended up with a product that didn't work at all. I wish I had been more skeptical and taken the time to do more research before making a purchase.I want to warn others not to make the same mistake I did. It's easy to be swayed by catchy marketing and glowing reviews, but this experience has taught me the importance of being cautious and doing thorough research before buying into any product's hype. Don't waste your money like I did – look for more reliable sources of information and make an informed decision based on real experiences rather than just flashy advertising.

This is a very good router from eero, good design and easy to setup.I use this with Virgin Media broadband with my Virgin hub 3 on Modem Mode as I wireless used to struggle and I had the WiFi pods from Virgin. After using this router, it has fantastic signal, which even reaches up to the 2nd floor of the house in a loft conversion.The only downside is I don't get a faster speed, but I need to get a eero wifi extender to boost signal and speed.The app is easy to use and you can organise all your devices with profiles, rename and specify what type of device it is connecting to the router. You get alerts when devices connect to your network. Everything is simplified so that anyone can setup and use it.It you want some easy and straight forward I highly recommend the eero devices.

Good replacement for whatever old router but lacks 2.4/5ghz band control
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 April 2024Style Name: RouterConfiguration: 1 unit (up to 140 m²)Verified Purchase
This works great for me as I replaced Tilgin device. Router part of it works as expected, easy to setup, although the software, and specifically the ""wizard"" could have made it s bit easier to get to manual PPPoaE credential screen I needed. Otherwise it first ""tries to connect"" without me providing any details... so what is it expected to accomplish?Anyway more interesting was the access point part for WiFi. In short - it's great for my one bedroom apartment, not different to my previous device, and now supports gigabit, however there is one massive but - in the app you can't specify 2.4 or 5hgz manually. You see - in other devices you would have 2 networks, one for each band. 2.4 is flat but greater range, and some IoT devices only support that. In eero there's only none visible network, and the band thing happens behind the scenes. And this is something you cannot control in any way. As a result, devices which support both bands may be switching between them often, resulting in poor connection stability as during the switch over some lost packets may occur.If eero gave us option to set specific device to only use one band it would result in a more consistent experience. For certain devices it truly doesn't matter but e.g. for working from home where it breaks yournonline meetings briefly it's not.And - lastly - I always wondered how big these things were, especially in comparison to single access point style routers - so here's a photo with a credit card to scale.

Welll what can I say? These have totally solved my WiFi issues at home. I’m with Virgin Media and should be getting 500meg broadband. The best I get from their router is 220 and this is after rebooting it. I then get speeds of around 120 which is appalling. But not any more! Now I have installed these Eero devices I get over 500meg consistently and it was a breeze to set up. Just make sure you put the router into modem mode. The eero app is also fantastic and you can manage all the devices linked to the network. You can name them, pause their connection or even block them if you need to. I haven’t experienced any issues so far and have been recommending these to family and friends. The only additional item I purchased was an Ethernet splitter box as the eero’s only have two ports. One of which you plug into the router so that only leaves one. But the splitter I purchased solved this and was only about £12. So if you are not sure whether these will help with your WiFi then from my experience it certainly will!

Using the app make it easy to set up no need to add all your devices as you can use your old routers ssid and password so everything stays connected. Have no more dead spots with the main unit downstairs and the extender upstairs. If you have the new echo's they also work as an extender. The only downside is the hardwired ports there are only 2 on the main unit and you have to use 1 of them to connect to your isp router, you don't get any ports on the extender either. Took me a while to decide to get them but so glad I did.

Amazon promote this as a top end all encompassing WiFi Mesh system.Having installed this as an upgrade from a now defunct competitor product I was hopeful that this item woul meet all demands and need.How wrong I was. Immediately following installation setting up the 2nd linked device had to be within 6ft or a ‘weak signal’ error message occurred. The same exactly for the 3rd device. Contextually I live in a 1930’s detached 3 bed with some thick internal walls. Where previously I had no issues with another competitor, until their software ‘upgrade’ this causes me nothing but endless headaches. Ring Doorbell - within 8 ft of the home hub - ‘weak signal’6ft high tech aquarium running with smart plugs - ‘weak signal’ despite being within 2ft of the 2nd linked device.This item will be returned& I would advise anyone considering this option to really ask yourself if it’s worth the disappointment before making the purchase. A really poor product sadly.

I have 3 of these hooked up to my virgin router in bridged mode. Work really well. The 1st one is wired upstairs in my office and transmits at full speed, I then have the 2nd one in the hallway downstairs which transmits at around 400mb, the 3rd one in the chain is in a room at the edge of house at transmits at 250mb which is great considering how far apart they are. The house has solid walls so good result all round. Reliable too! I could wire the 3rd one to further improve overall speed, might do this but it's good enough at the moment.

This cream ticked all the boxes for me.Both myself & my husband have ecsma his is more serious than mine.I wanted an aqueous cream that would lock-in moisture, one that could be used over our normal prescriptive treatment cream for an extra moisture boost.Plus this cream is free from SLH and other nasties which ticked the boxes for us big time.You can use as little or as much as you want.  It does not dry into the skin but provides a deeply moisturising locking in affect.My skin was soft, hydrated and stopped flaking, it was soothing.I use this cream on my face to lock-in the moisture and protect from harsh weather that played havoc with the ecsma on my face.This cream performs admirably and is reasonably priced and has nothing irritating nor nasty in it. Especially No SLS!I would highly recommend this aqueous cream, it does what it says, plus I could really put it on thick of an evening and use it as a wash too!  Good stuff!

Trueforce indeed
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2022Style Name: PlayStation | PCPattern Name: G923 TRUEFORCEVerified Purchase
What a top notch piece of kit for the price. The trueforce feedback is spot on detecting bumps in the road and colisions with other cars, the range of the accelerator gives you so much control over your throttle that making minor adjustments to keep your line is an absolute joy that just boosts your confidence when cornering. The best thing is the learning curve is practically none existent cause I found my self doing perfect laps after my first 3 races of practice. It's and astonishing game changer for sure. But I would realy recommend that you invest in a racing chair simply for the foot peddles to fix to, cause the break peddle is kinda stiff and hard to press with out it sliding across ur floor. I hear there's a way to fix it by removing a piece inside but I don't like wasting a good warranty myself. just incase.Overall though it's and excellent product, well built and helps of fun  👍 😀(Edit)Gt7 works perfectly plug and playGrid Ledgends works perfectly plug and playAssetto Corsa Competizione, what the duck went wrong there. The cars are un-controllable to say the least, there is no dead zone, no auto re-center, the feedback sends u out of control when ever u do finaly get the car going in a straight line ( only at high speeds) and the turning angles are way off. I no this is not the wheels fault its the games creators so don't let this put u off if u try this game with it. The game just stinks

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2021Style Name: PlayStation | PCPattern Name: G923 TRUEFORCEVerified Purchase
I ordered the standard version at first, but it was faulty because it was VERY noisy when the wheel was at centre position. When I got the refund I decided to get the trueforce model and I have to say it feels better and so far it's not as noisy although it does depend on the game a lot.I have already shaved a few seconds of off every race I have done so far... I am no pro, but it's definitely more fun and easier to control the vehicle then a console controller.Pros.Feels pretty good.Built well, even thought it's mostly plastic.The calibration seems quieter then the non-trueforce model.It was faster to set up and does not have the PS3/ps4-PC switch.Cons.Still noisy, probably because it's plastic and hollow.The brake is still STUPID stiff, but it's easy to MOD.The software leaves much to be desired as it doesn't even know what game I am playing 80% of the time.Still had to manually install the driver.Overall if you are wondering if the price difference is worth it... I will say no, no it's not.But it is fun so...I have had a driving license for 26 years with full no claims, no accidents and I was a multidrop driver and a 7.5 tonne freezer truck driver for a while. If that makes any difference.  :)

Heavy break pedal, not for kids
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2024Style Name: PlayStation | PCPattern Name: G923 TRUEFORCEVerified Purchase
The steering wheel is fantastic. It has a nice set of buttons, good grippy wheel and excellent force feedback. The shifter paddles are very precise. The whole thing is well made and feel sturdy.The pedals are fine. The break pedal needs a lot of force to depress right to the bottom and my son and wife cannot do that. (The wheel was not for them anyway, so it doesn't bother me). But if anyone is going to buy this, I would caution you. First try it before buying. And unfortunately you cannot adjust the pedal strength without dismantling the whole thing to change the spring inside.All in all it's a great product but may not suit everyone. If only Logitech made the break pedal adjustable it will suit almost everyone.

It's a very nice upgrade to an old dodgy G29. The wheel is much smoother, and responsiveness is much sharper. It feels like I can save a few more slides.Generally the same as the G29 but it does feel like an upgrade and more premium. At first touch, it felt like an arcade machine set up.With the 30% off Amazon, I would recommend and with instalments, it was hard not to purchase.I would recommend

Amazing steering wheel. Really well built and the force feedback is good. The only criticism is the break pedal is quite stiff but after while you get use it it. All in all can't fault it. Would recommend to anyone.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2021Style Name: PlayStation | PCPattern Name: G923 TRUEFORCEVerified Purchase
It feels electronic. I've since learnt there are wheels that don't have this issue. Its noisy if you're trying to play in the morning and not wake anyone. You can circumvent this by turning off feedback. Feels fun with a vr headset though. If it's your first wheel it's ok. If it's your second I'd spend a little extra for the not so electronic feely ones. Sturdy build quality. Strong feedback. LED is cool. Pedals are solid. But a little close to each other. The true force just didn't have much of an impact. I owned a Driving force pro some years back and it impressed me. The only difference, seems to me, this has some light vibrations going on in the background. That just don't translate very well. Not sure if it's the game devs, not doing a good job, or the hardware itself. Underwhelming so far. Maybe that'll change.

Shocking
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 February 2024Verified Purchase
I bought this for my sons 18th, ive always used amazons refurbished phones if they are excellent quality and never, ever had a problem, until today. He has tried to charge it but the charger wouldnt work, i assumed theyd sent a faulty charging cable so although slightly miffed, we have literally a dozen iphone cables as we all have 1phones 10 and above. So i gave him my cable and it worked straight away, however by tea time ghe battery was almost flat without much over use so again i gave him my cable but it didnt work, i unplugged it, turned it over, plugged it back in but nothing. I immediately plugged it in my iphone 11 and it started charging straight away. I gave him the cable back and asked him to try it again but again nothing, it wouldnt charge. So i gave him his dads charger and it charged straight away, i was starting to get a bit worried and within seconds it stopped charging, we unplugged it, turned it around again, plugged it back in and again it started charging but then immediately stopped. I gave him my other sons working charger but that did nothing so i gave him my daughters and that starting charging. We checked back half an hr later and again it had stopped charging. These are all perfectly good and working charging cables but they will not work with this phone or only work for a short amount of time. If this is the trouble we are having on day 1, i dread to think what itll b like weeks down the line so i thought instead of dreading the hassle i know we’re going to have weeks or months down the line, ill just send it back. So i am very disappointed with this phone but even more so when i realised i have to pay to send it back myself. I havent sent many items back to amazon but whenever i have, its never cost me a penny. I name the post office where i want to send it from and i dont even need to print my own labels, they do everything and its free so for this to actually charge me returning a faulty  item right from the very first day has miffed me no end. In fact im more than miffed im really angry. It was sold through a seller but it came through prime so im going to email someone from amazon and see what they do as i shouldnt have to pay to send something back thats arrived faulty through prime.I will update when i get a refund and let you know if that was as easy as it should be because i have a feeling this is going to be a nightmare.

I was really shocked at the review ratings of the phone until i realised its all related to the typo error of amazon stating it was a dual sim handset. Amazon were really good with providing me with a solution for not recieving a dual sim handset, and i can imagine an employee somewhere has got a slap on the wrist for the error.however the phone itself is phenomenal, and the update to the phone has erradicated all the bugs and glitches someone mentions. i did find that the update did not get pushed over the air, and i did need to download the huawei sync software onto my pc and update my phone that way. i did this within a few days of recieving the phone. since updating the phone has been faultless and i do not miss my samsung galaxy at all.It is a super fast smartphone, with smooth interface. the menus and themes are all customisable and theres something for everyones taste, although i imagine the fact that it cant be rooted will be an issue to some. i however have no interest in doing so.  the camera features are out of this world compared to other flagships, and the AI built into this phone really boosts what it is capable of.i like the notch compared with the s10+, and find i dont notice it at all sometimes ans its very small and central. the screen is good too, and really adapts well to save battery life. speaking if which, the battery is my most favourite part of this phone, as it easily lasts me 2 full days. i like the size of the phone as i can grip it well, although the screen is tall. the breathing crystal version of the handset is a talking point with anyone who sees it, but i do dislike that the camera sticksout quite a bit.all unboxing videos before release showed a preinstalled screen protector and clear back case included, so i was pretty dissapointed that the Uk releases didnt have them included. but i did have my trusted spigen hybrid crystal case ready before I even recieved the phone. ive bought a 3.5 to usb c adapter to use my existing earphones, although it would've been nice to have them included in the box, although a usb c earphone was included.  people need to stop complaining about the headphone jack not included, as going forward all future flagship phones will no longer carry them.i highly recommended buying the huawei p30 pro and cannot think of any reason why someone who wants to buy a flagship should hold back when compared with other competion. the only negative i must mention is that if you want to expand the 128gb memory you need to buy a different format of memory card called nm card by huawei, and it is very expensively priced compared to micro sd cards. most people may be more than satisfied with the already large internal storage though. also ive been having trouble finding a decent glass screen protector for the curved screen thats case friendly too. i must've gone through 8 different ones already and still searching. although i can imagine that being the issue with all curved screen phones.

This is  upgrade to my huawei mate 20 pro, that all of  sudden stopped working effectively. It was switching itself on and off. But I had the pro 20 for maybe 6 years so was at the end of its use really. I stuck with Huawei as I find their phones quick, uncomplicated and smart. This phone is almost identical to the mate 20 pro, except the camera is positioned differently. I got the phone up and running quickly by use the clone app, and moving what I wanted to move over. I paid £330 for the Pro 30 which IMO was a bargain considering I paid £1K for the mate 20 pro on prep order when it came out. Good little phone and I believe from research, the last models to still incude Google.

I know all the rubbish about Huawei being blocked from using Google apps on future phones, but this phone still has full access to Google Apps and updates as designed and licenced before the issues with certain countries trade wars! Phone is extremely quick and easy to use, EMUI gets a lot of flack but I find easy to use and coming from IOS a lot of similaritys make it feel familiar and easy to use. For those who do not like it's IOS look you can enable the app drawers which a lot of people dont mention in thier hate of EMUI.The Battery gets me through 3-4 days of light use with no issues and putting on the ultr low power mode to enable phone/textand email only really extends the battry if needed.The camera is AMAZING, no complaints. the pictures a clear and detailed and the zoom is amazing, getting some good photos zoomed in. The 50x zoom allows you to identify far away details but does loose quality, but the 5x, 10x are stunning and even up to around 20x hybrid zoom is acceptable. Night photos are simply amazing, a dark night photo outside in a dimly lit street gives amazing detail, light and can identify colours of cars, grass, etc in street compared to iphone i had before where same photo gave little light, virtually no colour, detail and lots of noise at same light level.The transfer from phone software made the transfer of photos, contacts and settings from the iphone seamless.Games run really well and the screen is colourful and bright and resolution is more than good enough though lower than rivals. Can turn down resolution to a lower one to give extra battery life if needed although never really needed to do this. Sadly a lack of stereo speakers and Headphone socket let it down a little but the mono speaker is loud enough if not the best.

These are a nice addition to your airfryer.  But silicone is not a very good heat conductor so may take a little longer for the food to heat up.  However, they do help to keep crumbs from falling into the bottom of the drawers and help to keep the drawers cleaner.  Nice to have if you cook a lot of messy food, ie bbq sauce coated, breadcrumbs etc.  they are a very nice quality and good value as you get 2 for the price.  Easy to clean in hot soapy water.

I bought these at the same time as my 2 drawer Ninja air fryer. The silicone is a good thickness and they feel good quality. They do the job they were made for! I do have a few gripes however.• The grey coloured tray discoloured pretty quickly. This may not be the case if you have a dishwasher but as we do not I struggled to keep the sides and handles free of baked on dirt after a few uses.• The handles are too thin and flop around a lot when trying to fish the tray out of the drawer.• These trays are about 3/4 the size of the drawer on the Ninja and so much space is wasted. I can only fit one chicken breast into a silicone tray when without I could easily fit two.These gripes are certainly worth not having to clean out the air fryer drawers as often.

At first glance, when unpacked, it looks a little flimsy — being built of small-bore aluminium tubing and plastic. But when it's set up (in just 2 or 3 minutes) it turns out to be quite study, although I doubt it would survive much mistreatment.It holds a lot of clothes, and a sheet can simply be placed over the whole array.I use it manually, switching it on and off as required.The humidity in the room rises by a few percent, but in Winter with the central heating on that's maybe not a bad thing.I also bought some of the accessories to go with it (the pegs, along with the shelving on which to lay woolens while they dry ready for ironing).It seems a little expensive for what it is, but it functions perfectly — so I'm happy.Will it last a long time? I don't know, as I've only had it for a month or two, so we shall see.

Excellent buy!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2024Verified Purchase
We're soon moving to a smaller house where space is limited, so I decided to buy this electric dryer, not only to save space, but to save on the electric bill, too. I'd seen that these have been highly recommended recently, so decided to take the plunge. I'm so pleased I did!I chose this particular model because it looked more sturdy than some of the others and offered lots of drying space. It's one of the best purchases I've made in a long time!Even though we haven't moved yet, we've already been using it, and it's brilliant. It takes a full wash load of clothes or towels, and a full set of bedding. For our king size bedding, we have to fold it, but even then, it still dries in good time.The ability to set how many hours you want the dryer on for and just leave it is so easy and worry-free. You can also delay when you want the dryer to come on, though I've had no need to use that option.It really is so easy to set up and put away, and is very sturdy once in place, and has several configurations, depending on how much washing you need to put on it. The only negative I can find is that the power cable could really do with being longer, which was a point made in the other reviews I read, so I was aware of the issue before I bought it.

REVIEW GOD4.0 out of 5 stars
A Drying Solution for All Seasons ☀️🌧️👕
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 March 2024Verified Purchase
The Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-Tier Heated Clothes Airer is a game-changer for anyone who struggles with drying laundry in the unpredictable British weather. This versatile and space-saving drying solution deserves a round of applause (and a few well-placed emojis)! 👏🙌Let's start with the positives: 💚- No more waiting for sunny days! This airer dries your clothes quickly and gently, even on the rainiest of days. 🌧️- With 21 meters of drying space and a 15kg weight capacity, it can handle even the largest of laundry loads. 💪- The thermostatically controlled, lightweight aluminum frame is kind to delicate fabrics like satin and silk. 👚- The eye-level control panel and built-in timer (up to 12 hours) make it a breeze to use and plan your day. ⏰- Folding down to a mere 9cm deep, this airer is a space-saving champion, easily tucked away when not in use. 🏡Now, for the not-so-positive points: 💔- At 7.7kg, it's a bit on the heavier side, which could make it challenging to move around frequently. 🏋️‍♀️- While economical, the 300W power consumption might still add up over extended use periods. 💷- The cord length of 1.35M might not be long enough for some households, potentially limiting placement options. 🔌Overall, the Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-Tier Heated Clothes Airer is a versatile and clever solution for indoor drying, especially in the UK's unpredictable climate. 🌈 With its space-saving design, gentle drying capabilities, and convenient features, it's a worthy investment for those seeking a hassle-free laundry experience. Just be mindful of its weight and potential energy consumption. 🤔 But hey, at least you'll never have to worry about rain-soaked clothes again! 🌂

Super solution for drying clothes in winter – easy, quick, neat and a great investment!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2016Verified Purchase
I'm so pleased with this purchase! Can't believe how quickly and nicely my clothes dry now, it's really helpful for those who live in a flat and struggle to dry clothes in the winter months. My flat is in a very old, draught-prone building and so to dry clothes we had been rotating them on radiators (not good for the room or clothes) or on chairs and it would take 2-3 days to dry anything in winter. Now, I can put a wash on the night before and have dry clothes for work the next morning – bliss!My living room used to spend half the working week looking like I'd constructed a blanket fort every time I washed my sheets. When people came round, I'd have to remember to move my pants from the dining chairs so they could sit down. Not any more!! Now I feel like I am really adulting.Best points…• Easy to assemble – the shelves fold out very intuitively and it takes seconds to put together each time.• Ready to use – from taking out of the box to hanging out clothes – minutes! Great for me, I hate assembling products.• Lightweight – you can move it from room to room easily.• Safe – the bars are heated, but they never get 'too hot' so that it would cause an accident. We don't have kids or pets, but I might pop it in a separate room if we did just in case. Having said that, I've grabbed the bars a couple of times by mistake to move it, and it's definitely not hot enough to injure anyone. I expect if you had a pet they would just want to curl up underneath to sleep!• Sturdy enough – as someone else said, if your kid (or husband!) runs into it it's likely to fall over, but otherwise it's sturdy enough for the job!• Lots of shelf space – can fit one large load of washing, and that's considering that larger, heavier pieces need to be laid over more bars. Sheets are a bit trickier, but a bit of rotation in the middle of drying time sorts that out.• Quick dry time – I've been putting the timer (see below) on for 8 hours at about 6pm, then clothes are dry by the morning. I should mention that I didn't buy the official (rather expensive) cover, like other reviewers I just place a large dry bed sheet over the top of the whole thing and this speeds up the drying time like nobody's business!• Big, but neat – So yes this thing is pretty large (138 x 79.5 x 9.5cm), but it's actually a lot neater than using a couple of old-fashioned clothes airers pushed up against a radiator, with a few chairs spread around the room for good luck. It's great to have all clothes drying in one, neat wardrobe-shaped item. You can even cover it up with an Indian-style throw and pretend it's part of the decor (!).• Bright 'on' light – when it's on, it's obvious!Things to think about…• Price – yes, it's quite expensive and we resisted buying one of these on that basis. For us, the convenience offered and frustration at drying clothes indoors eventually outweighed the cost and now I actually have one, I wouldn't go back at all. Save up if you need to and invest in one, that's my advice! Once you have it, it's cheap to run and you'll save money heating your rooms, too.• Timer – the built-in timer isn't great, so I bought a basic timer with options for 15 min, 30 min, up to 4 or 8 hours. This is more useful for clothes drying and I would recommend it as a fairly cheap partner product (about £8) 
ANSMANN AES-1 Zero Watt Energy Saving Timer Plug
• Short cable – there's not much scope for putting this further away from a plug socket without an extension cable, the cable length is I'd estimate 1.2m.Overall – I love this product, would highly recommend. Put away £20 a month over the summer and you'll have enough to buy it next winter! Adulting score – 10/10

Difficult to dispense
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 October 2023Scent Name: RosemarySize Name: 150 ml (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
It smells amazing. I have previously purchased a different brand of Rosemary oil from Amazon, and it has worked brilliantly. So, I thought I would give this brand a try as it had a lot of positive reviews and was on offer.The problem is that there is a little plastic stopper, under the screw cap. This stopper looks as though it has a small hole in the top, but it does not.I therefore tried to make one with a saving needle, but it would not go through the stiff plastic, so I used a small pair of nail scissors to make a tiny hole.BUT, the plastic stopper would not fit into the top of the bottle - it actually fits inside the bottle cap and stops the oil leaking in transit. So the bottle has an open neck, and being glass you cannot give it a tiny squeeze to dispense a drop or two of oil, which is all that is needed. I tried to 'pour' the tiniest amount into my hand, but it is impossible, you cannot get less than half a teaspoon or so - so I put most of it on my legs, and used the residue on my hands to out a tiny amount on my hair.Due to this problem, using this oil is going to work out much more expensive than the previous smaller, plastic bottle I purchased and for this reason I will not be buying this brand again. It is a pity, as it does seem to be good quality and smells so good...

Good cheap replacement
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2024Verified Purchase
Bought this for my 14 year old daughter as her phone ""broke"" somehow........  I was at the gym dad, listening to music then I looked down and the screen was broken!  I don't know how it happened!The phone was an old Samsung J6+ so it was due a change , it was getting a bit glitchy and as the price of a new screen was at least 50 quid I thought why not get a new one.I was not going to be spending hundreds of pounds on an S22/23/24 or iPhone etc so I gave her a few options that all had similar specs and she picked this one.  So far she is very impressed with it.  it will not be able to keep up with the top of the range models, running on brand new processors etc, but for her, and the average user, it is spot on.Battery lasts all day most days, camera seems pretty decent for a mid level phone, functionality is pretty good and as quick as expected.  Nothing bad to report with the phone itself at the moment.FYI--- It does not come with a charger just a USB-C to USB-C cable so please keep that in mind as you will not be able to use a standard charger it will have to be a USB-C connection.  These are only about 5-10 quid so nothing major.Overall I would definitely recommend one of these if you are looking to spend about 120-150 on a mid level Samsung phone.  I have a S22 and this A14 can keep up with it on most aspects and even beats it on the battery life.  I was tempted to swap my S22 with her A14 as the s22 is starting to annoy me.  The only reason why I didn't is the size on the A14, it is pretty big at 6.5"".  Doesn't fit in my pocket very comfortably if I am being honest.  if that is not an issue for you and you love huge phones at quite a low cost I would recommend one on these.  if you want similar ""real world"" specs but want to spend another 200 quid get an S22, but I would not recommend one of those........My partner also has a J6+ that she is keeping alive, but I think I might replace that with an A14 when it does finally die off........

One of the Best Budget Phone to Date.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2024Verified Purchase
If your looking for the best budget phone that does what you need, you have come to the right place! This phone is very cheap considering the prices of other phones, It has a 60hz display that doesn't look awful, contains most features any other more expensive samsung phone would have, has a decent battery life (can last a day or 2 depending on how power intensive the apps you use are) and a decent camera with stabilisation for this price range (the camera is decent enough that I use it to record my youtube videos and they come out fairly good). The only drawbacks with this phone which may be bad depending on what you need the phone to do is that there is no NFC (contactless) on the phone meaning you can't pay contactless or use wireless charging and the fact that the phone DOES NOT come with a charging adapter but rather only a charging cable with USB-C at either end meaning you may need to buy a USB-C adapter separately or use a different cable with USB at one end and USB-C at the other end connected to a USB adapter just to plug it in to the wall. Other than that the phone has worked wonders for me! I Would certainly rate it one of the best budget phones out there currently! It is so good that I wrote this review using this phone.

I worked it out that I would have paid more than double for the phone compared to purchasing it outright. This is what I did and together with a £5:monthly SIM card I am more than happy. All aspects of the phone are easy to use and work well..  I thoroughly recommend this phone.  It does everything that my daughters very expensive phone does!

It's basic and slow
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2023Verified Purchase
Wow yes this phone and nice and cheap but oh my it's insanely slow. Keyboard doesn't keep up with you. If you get a message it takes a while to show up. Honestly I've never been so frustrated with such a slow phone. It takes a while for apps to open too, don't even think about playing games on it because it's just too slow. It even came up and said phone is running slow, please reset. It took 10 minutes for the phone to come back on.Battery life is goodCamera is alright for the priceIt's a good size phone

This toy is great! The quality of the product is of a high standard. The material feels so soft and premium for the price. Has plenty of settings and different modes. I like how you can use only one part of the toy at a time and change each mode and intensity separately. Comes in a very cute yet discrete box and I love the storage pouch it comes with! It doesn’t seem too loud either which often seems to be an issue with these toys.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2024Size Name: OG PRO 2Colour Name: TealVerified Purchase
I wasn't sure on this initially as I've tried a similar thing before and struggled with the shape, but this works really well. It's very flexible, meaning you can adjust it to fit the angle that's just right for your personal anatomy. The option to control suction and vibration independently of each other is great, and you can mix up a combo of sensations to see what works for you or to try something different.  And the remote control for a hands free operation option, or someone else doing it, is a great touch. It's also easy to clean, and I like that it came with a storage bag.

We bought last year's on sale at Easter as we had bought many novelty advent calendars & not really been impressed. But I was blown away with them so didn't hesitate to purchase them this year although it was a struggle to get them as I think the movie made everyone want these this year.They haven't been opened as we weren't able to get them before Dec 1 but still couldn't resist buying them. The kids think they're not getting them so can't wait ti see their faces on Xmas morning & also this year's selection of characters & designs..We know they are small but sturdy, well made, colourful & have plenty of detail on them.

Very useful cleaning tool - could do with some improvements though
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 November 2023Item Package Quantity: 1Verified Purchase
Used this today for the first time. I mainly needed it for my shower enclosures, they were tiled with ridged tiles which are awful for harbouring soap scum which turns to pink mould if it is left for more than a week without deep cleaning, and I was going through so many ""magic eraser"" type sponges that it was becoming very expensive.I also wanted to deep clean the seals around the shower doors etc. I used my own batteries because the ones supplied with the device didn't seem very powerful.It comes with 4 heads, the largest of which is about the size of a Babybel cheese. It also comes with a ""kind of"" pointed brush but I would really like to see a small detail thinner longer brush that gets right into cracks and crevices, because all 4 of the brush heads are too big for this.It does seem quite powerful but your hand does get sore from the vibrations if you are holding it for any length of time.You can slide the ""ON"" button all the way forward to keep it on instead of pressing it, which is good.It really helped to remove the scum from the tiles and got right into most of the grooves. The big brush is still pretty small so it does take time, but this is a dinky handheld device and I'm sure you can buy bigger more expensive ones if you plan on using it to clean large areas.It's easy to change the brush heads by twisting to the side and pulling off.I've seen people using these online to clean their taps etc - I wouldn't recommend this unless you want to end up with badly scratched stainless steel/brass etc. The brushes are reasonably firm and I would suspect could scratch the finish.I'm sure there are lots of jobs around the home this tool could be useful for.Recommended, wish it came with a small detail brush though!

I would’ve preferred it not to have been battery operated.Most definitely would recommend as a go to product in your home or maybe your car. A fair price, easy to assemble and easy to use.However I would like to know if you can purchase new brush heads?

However, the A53 has proven to be a significant upgrade from my trusty M31.One standout feature of the A53 that has left me thoroughly impressed is its front-facing fingerprint reader. Unlike the M31, which had its fingerprint sensor on the back, the A53's placement on the front feels more intuitive and convenient. It's a small change, but it makes a big difference in day-to-day usage.Another area where the A53 shines is its screen clarity. Whether I'm streaming Netflix or watching YouTube videos, the display quality is top-notch. The visuals are crisp and vibrant, providing an immersive viewing experience that's hard to match in this price range.In terms of performance, the A53 has proven to be noticeably faster and more responsive than my M31. Apps load swiftly, multitasking is a breeze, and overall, it just feels snappier in everyday use. This improved performance has added to my overall satisfaction with the phone.To complete my experience, I paired the A53 with a Spigen Rugged Armor Phone Case. This combination not only provides excellent protection but also enhances the overall look and feel of the phone. It's become the perfect setup for me, ensuring my device stays safe while still looking stylish.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy A53 has proven to be a worthy upgrade from my Galaxy M31. With its front-facing fingerprint reader, impressive screen clarity, and enhanced performance, it has exceeded my expectations. If you're in the market for a budget-friendly smartphone with excellent features, the A53 is definitely worth considering.

I had a a52, which I upgraded to a note 20 ultra. This was bought to replace that...tells you everything you need to know about this phone.  This phone does everything I need it too.  The battery life is brilliant, the fingerprint scanner works when I need it to.  There is an occasional lag with apps, but no worse than the flagship phone I was using.  Pleased with this especially as I traded my old phone in for slightly more than I paid for this....great value

If you're even slightly OCD about sound itself, you need these
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 April 2019Verified Purchase
These headphones made me cry. More on that later.They come in a sturdy wood-ish type box - not posh polished wood, but sturdy enough and covered with dark brown lining. The phones are nestled in protective grey foam, cut to the shape of the phones to keep them safe during transit. A manual accompanies them, although I just dived in and started listening.I love the sound of a piano so I had plenty of classical themed music to run through these 600s.First up was an old Naxos 1980s Beethoven Piano Concerto No.1 CD. Hmm. The sound was dull across the entire range. The playing is fantastic though and led me to buy the sheet music, which I never could play. To be fair it never sounded great through any headphones, but I was expecting some kind of magic.Let's try something recorded more recently. Second up was Yundi Li's ""The Art of Yundi"" (a fantastic collection of piano pieces - many new to me a few months ago). Flipping heck! What a difference a good recording/sound engineer makes! I heard nuances in individual notes I'd not heard before. I even heard accidentals/accent notes I'd not noticed before. The clarity from top to bottom was simply outstanding. Sparkling brilliance in the upper registers and warm dark sonorous tones lower down.My love of piano music led me to buy an electric piano, 15+ years ago now. It went ""pop"" a year or so ago and died on me. I was sad but kept it as it's handy for my home theater speakers. When I've saved up I'll buy another.Back to Yundi. Liszt's Rigoletto was one of the pieces that was new to me. I must have played it 100 times on the train to work, using my mobile + headphones. It's an addictive piece and I know it quite well now. Again there were notes/timbres/nuances that sprang into life, as though rescued from the cracks that lesser headphones would leave behind. It was like listening to a completely new recording. Rigoletto draws you in slowly, then makes you addicted with its clever ever complicating recapitulation, then exits the stadium with magnificent massive virtuoso chords crashing down the keyboard. And then silence. But there isn't. For a few seconds through these headphones you can hear the soundboard and frame of the piano ring and undulate as the brilliance of Liszt, through Yundis fingers, evapourates into the ether. That little piece of magic made me cry. It made me look at my beloved piano, now senza voce, and want to play it. But I could not, ever again. It made me remember all the good times, the bad times, the frustrations, the rare accomplishments but most of all my love of sound itself. Welcome back, my friend.Let's not get too emotive - it's just a pair of headphones after all. However, music makes us emotional.Third up was Bachs Toccata & Fugue in D Minor. These phones pick up everything, including quirks of an old air powered Church organ. You could almost hear the beast breathing through its nostrils. At full pelt in the ""fff"" passages with every single bank of notes from foot to teeth being tormented these phones did struggle. The music got lost as if overwhelmed. To be fair it's a cruel test as none of my headphones ever succeeded either. You have a huge Church organ pumping gallons of air to make those fat boy pipes play and expect a little piece of tech to replicate that? We need to be realistic in our expectations. However, the different registers/instruments the organ sounded were simply sublime through these. Really sweet.Fourth up was a new addiction of mine. Liszt Hungarian Rhapsodies. Played by the brilliant George Cziffra. Recorded in the early 1970s I didn't expect much from this CD. In fact I was worried these 'phones might highlight the fact microphones were not as sensitive then, tape noise, that kind of thing. Oh my - what a blast! Yet again I'm hearing those accidental notes (not really accidental - they are very brief deliberate embellishments and fiendishly difficult to play without whacking). Yet again I feel like my ears have been cleansed or I'm listening to a new digitally remastered release. Brilliant.These 'phones give your ears exactly what's on the plate. If it's a poor recording then they won't make it better. If it's a good one then your ears, brain, body and soul will be overjoyed. Yep that's the word. The music I have gave me joy. Now it's joy++. Overjoyed.These initially feel tight to wear, but soon you realise you've gotten used to slack ill fitting headgear. They encompass the ear (unless you are Vulcan) and fit nicely against the head, instead of pressing into parts of the ear. I find them very comfortable. After a few minutes you forget you are wearing them.My first pair of ""opens"". Highly recommended. Closed gives me that ""sea shell"" experience of hearing my own bloodstream or something. Plus my ears now remain cool, they weigh less and I feel part of the environment rather than in some sensory deprivation chamber. A huge plus when it comes to listening to a concerto where you want to be in the audience, not isolated.Having listened to much piano tonight I noticed sound engineers don't follow any particular rule regarding left/right; some make you the listener - you are facing the piano being played so high notes come through the left ear and low notes through the right. Very disconcerting if you are a player. As the player you hear low through left and high through right. I'm not a player, but have tried and like to be ""in the seat"" when I'm doing air piano.Others seem to give a cross-fade which is even more disconcerting.For the wrong-way-round listener experience I found a fantastic tweak you can do to these HD 600s. If you absolutely want the player experience where low=down and high=up then make the following adjustments to these cans. Yes I know these are very expensive, but the modification is reversible:1. Take them off2. Put them on the wrong way roundImmediately you are transported from audience to player. As these phones are symmetrically flexible they feel just as comfortable either way around.Worth the money? If you're going to do something, do it once and do it properly.With a frequency response of 12Hz-40500Hz it should cover most needs. Oh nearly forgot! So many questions out there about impedance. 32/80/300/600 Ohms. Will my X phones work in a Y thing? There's lots of ""info"" about needing to buy a specialist headphone amp if > 32 ohms.These HD 600s are 300 ohms. I have them plugged into my Denon 4300 AVR. My CD is a Panasonic Blue Ray player. They are more than loud enough at 5/10. 3/10 would be my listening preference.These just tell it like it is to be fair. No magic. No pseudo science. Simple transparent acoustic honesty.No regrets at all.

HD600 and HD650 are still very good
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 October 2011Verified PurchaseSennheiser HD 600 - Open Monitoring Headphones
The HD600 was originally introduced as a development of the very successful HD580.  It was rated as one of the best headphones of its time and I think it is still very, very good.So how do they sound?  Compared to cheaper headphones they impress with the added clarity and dynamics they reveal in the music.  They are generally smooth and easy to listen to without the abrasive harshness you find in some competitors products.  They have a well deserved reputation for being one of the most neutral sounding headphones you can buy in their price range. No particular frequency stands out as emphasized. The only slight criticism is that the soundstage is a little narrow.  By this I mean the music is more in the middle of your head than some more expensive headphones.Over the years they have attracted much praise and a little criticism which I will briefly review.1) Firstly, they are said to roll off in the bass a little too early.  To my ears this is true for really low bass frequencies but mostly they sound well balanced in the lower registers. A little more punch and impact would be nice but they could not really be called bass-light.  Even so for those who like a strong authoritative bass you may want to look elsewhere.2) In the upper midrange/lower treble they have been criticized for having a slight rise in their response.  I find this is only very mild and not objectionable.  In fact the midrange quality is one of the best aspects of this headphone that reveals details you would not normally notice.3) Some think treble frequencies possess a veil that limits clarity. Compared to the best headphones I find the very extreme treble may roll off a touch, but this means they are less likely to induce listener fatigue.  The treble is a good balance between sounding smooth and yet having enough attack and vibrancy. However, on poor recordings some may find the HD600s can sound a little bright (i.e. give an emphasis to treble sounds).Comfort is very good with large squashy earpads that cover the whole ear.  Weight is very reasonable so they can be worn for long periods without feeling heavy. They do clamp your head a little tightly at first but are very comfortable once you get used to this. Resist any temptation to bend the headband!  A few weeks of use and you will not notice the extra pressure.These are open-backed headphones which means air can pass through the back of the ear cup to the speaker element. This means there is no sealed enclosure and sound waves cannot cause distortions inside the headphones.  The disadvantage is there is no isolation from external sounds. You will be able to hear everything happening in your environment just as if you never had them on. Similarly anyone sitting fairly close to you will hear what you are listening to. Therefore, apart from the large physical size, these are not suited to wearing whilst commuting!Quality of construction is more than adequate and spare parts are readily available. However, these are not the kind of headphones to abuse.  The metal grilles will dent easily so treat them with some care.  The cable is 3 metres long and is a bit thin, but it does have a very nifty built-in adapter to convert it to a 3.5mm socket. Although Sennheiser have improved this from the early examples, unplugging the cable from the headphones frequently can lead to the connectors becoming loose and making intermittent contact.By modern standards their impedance is high at 300 ohms. This means anything portable that is battery powered like a phone may struggle to drive them to a high enough volume. Most mains powered equipment will probably have enough power, but these headphones will either reveal poor quality or just not perform as well as expected if you partner them with mediocre equipment.  If you listen to audio via a computer get a good sound card or a headphone amp or amp/DAC combined.It is worth noting that the condition of the earpads has a noticeable effect on these headphones, causing them to sound muffled and lacking in clarity. If they look a bit misshapen and lose their firmness, consider buying new ones.  Choose original Sennheiser spare parts as some third-party products, although cheaper, typically do not sound or feel the same.The HD650 was introduced in 2003 and looks very similar.  Gone is the marble effect finish which to many will be an improvement.  The cable is thicker and has a separate adapter for 3.5mm sockets.  This cable will also fit the HD600 and is certainly more durable.  The headband cushioning is shaped slightly differently but the earpads are identical.  From a comfort perspective they are indistinguishable. In 2020 the HD600 adopted the same headband as the HD650 and dispensed with the marble effect finish.The sound of the HD650 is similar to the HD600.  The most notable difference is that the Sennheiser engineers have tilted the tonal balance to give more emphasis to bass frequencies and less to the treble. Very low bass is still slightly rolled off but mid bass (the area that gives music an added thump) is now more obvious. Many who appreciate bass will find this a positive attribute.  To my ears the midrange is slightly less neutral, giving male voices, for example, a little extra body and warmth.  Overall the midrange is still superb.  Treble frequencies are smoother and more relaxed than the HD600, and although just as extended as the HD600, a little lower in level. This makes the HD650 relaxing to listen to and this can be useful if your favourite recording are a little harsh.Choosing between the HD600 and HD650 is down to personal taste. Technically the HD650 is the marginally better headphone, but the real difference is in the tonal balance.  If you like a headphone that is easy to listen to, with fairly strong bass, and a smooth but slightly soft treble, the HD650 is the one for you.  For those who prefer a more lively, neutral sound with more snap and attack, the HD600 may be the better choice.  Whichever you choose you can't really go wrong. They are both excellent headphones.

Despite its small size, this smart speaker delivers impressive sound quality that fills the room with crisp, clear audio. Setting it up is a breeze, thanks to the user-friendly Alexa app, and connecting it to other smart devices in my home was seamless. I've been blown away by its versatility - from playing my favorite music and podcasts to setting reminders, checking the weather, and controlling smart home devices with just my voice. The far-field voice recognition works like a charm, even from across the room, making it a convenient addition to any space.

To be totally transparent the review below is a copy and paste of the review I placed for the standard 5th Gen Echo Dot I purchased at a similar time.This echo dot is identical with the exception of the LED display. The tech between the two Dots are identical.I found the Display to be a welcome addition to the Echo Dot. Although I wouldn’t expect everyone to require this function in every room of the house , but I can see it being very useful in the kitchen/home office/ bedroom Enviroment.The display is easy to see and read and in the app you can adjust the brightness , switch it on/off which is a nice addition . I have it setup in my kitchen where I found it invaluable .. it’s one of those options you don’t think you need but would really miss it once you have one and use it regularly.I use the clock part all the time ( my wife has a tendency to change the oven clocks etc to 5 mins fast so she is never late ) and the clock in the echo uses an internet connection so it’s always accurate , and if you have a power cut or something similar it resets itself automatically saving you the rather annoying job of setting the time. It also automatically changes for summer time and winter time adjustments which is very nice and you can view as standard 12 hour or 24 hour clock.I also use the display a lot for timers which I use on a daily basis when cooking. It makes it very easy just to glance up and see how much time is remaining on the timer.The last thing is use it for is that I have the DOT on a wall mount which obscures the light ring somewhat, the display shows a Bell symbol just underneath the clock making you able to see if you have received a notification or similar.All in all in the right environment a really nice addition to the Echo Dot functions.Below is my review on the standard 5th Gen echo without the display, but other functions and hardware is the same.Having been investing in Alexa Dots for some years saw this newer version on a prime deal so added it to my collection . I normally replace an old version and find somewhere new to place the older one. My house is now pretty much covered with Alexa Dots now.As always with Alexa products this unit is easy to setup and install straight out of the box. As a veteran Alexa user I already have the app set up and used the Amazon preconfigured option selected at checkout ..If you are new to Alexa you will have to download and setup the Alexa app, which is also intuitive and easy to set up.Now to the Dot itself , it looks identical to the 4th generation dot so be a little careful when buying one and make sure you buy the generation you want . There should be better pricing and deals on the 4th Gen but the reason I purchased this one is due to some additional tech inside the unit and supposedly better sound quality.The sound is very good, not HI-FI quality but more than good enough for day to day use . ( I have paired 2 x Dots together in my main room to utilise the stereo options on the device. Apparently the 5th gen has a larger speaker/woofer and after comparing the 4th and the 5th gen together I can confirm the sound quailty is slightly better with particularly a better bass ) the difference in quality is NOT a huge jump from the gen 4 but still noticeably better , and is massively better than the 3rd gen Dot.An issue I have with both the 5th and 4th Gen Alexa Dot is the light bar is on the bottom of the unit. I use the light bar quite a lot to see if Alexa is responding in a noisy Enviroment or for notifications and as with most of my dots I buy 3rd party wall mounts for them to keep the cables nice and tidy and off a flat surface.the problem with this as most of these mounts place the light ring at the back and therefore close to the wall and makes the light bar hard to view. ( it’s a minor niggle not a deal breaker )The additional tech that grabbed my attention was the inclusion of a temperature and motion sensor.Both these would be ideal to add to my smart Home system to enable routines for heating and lighting etc so was eager to test these out.The temperature sensor:This is a great addition works very well and responds quickly to voice commands. I tested the accuracy by putting another smart temp sensor in the same room with an additional stand alone temperature sensor.The accuracy of the Alexa sensor was accurate and comparable to the two other sensors tested in the same room .. it is so easy to add it to routines in the Alexa app and works well.The Motion Sensor:I was eager to try this out as well as I wanted to make use of it Alexa routines such as if someone walked in the room the lights switched on and if there was no motion for a set time the lights would switch off. This is a fairly simple routine in the smart home .Unfortunately the motion sensor in the Alexa Dot 5th gen is pretty much useless and simply doesn’t work. It uses a slightly different way by detecting motion using ultrasonic technology. I realise this technology wouldn’t be the best as any noise in the room, such as TV , people speaking etc would diminish the accuracy of the sensor .. however having tested it many times in a completely silent room it simply doesn’t work , and on the odd occasion it does actually work it’s usually from an unknown source and not actually from someone entering the room.Conclusion: if you want good Alexa integration , a more than adequate sound for every day use , and a temp sensor buy this with no qualms that you will be getting a good quality product that works well straight from the box.If you are buying this for the motion sensor tech , don’t bother it’s useless and you would be much better off buying a separate smart motion sensor . The Echo Dot version is unreliable and just going to give you many headaches

I realise this technology wouldn’t be the best as any noise in the room, such as TV , people speaking etc would diminish the accuracy of the sensor .. however having tested it many times in a completely silent room it simply doesn’t work , and on the odd occasion it does actually work it’s usually from an unknown source and not actually from someone entering the room.Conclusion: if you want good Alexa integration , a more than adequate sound for every day use , and a temp sensor buy this with no qualms that you will be getting a good quality product that works well straight from the box.If you are buying this for the motion sensor tech , don’t bother it’s useless and you would be much better off buying a separate smart motion sensor . The Echo Dot version is unreliable and just going to give you many headaches

It's small,  neat and great looking.  There's a digital display which tells you what each song is playing when streaming through Amazon Music.  It also counts down your timers. It keeps a shopping list for me and reminds to do things I need to do.  I use it for work and home.  Great sound quality,  very intuitive.  It will even suggest recipes when I say what can I cook with ****. Alexa will even help the children with their homework! All round a fabulous little robot which I wouldn't be without.

Seriously didn't expect this Echo Dot to be so good. Sound is amazing from such a small speaker. Alexa is very responsive to my voice and it was incredibly easy to set up with the downloaded Alexa app. Glad I bought the one with the clock and digital display too. Also love the colour!

When I got my Alexa I was expecting something bigger, but I was wrong and had to prop it on my wallet to even see the clock, but I was not disappointed with the quality and easiness of use.Pros:1. Excellent sound for the form factor.2. Surprisingly quick to respond to commands.Cons:1. Small form factor may be unsuitable for some with a bedside table like mine and may need a stand.Overall, I highly recommend it, especially if it's on sale and you want to start your smart home journey, I bought a Tapo L350 to go with my Alexa so I don't have to bother with the light switch.

Only works at a certain angle
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2022Verified Purchase
Good idea in principle - not in practice.*The Angle I found myself changing the batteries constantly as I thought it was a battery issue but soon discovered it was an angle issue. The rockit works perfectly when at an upright, 90 degree angle to the floor. Most buggy handles are on a slant, maybe a 45 degree angle - the rockit is not a fan of this angle and prefers to be more upright. If I take it off the buggy and turn it on, while holding it upright, it stays on. However, shortly after attaching it back to the bracket on the buggy, it stops after a minute or two. It is incredibly frustrating as when I used it on a 3in1 chair, which had a newborn recline insert, and attached this to the upright leg, it served me perfectly. I've tried taking it off and placing it strategically on other part of the buggy frame, but the bracket is such a faff to get on and off its not worth the hassle.(The buggy I have is an Uppababy Vista)*The BracketYou've probably read it here already but I'll say it again. It is IMPOSSIBLE to remove the bracket once on. It's for a cable tie like mechanism and is supposed to have a tab to release it, but the tab doesn't lift high enough no matter how much pressure my husband or I apply. I cannot understand why this has been designed in such a faulty manner.*Battery lifeIn an era where most things are rechargeable this feels dated. Topped off by just how often the batteries need replacing (with the compartment only accessible with a screwdriver), this ends up being ver expensive in the long run.I have given 3 stars simply for the early use of it on the 3in1 chair. A real shame it doesn't work on my buggy.

If you stop she wakes up. The rocket has meant that nap time can be extended without me walk 6 miles.Although I do prefer the rechargeable version, I can’t comment on the battery for this one, as I returned it for the rechargeable one.Very good product, highly recommend.

As a whisky aficionado based in the UK, I recently had the pleasure of indulging in the Chivas Regal 12 Year Old Blended Scotch Whisky, and I must say, it truly impressed me. This delightful spirit became my go-to choice for relaxing evenings and special occasions. The smoothness of its flavor, combined with a balanced blend of fine ingredients, made each sip a truly enjoyable experience. I particularly appreciated the whisky's rich and inviting aroma that enticed me from the moment I opened the bottle. The Chivas Regal 12 Year Old's velvety texture and hints of honey and vanilla were a treat for my taste buds, leaving a long-lasting and satisfying finish. However, I must mention that the price point might be a bit higher compared to other options available in the market. Nonetheless, its impeccable quality and exceptional taste make it well worth the investment. Overall, I highly recommend the Chivas Regal 12 Year Old Blended Scotch Whisky to fellow whisky enthusiasts looking for a luxurious and refined drinking experience.

It is quite thick and doesn't go very far. I bought it to use on my split ends and also as a scalp tub after being recommended it by my hairdresser to help with thicker hair and hair growth. It is very thick and therefore isn't ideal for split ends as it dries as you would expect oil to dry and appears very greasy. I have used it just in my scalp an hour before showering and then washed it out and this has been most successful. My hair is light and incredibly shiny after leaving it in for an hour.The smell is strong, very minty but I like that.

As a seasoned whisky enthusiast always on the lookout for unique flavors, stumbling upon Sheep Dog Peanut Butter Whisky was a delightful surprise. Combining the rich warmth of whisky with the comforting familiarity of peanut butter, this unconventional blend offers a taste experience that is both innovative and thoroughly enjoyable.Upon the first pour, the aroma of roasted peanuts immediately fills the air, hinting at the indulgent treat to come. The golden hue of the whisky invites anticipation, promising a sensory adventure unlike any other. Taking the first sip, one is greeted with a velvety smoothness that coats the palate, followed by a burst of nutty sweetness that dances on the tongue.What sets Sheep Dog apart is its ability to balance the robust character of whisky with the creamy essence of peanut butter. The whisky's oak notes provide a sturdy foundation, while the subtle undertones of caramel and vanilla complement the peanut butter flavor, creating a harmonious blend that is both complex and comforting.Whether enjoyed neat, on the rocks, or as a playful addition to cocktails, Sheep Dog Peanut Butter Whisky never fails to impress. Its versatility lends itself to a myriad of drinking occasions, from cozy nights by the fireplace to lively gatherings with friends. And while its novelty may raise eyebrows initially, one sip is all it takes to win over even the most skeptical of palates.In conclusion, Sheep Dog Peanut Butter Whisky is a delightful departure from convention, offering a taste experience that is as bold as it is satisfying. Its unique fusion of flavors is a testament to the innovative spirit of the whisky industry, inviting drinkers to embrace the unexpected and savor the journey. For those seeking something truly different in the world of whisky, Sheep Dog is a must-try that promises to leave a lasting impression. Cheers to innovation, and to the joy of discovering new and delicious flavors in unexpected places.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2023Style Name: singleVerified Purchase
I read all the reviews and I was still on the fence about buying (not normally a fan of over sweet drinks), but there was deal, on so gave it a go. To my surprise, I really like it.There is a very faint peanut flavour, but someone else in their review said it tastes more like Werther's and that's spot on - more toffee with a slight peanut flavour (not a bad thing).It's marketed and labelled as a liqueur, and it is - it is very sweet. The sweetness is buttery and rich (rather than fruity or acidic) so it is dangerously easy to drink. That said, if you're after a more traditional whiskey liqueur this probably isn't for you. You don't get any real taste of whiskey, it is just the base for the other flavours.Guess the biggest recommendation i can give is that I wrote this after my first (rather large) glass, right after I ordered a few more bottles.

A gem of a find. Althought whiskey and peanut butter this is not.Very sweet but nice flavour. Loads of ice and a double measure will be a nice drink. Not unlike Bailey's or dooleys caramel liqueur but at 40% quite a bit stronger. It's got to be extra cold or it's too sweet. I've bought two bottles so I must like it a bit!I would be very surprised if this was not vodka or general spirit made to taste somewhat whiskey and sweetened with a peanut butter flavour.I noticed that during the black Friday sales it was more expensive than before. Don't get caught out by fake ""sales"".

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2019Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: DeluxeVerified Purchase
It’s great to have a 2D Mario scroller.  I grew up with the NES classics and when the New Super Mario games released onto the DS and then Wii I really enjoyed what they did with it.As I refused to purchase a Wii-U I never got to play this version which is why I am glad they ported it to the switch for this reason.  It’s worth pointing out that with the deluxe game you also get New Super Luigi U which is a much harder and challenging version of the Mario story line which mixes up the maps with more enemies and harder platforming along with the fact that Luigi handles like melted chocolate.  Also you unlock a challenge mode consisting of time attacks, coin collection, 1-up rally and some special levels which all provide the player with hard challenges to complete.The Mario game isn’t too difficult, there are sections that will test you however I managed to get my lives up to 99 pretty quickly and remain with that amount.  The later Superstar Road is where the levels really step up in difficulty especially when trying to claim all 3 Star Coins.  Speaking of star coins these can be a challenge to find in some levels especially the ghost mansions which have multiple exits. Not only this but there are secret levels to find which also can be difficult to locate and I wouldn’t have looked if it wasn’t for accidentally finding one and being shown the level in the menu system.Some issues I do have with the game come down to Nintendo tropes, I don’t understand why they kept the U in the title and added deluxe, I know it’s a Wii-U port but in honestly who wants to remember where it came from.  Nintendo have a habit of explaining things to you constantly, other games will tell you something and then leave you too it but in this game every mushroom you visit you will still have to wait for instructions on how to play and then wait at the end while it tells you, you will be getting an item.  This is not only subject to the mushrooms but when you die in a level you are booted out and have to re-enter which all takes time.  Why the couldn’t have a try again screen is beyond me!The game itself took around 10 hours to complete and then a further 5-6 finding all the exits and star coins.  I couldn’t stop playing it which is obviously a good sign, its what you come to expect from a Mario 2D platformer.  Having said that the levels can be pretty samey, it doesn’t mix things up like Odyssey or the 3D Mario games which are head and shoulders better than this but that nostalgia and speed runs make this a fun to play game.Before I finish up I found the multiplayer pretty fun to play although it becomes frustrating really quickly (depending on who you play with) the camera follows the lead player so it’s easy to drop off the screen if you lag behind. You can get that sense of working as a team with the right players but it’s very easy to just go forward and make it difficult for everyone else.  In multiplayer the bosses become really easy so if you do struggle on your own, great a trustworthy team.Personally though I prefer to play solo.

Excellent Game
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 November 2023Platform For Display: PS5Edition: SingleVerified Purchase
This is an awesome game, I bought it day one off off the strength of their previous Terminator game.Exploration and dialogue based sections have excellent writing true to the source material. The writing has made me laugh serveal times and grounds Robocop in the world convincingly. The visuals and art design evoke the original film to excellent effect.Exploration sections constarst very well with the shooting sections which are extremely fun and over the top, however they are paced well throughout the overall game and broken up with dialogue and exploration, the shooting would become repetitive if that was the only thing you do, lucky the free roam sections punctuate the more linear action focused sections to great affect.The dialogue choices let you choose how RoboCop reacts, is he more human, or more robot, this gives the game a telltale game feel with the dialogue, or dare I say, a light emergent sim vibe, like Deus Ex. A simple element to be incorporated into the game that elevates it beyond a competent shooter.This style of game is very deliberate, there is no open world or mission select, the game is unevenly paced in some respects, though it stadles the balance between procedural police work and bombastic shoot-outs, there is even a sense of mystery and existential tension thrown in for good measure. The only obivous modern convinience is the quest marker, which does a good job of directing you to the next story beat or fire-fight.The game is a measured and crafted experience, with a mix of free roam, gauntlet style levels and mini levels which may not be to everyone's taste. I would urge people to give it a chance though, as it is definitely greater than the sun of its parts.The progression in the game is well paced and it flows very well. Every side quest I have done has offered character development, humour and developmented the world building. Side activities are placed deliberately in your path and it makes accessing all the games content rather painless. This side quests also mesh rather seamlessly with the overall experience, I believe the game is richer when engaging with this content.The graphics look good, but there is some wonky animation and slight visual noise and reconstruction artifacts, this is especially noticeable on te edge of RoboCop character model. There is also slowdown in later fire fighters where there are many adversaries and sadly day scenes look noticeably worse than their nocturnal counterparts there is very poor shadow detail that look rather bad, though it does not impact the enjoyment of gameplay for me at all. Some graphical shortcomings can easily be forgiven in light or this games lower budget. The developers have maximised every good aspect of the game and crafted a unique experience that stands apart from other contemporary games.There is a quality and performance mode. I opted to play on performance mode as the visual tradeoff for increased fluidly is worth it, however, others can check out both of the modes and select their preference, it's nice to have the option.The developer is very respectful with what they adapt and I look forward to see which franchises they work on in the future. Escape From New York or Starship Troopers would be my ideal next games from them.If you are a fan of old school style games which offer great content and respect the customer please support this game.

Amazing AA Experience - Great Use of the License - Teyon Improves Again
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2023Platform For Display: PS5Edition: SingleVerified Purchase
For a Robocop fan this game is pretty much a dream come true. This game is a pure power fantasy and had me grinning from beginning to end.For a AA budget, Teyon have delivered a lengthy, satisfying shooter with light RPG elements. The script is often hilarious, can't remember the last time I laughed so much at a game. Some of the biting social commentary from the movies is here along with some genuinely funny side missions.The environments look absolutely superb and the artists really outdid themselves here. Seeing places like the Police Station , OCP Office and the Steel Mill recreated in game is a huge treat for fans. The lighting is almost photorealistic at times, it's a very pretty game.Robocop himself looks amazing. The character model is absolutely spot on.The humans less so. This is where the budget restrictions start to show. There are many re-used NPCs and the lip sync isn't the best. However you'll be having so much fun wasting goons as Robocop...it really doesn't matter!The developers have made many smart choices to how a FPS as Robocop would work. You are absolutely a bullet sponge but not indestructible. Standing in the open or in front of a mounted gun will see your health bar melt, so accurate shooting and use of the envionment is the order of the day to thin out vast enemy numbers.As well as Robocop's trademark Auto-9 pistol there are a huge variety of additional weapons found in the levels. These weapons are powerful but ammo limited, and in the early game very strong. You'll upgrade the Auto-9 during the course of the adventure so this ensures that all guns are useful from the beginning to the end.It's the interaction with enemies and the environment that really elevates the combat, Robo can deliver a punch that kills smaller foes instantly , he can grab them by the neck and toss them out of windows, into a group of their pals, wrap them round concrete posts etc it NEVER gets old.You can pick up all sorts of things from old school PC monitors, fire axes, chairs, skips, explosing canisters , motorbikes, all sorts and fling them at great speed toward enemies. This is also extremely fun! Punching a guy of a motorbike, grabbing his motorbike and flinging it at another biker in a huge explosion of body and motorbike parts is just hilarious fun.You can even use these powers as emergent gameplay. For example if you're pinned down by a turret gun, grab a nearby skip and use it as a shield, then when close enough, throw it at the turret gunner for an instant kill. Then rip the turret of it's mount and mow down everyone else with it.Early in the game I came across a minefield. You could walk through this extremely slowly and carefully , you could try and pot shot them at a distance, or you could grab a few wheelie bins, toss them through the minefield setting them all off and launching the bins into orbit. Great fun.What surprised me the most were the semi-open world parts set in downtown Detroit. These have many optional side missions, encounters and chances to serve the public trust or uphold the law. Some of your choices even effect how character react to you in the world. For example I caught a guy spray-painting. I could issue him a ticket or let him go with a warning. I chose to let him off with a warning and the next day there was a huge 'Robocop the Righteous' mural painted on the wall where I caught him. I've no doubt if I gave him a fine it would not have been so complimentary haha.There are many upgrades to obtain and you won't be able to unlock them all in a single run. Some of the cool ones include the obligatory slow-mo , the ability to recharge health from circuit breakers and ricocheting bullets , straight out of Robocop 2. There are also passive abilities and also ones that give you more dialog options.The game uses the original Basil Poledauris score to great effect. Robocop's targeting system is identical to the movies and of course, the distinctive clomp clomp clomp of the footsteps is there.I've finished this twice since buying it on launch, clocking in around 40 hours. It is a wonderful game that I will return to over and over. If you have any interest in Robocop at all you really should consider picking this up. It's a definite step up in quality from Teyon's underrated Terminator game and I'm really interested in what they do next. There is a real sense of passion and understanding in both their Robocop and Terminator games, these guys just get it.

Used the XS Max not long after it launched, and can say without hesitation at if you have a 11 or older this phone is a massive upgrade.Definitely get the higher storage. It’s just a plus, went for the 256gb & this phone has literally last me full days with 5-8 hours of daily usage with about 15-23% battery left. Not using power mode yet, and usually not n medium-to-low brightness as well & it still gets through using apps like snap,insta, drive, maps & others. Even playing games like Diablo immortal & Simpsons tapped out.Camera is an absolute must, although in-doors it seems to lack to older models. It really relies on more light even in basic settings.Sound, screen, pixels, everything is gorgeous. The size is noticeable if you come from any pro or max, but for the price, reliability, and quality it isn’t that bad.

Before we start, apologies for the long review, but I hope it's useful! This is a resubmission of my previous review, as for some reason it has disappeared from Amazon….So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However having my phone stolen, it had to be replaced.This years range is a mild revision over last year but that, in this case, is a good thing! So let’s break it down.Design:This years design borrows a lot from last years, and I think that’s a positive! Now, I know it’s subjective, but one of the things I like about the angular shaping of the 12 & 13 is that they feel less inclined to slip out of your hand. They feel well weighted, light but not excessively so and the anodised aluminium frame feels great in the hand. They also have the benefit of being more durable than previous models due to stronger glass, but it’s always suggested to use a screen protector.As a side note to the design, if you are looking at the 12 cases and wonder if they will fit, I’m afraid to say that they won’t. The camera hump is a slightly different size and has been moved on the back. Just something to be aware of before your new device comes.Performance:This is a area that I can’t say much about, but that’s not a negative. Apple devices, for better and worse, are always faster, smoother and more fluid than their android counterparts. I still have my first gen iPhone SE in the drawer, which I kept as a back up. It’s still snappy, quick and capable of keeping up with the pace of use, even today, so I expect this device to be no different. Scrolling and app opening/closing is buttery smooth, memory is more than adequate and overall it’s a good showing.Battery life:This is one of the areas where the 13 family really takes the lead above it’s previous iterations. Compared to my 12, I am getting at least 20% more screen on time per charge, which is very impressive. In addition, charging time appears to have dropped slightly over last years model, hitting 100% from zero about 10 percent faster than last year.Cameras:Once again, this is a small improvement, but considering the performance ability of the 12’s camera array, we are onto another winner. The main sensor now contains an improved optical image stabilisation system, which now stabilises the whole image sensor and not just the lens. This benefits the user greatly in night shots and if you’re a little shaky when holding the device. The wide angle lens is also a couple of degrees wider than last year. The image processor pulls out more image noise than the 12 too. A solid result.Warranty, support and repairs:One area that stands ahead of most is in the availability of support and repairs. All Apple stores have the ability to complete basic repairs in store, with more complicated ones done off site, can offer software support on site and can even arrange exchanges and replacements. If your phone develops a fault that’s covered under warranty, pop into store and they can sort it out. AppleCare takes this a step further. Say you crack your screen and you have AppleCare…..book a slot at your local store, pay a small excess of £29 (correct at time of writing) and they will replace your screen while you wait. If it can’t be repaired, a new device will be given to you. No other manufacturer offers this level of personal support without sending your phone off for repair, especially if you want it to be done by an official repair centre.Value and competition:I am not someone who buys one brand blindly, rather I choose to select each model by its own merits. Android or Apple, I’m open to all. However, at the 13’s price point, I think it’s far better than it’s main competition, which is the Samsung Galaxy S22. It has stronger battery life, better performance, a more premium build, less lenses but better image quality and overall just takes the crown for the middle to upper middle range for the year. I’m very impressed and hope to keep this one for a few years until something really opens my eyes or turns my head.So there’s a touch into the key areas of the iPhone 13. I hope this was useful to you. Take care and enjoy your summer!

I bought this on EMI payments as my old iPhone 5S recently packed up whilst I was involved in the purchase of a house. I needed to spread the cost but also have the full facility of a phone without having to negotiate credit cards, which I didn't want to get into, or pay massive upfront costs. For sixty quid a month (plus my tiny GiffGaff sim) I have a new phone, which will be all paid in a year. I also got 2T of iCould storage and an external generic hard drive for my old Mac around the same time for about 25 quid. This meant I could 'start again' with my Mac, and the endless photos from my travels could be stored safely while I save up for a new Macbook. Meanwhile, this phone has double the storage of my old Macbook. Unlike my old phone, it can perform admin tasks when I'm in quiet moments at work, such as applying for jobs. I'm not meaning to explain phones, it's just that for me new tech isn't renewed that often and I had to justify the expense to myself. This phone has already proved itself over the last month. The camera is much better than my old phone, but not quite as flashy as the most recent iPhone. I couldn't justify an extra 300 quid for a camera, regardless of my professional art needs, that wouldn't really meet my landscape photography needs. You still can't fit a mirror inside an iPhone in order to make it perform as well as an SLR. it's jus tnot physically possible yet to lose that terrible over-size foreground emphasis you get inmost smartphone pics. But for reference photos, portrait photography with friends, and general snaps this camera is good. I have an SLR I will use for landscapes instead, and may upgrade. The joy of a new phone is being able to listen to all the music you couldn't store on the old one, being able to perform complex functions a less powerful phone can't deal with, and also being able to indulge all your interests/needs in one place without worrying about space. I prioritised my phone upgrade before my Macbook upgrade for precisely this reason. If you have to choose between which one to upgrade, I'd go with the phone as you can always get cables to link your phone to a projector or tv screen if you're a student or trying to cut costs in the current economy. I'm amazed at how much I can watch on my unlimited data plan - the only risk is becoming a bit of an internet-addict too quickly. I love a new app called Metronaut too, so useful for musicians, and it's a relief to be able to indule my passions wihtout fear of freeze or collapse. Whenever I have had problems with this, it just requires a switch-off/switch-on - it's usually as I've had too much activity on my phone (for like, hours) or I just haven't closed pages. I""m impressed with the low-light picture-taking too - I can instantly update photos to Insta even in difficult light conditions. It means a better-documented moment-to-moment sense of of the World, and memories get stored, isntead of lost in storage collapse and frustration.

I had never used an iPhone before, and because my work is such that my phone gets rained on a lot, everyone suggested this phone to me. I was skeptical before I got it, but now I'm glad I bought it. Because it is resistant to rain. Its battery life is excellent, it has a better price than the other phones in its line. Great to work with. The screen resolution is excellent. Overall, I think it's great.

Sonos Play 1 - Wireless Does Not Mean Cordless
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 August 2017Verified Purchase
BLUETOOTH’S LOSS IS WIFI’S GAINAfter my relatively recent purchase of a Brennan B2, which for the uninitiated can be viewed as somewhere to store all of your CDs on hard-drive without the loss of quality normally associated with compressed files such as mp3, WMA or AAC, I made some attempts to equip it with remote speakers. It connected fine with my Yamaha A/V amplifier via an optical link but I wanted more.  I wanted a wireless link to a remote speaker or speakers.It came with a Bluetooth ‘dongle’ (why do I smile EVERY time I write that word?) so buying a Bluetooth remote speaker seemed the logical path to take. However, the Brennan B2 was still at this point under development and I had trouble pairing a Bluetooth speaker that I’d bought to go with it.To give Brennan their due, they worked hard to meet everyone’s needs, but my particular speaker was proving especially resistant to working for more than two minutes without crashing the Brennan box.In the end, I kind of gave up on the idea of having a wireless speaker in, let’s say the dining room. It didn’t help that being a three-storey house, the dining room was about the limit of where Bluetooth would reach anyway. Since it was designed as a short-range wireless medium, like from phone to car dashboard, or iPod to cordless earphones, it’s hardly surprising that you can just about wander one room away in my house where even the internal walls are solid.Thanks to my BT Hub 6, supposedly one of the most powerful proprietary routers going, the wi-fi around here is something else reaching the top floor with more or less a full signal.I then started looking for speakers that could use this means of transmission instead, and the name Sonos kept coming to the top of the pile.It also helped that thanks to the evolutionary nature of the Brennan B2, it’s software had been updated to allow it to work as a ‘NAS’ – (network attached storage device). This meant that as well as all the mp3 music files on my C:\drive, my PC file explorer could also ‘see’ all the FLAC (free lossless audio compression) files on my Brennan B2, which is where you want to be if you want to start playing really high quality stuff onto a set of, let’s face it, pricey speakers.At around £180 (now reduced to around £149) each, these didn’t come cheap, especially if you want to create ‘stereo’ since you’ll be needing two of the little blighters.I started off with just one to prove the concept, keeping all the packaging in case it needed to re-appear on eBay as “New (other)”.Well, I’m glad to report that its position in my house is assured, and within a day I was ordering the second one.GETTING IT GOINGSet-up went remarkably smoothly, after downloading the Sonos client software to my PC – you can also download Android and iPhone apps to control it, but I choose to take the desk-top path first, preferring to ‘add-in’ the Android app onto two phones later.Following the on-screen prompts, which ironically involved using the ethernet port at the back of the speaker (funny, I thought it was wi-fi!) with a connection to the router using the cable supplied, it was an easy job to create the wi-fi link enabling the speaker to work without its Ethernet ‘umbilical’. The process was quite slow as it spotted the fact that the speaker’s software needed an upgrade – what a surprise.Having got the speaker running, you then turn your attention to setting up the client.In my case, I wanted to add two music library sources, i.e. the respective paths to my networked Brennan and to my PC’s Music directory.Browsing for these was via the usual ‘Windows’ method of a dialogue box.Other sources are a bit more ‘pictorial’ with icons. For example, you can bring in internet services like Apple Music, Spotify or Deezer.I’m still of the old school who prefers his music on a CD that he actually owns - hell, it took long enough to persuade myself that music on a Brennan would sound as good as the actual CD collection! It’ll come as no surprise that none of these extra services were of any great interest to me, with one exception - TuneIn the internet radio site, an app I already use quite often especially while away from home. Thus, my speakers can now play from a list of pre-sets representing my favourite radio stations as well as all of my music files.What makes this all so much more logical is the adding in of smart-phone apps to do the same thing from anywhere within reach of your wi-fi.I was initially a bit worried that setting up via a PC first would somehow block my use of ‘apps’ too, but I needn’t have been concerned. Yes, the phone apps do offer you access to any music files actually on your phone (of which there are precisely none!) but more importantly they can also ‘see’ all the files linked to your desk-top PC’s network. Thus, they become what is effectively the remote control for your system once running. All you need is for your PC and speaker(s) to be running, which around here is for most of the day anyway. Another plus for those who play the music from their phones to these speakers is that, unlike a Bluetooth link, your music won’t be interrupted by incoming ringing tones, as the link is via the home wi-fi.From these ‘remote controls’ you can select the specific location of your speaker, should you be minted enough to have them throughout the house and the tonal balance and volume of the speakers – I found that the default ‘Loudness On’ was a little clumsy and boomy for me so turned it off.More importantly, you can use them to select what you want played. This can take the form of a play list simply by clicking on more than one album, or you can build-up a specific ‘Sonos playlist’ for later use.ERGONOMICS AND BUILD-QUALITY – I.E. DO THEY FEEL LIKE THEY’VE BEEN THROWN TOGETHER?Each Sonos play 1 comes heavily wrapped to survive the trials and tribulations of an Amazon or Hermes ‘please throw gently’ delivery regime. Once out of the box, which appears to have been thoughtfully made of all recyclable contents, you are immediately confronted with the prospect that these are weighty little devils. For something that’s only 160 mm high and 120 mm square, its weight at 1.88 kg gives it a convincing ‘heft’.Design is understated with a neat graphite metal grille all round (there is also a white version), a rubber-footed base with good grip and a lid with one solitary LED, a pause button and a volume up-down rocker.The mains cable has been specifically moulded to fit neatly at 90 degrees underneath using a standard figure-of-eight ‘ghetto blaster’ female plug. The lead is a fairly generous 2 metres in length. If I had one or maybe two criticisms, it’s the lead that does it for me.It’s not everyone who can afford to give up a mains socket for every speaker, especially, if like me you’re running two as a stereo pair. I’m lucky – my dining room was the previous owner’s office with 6 double mains sockets. Thus, I had no trouble dedicating two of them to my speakers, one at either end of the window sill. In fact, it may come as a surprise, after you’ve seen all the ‘sexy’ photos on the Sonos site of these speakers neatly slotting into book shelves and the like, that they even need mains leads at all. In my current situation, they’re not exactly hidden, trailing down the wall as they do, and since they’re fresh out of the box, they are as crinkly as hell which doesn’t help with getting these approved with ‘the management’ In the end, I bought the thinnest of that PVC mini-trunking, which conveniently was self-adhesive and painted it to tone in with the wall.So there we have it – wireless speakers that aren’t cordless! Just about all I can find to moan about.Having said that, the alternative would be to equip them with a rechargeable battery, which would lead to their inevitably being flat just when you fancied using them – I’m using the experience gained with my abortive attempts to get Bluetooth up and running here.I do think that the Sonos site could at least show a neatly routed power cable behind their speakers instead of pretending that it doesn’t exist.However, amongst hi-fi makers, they’re not alone!THE ACID TESTHow does it sound? Well, this was always going to be subjective, as with any loudspeaker worth its salt, but I do wholeheartedly agree with a quote for the Sonos website – “Sounds Bigger Than It Looks”. To pick one of these up when it’s in full flow will make you aware of the large amounts of air being pumped in and out by bass notes. For something which only has a combined woofer and mid-range speaker this is remarkable and partly down to the newer stronger magnets they’re using these days in speaker cones. The tweeter is a separate unit and all the better for it. High notes are crisp without grating on the ear. There are two amplifiers, called Class-D Digital, whatever that means. Sonos are coy about the wattage output, but in the real world, they can be cranked up to far more than needed so as Rolls-Royce used to say when asked about power - “adequate”.Incidentally, the amplifiers go into standby mode after a few minutes inaction. The Sonos website states that they use ‘negligible’ current when in this state, but that’s all relative to your own pocket and ‘green credentials’. At 3.8* watts each on standby, I work out that they would cost me around £16 for 66 units (aka kWatt/hours) of electricity per annum, just NOT to use them. I’ll be switching mine off – they only take about 30 seconds to reacquire the wi-fi when turned back on.(* Quite profligate compared to some TVs these days that now use less than 1 watt on standby)BUT ARE THEY HI-FI?Do I think they sound as good as my Yamaha amplifier playing a CD through my Cambridge Audio speakers?No, I don’t, but then they are smaller speakers playing PC files. OK, I’m playing lossless files which should equate to the sound of the original CD but anyone playing mp3 files or whatever Apple call their file compression has already ‘hobbled’ the sound quality to an admittedly tiny extent and has probably drummed themselves out of The Noble and Nit-Picking Order of Audiophiles anyway.However, side-by-side comparison is not what’s on the table here. They’re in a different room with different acoustics anyway. I-phone users can use the Sonos Trueplay app to ‘tune’ the system to suit the room’s individual acoustics. Android users will have to wait for a workaround caused by the myriad different microphones used in countless brands of Android phone.Personally, I think that my use of two of the smallest and least expensive (note I didn’t say ‘cheapest’) in the Sonos range makes the most sense if you want ‘proper stereo’ with separation between them. You can tell me till the cows come home how the Sonos Play 5 can radiate stereo from a single point and I’ll just glaze over especially when it costs £499!OTHER USESWell, at this early stage, I can’t say I’m going to pepper them all over the house as getting some music through to the dining room was my goal, but you can buy some interesting add-ons and upgrades. For instance, there are also larger speakers at (much) larger prices, the aforementioned Sonos Play 5 for example weighing in at an eye-watering £499.They also make sound bars for TVs which can then form the basis of a full 5.1 surround system including a pair of Play 1s at the back.One thing is for sure – their use on patios and for other outdoor pursuits will be limited by your having to run mains leads out there which rather takes the icing off the cake.In other respects, they are so versatile when run by your PC or phone app, that they can have different music in every room. The mind boggles given the younger generation’s penchant for drowning everyone else out.I’ve even dug out a redundant smart-phone, and by loading it with only the Sonos app, it is now the remote control in the dining room – but then, that’s just me!USEFUL ADD-ONSI spoke earlier about the merits of ‘to leave on stand-by or to turn off at the mains?’ I have now automated this process using two Orvibo Smart Mains Sockets, which allow me to turn off the speakers remotely via a phone app. Their stand-by electrical drain is quoted as ‘less than 0.3 watts’ which is just about as close to nothing as these things can get. This also means that the entire process of switching the speakers on and off plus choosing music to be played can be done from a smart phone.Also posted by me on the ciao.co.uk opinion site.

Sonos Play 1: the Ultimate in Quality and Convenience
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 November 2013Verified Purchase
I bought a pair of these little units unsure as to whether to use them singly in two rooms or to configure as a stereo pair in my office. I already had a Sonos 3 in there but I am not a fan of the look of the thing, even though it works really well, also being relatively large I did not have a convenient layout to create a stereo pair as it would have wasted limited shelf space. The Sonos Play 1s are wonderful! Beautiful, chunky design, very solidly built and wonderfully compact so sitting two on a shelf is really convenient. The attention to detail in the design is of the highest order. It even extends to such nice touches as the tailored mains input plug which so neatly fits into the underside and is gripped tidily by the case, looking as if it was built in from the start.Typically the controls are minimal - with the excellent Sonos software, you really do not need much in the way of controls on the units themselves but volume and play start stop are conveniently placed if needed. The sound is excellent from such small units - robust and clear and more than enough volume. Installation and configuration was, as with everything Sonos, perfectly straightforward, easy and trouble free. Although my Playbar (which I use as the portal to the internet for the network) is quite a long way away in another room through several thick walls, and although the Play 1s are very close to a lot of electrical interference (monitors, computers, local TV etc etc) they pick up the network with no problem whatever and perform reliably.The Sonos control apps are also the height of quality functional design. It is hard to think of any way they could be bettered. Not only do they perform faultlessly on an old iPad but also on Windows machines. Everything talks to everything else so even if you set up a play list on the iPad, when you open the Windows software, all the same settings are already there - fantastic attention to detail. I only play stuff from my NAS and was managing before Sonos with various stand alone receivers. Worked well enough but it was annoying that you could not move from room to room and have the same program playing at the same time. Sonos solves all of this - you can play the same thing in one, several or all rooms at will as well as playing totally different things in each room if you wish. How much better could it get? This company is right at the top of its game and I would have no hesitation in recommending them to anyone.  I expect to add further units to my setup in future.I would also like to add my very great satisfaction with Amazon's customer service who, though I made a mistake with the original order, had no hesitation in putting the matter right (at their own cost) to my total satisfaction. I used to purchase gear from another large online retailer who I shouldn't ""play"" around naming (!) but their customer service has declined greatly and in the event of problems it seems to be ""tough. You made your purchase. Sort it out for yourself"".  Amazon on the other hand have things right from the start and all the way through. Easy to contact and very supportive. I love buying from these guys!!!

Well made with a robust feel. Works reasonably well when you read how to use it properly. Have to calibrate before and during use to gain most accurate reading, but once you've done the process once, it's easy to familiarise with frequent use.The first time I used it for locating electric cables just 3cm away from my fixing point. I had my initial doubts and checked the position about 10 times, and it was very accurate.Glad I purchased it; pleased it also includes a battery (although I had already bought one)Great addition to my toolbox and it should keep me safe!

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 November 2020Verified Purchase
With the sheer amount of wire and pipework in houses this type of instrument is essential if you want to avoid hitting a water / gas pipe or electrical cable, even more so if you have a home where a previous owner has carried out DIY and run extra cables or pipes through spaces you wouldn’t normally expect to find them! Also very handy if you do want to hit a joist in a partition wall. My previous cable finder recently gave up the ghost after many years of service and there are certainly lots to choose from as replacements. Plumped for this one after a lot of searching, as it combines a good range of features with a competitive price. Have used it a couple of times so far for a mixture of tasks and it has performed well – which is a relief as a lot of these devices have some fairly damning reviews. Also tried it out on areas where I already know pipes/wires/batons exist to see how accurate its readings were – it gave accurate responses. It is important to use the settings on the device correctly and also particularly to make sure that you use the calibration each time you use it – and that is before each reading on a surface rather than just calibrating it when you start work! Re-reading a lot of the negative reviews it seems to me that many of the issues mentioned could arise from not calibrating the product before use. A neat and tidy product with a good range of features, an essential tool for any DIYer.

After a run in a couple of weeks ago when I was home alone and had banging on the front door at 11PM I was looking at different doorbell cameras. I decided on this one as it has such good reviews and cheaper than others and I am very impressed! I set it up an hour ago and can honestly say it was the easiest tech to set up I’ve ever experienced. Genuinely a 5 minute job and 3 of those are connecting everything.

Updated review - so far so good after separating out 2.4ghz signal
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2024Colour Name: WhiteStyle Name: Full System Video DoorbellConfiguration: Video DoorbellVerified Purchase
My system was extremely slow making the doorbell hit and miss until an Amazon Executive Representative suggested separating out the 2.4ghz signal if you have both running at the same time in your router. There is info on the web on how to do this so that your 2.4ghz signal has a name and your 5ghz WiFi signal has a (different) name. 5ghz is used for speed but 2.4ghz has better wall penetration. Blink uses 2.4ghz. I am now much happier about the system.Other problems:You can't bulk delete clips. This is actually very annoying as you have hundreds of them and clearing one at a time, being forced to view each one first, is excruciating. The alternative is to remove the card and do it on a computer with no guarantee you won't upset all the settings and have to register the sync module again.The view is a little unhelpful. It seems to be the wrong way round to me as as it would be more useful to see a persons face and the step (if they are leaving parcels) than a person's face and twenty yards either side of it.It says you can adjust the volume of the ring tone - the slider for this seems to have minimal effect for me. And why no individual setting on your phone for the notification volume? I may want a loud message tone for example but have the doorbel ringer much lower.

Overall reasonable value for money and does many things quite well. I don’t like not being able to use rechargeable batteries and suspect it may be expensive to run. Biggest disappointment was the inability to send a button press notification and chime to my echo show 5 which was the main reason for buying. After spending hours going round in circles with settings I found a load of reviews from people all complaining about the same thing and giving the device 1 star. Amazon are obviously aware but have done nothing to address the issue.They can start by changing the notification page where it’s not possible to save notifications settings…..Finally it would be nice to have some basic instructions that don’t have to be accessed online.Mine is going back.

Bought the Blink plus Module 2. Plugged in a USB stick, followed the instructions for pairing which took 3 goes, but works well with a good picture even at night. It’s not hard wired  so it remains to be seen what battery life is possible. The notifications both from motion detection and when the bell rings has been fine. I tried to have it open the doorbell view automatically on the bedroom Echo Show 8 if motion is detected. This works well but doing so doesn’t let you view on other devices so I reverted to the default setting.

Great as part of a Blink setup
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 October 2022Colour Name: BlackStyle Name: Stand-Alone Video DoorbellConfiguration: Video DoorbellVerified Purchase
The Blink wireless doorbell camera is a great addition to an established Blink home setup, whether that's just a camera and Sync Module or a full security system.The camera comes in a small nifty box that opens out to reveal a guide, the doorbell, rechargeable AA batteries, backing plate and screws.  I wish it has come with some 3M backing tape as an option too but they really want your to screw the backing plate to the wall for safety.The plate is really easy to install, you just mark the two holes where you want it to go, drill, and then stick the raw plugs in and screw in.  The doorbell goes on the top and clips in place.  You'll need the included tool to prise it off, so keep that safe for when you need to recharge the doorbell.The Doorbell can take the wires of your existing doorbell for the chime or just work with an Echo device or mini blink indoor camera.  The actual chime on the device is fairly loud to start with but it's easy enough to set one up on an Alexa with the advantage of seasonal sounds such as playing Christmas music or, my daughter's favourite, Halloween sounds, when someone rings.The Blink app is the same one that controls the other devices so everything is in one place.  It can show the current scene for a few minutes though you'll need to keep pressing to keep it on, or a list of the videos and photos it has taken when it senses motion or someone presses the bell.  The motion option can be set to be as sensitive as you want but it's fairly sensitive even on low and does still catch the odd person walking by on the pavement.  You can turn off the motion sensing altogether and just have the doorbell press if you want.I must stress that you really do need the Sync Module to get the most out of this.  You get a trial of the cloud service that saves videos to the cloud but if you don't want to carry on paying, the module along with a USB stick will save them locally and stream to any device with the app, which I think works out better.  It also allows you to control all your Blink devices together.The picture quality is pretty clear, it's a fisheye style lens but not as harsh as some other doorbells so you still get a good picture.  Night time isn't as clear but you can still make out features of people.If you have an Echo Show then it becomes even better as you can ask the Echo to show you the doorbell (or whatever you called it) and it will show the live video.  This has the advantage of allowing you to keep it on, unlike in the app, without it stopping.  It's also handy if you're in another room and want to see who is at the door.Overall, I'm really happy with the doorbell, as are the birds outside our house by the look of the camera feed (see the photo).

Great Camera
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2010Verified Purchase
This is my first DSLR. I've had a variety of Canon Powershots over the years and been very happy with all of them. This camera is exceedingly good. The picture quality far exceeds the compacts I've owned (I've still got my Canon A650 - a great compact, but not in the same league as this). The clarity, especially when zooming in, is very apparent. Compared to my compacts, even the most recent one, there is very little noise or grain in normal light outdoors. It's very good at landscapes. It's possibly even better indoors and with portraits - possibly too good, as it picks up all your facial imperfections and skin blemishes! The clarity is THAT good. It takes time to get the best out of it - although it's auto modes are very good, you can squeeze even better out of it if you use the programmable modes. Not tried the HD video yet, so can't comment.Although I can't compare this to other DSLRs (having previously never owned one), I would certainly recommend this camera to anyone. The build quality is very robust (yes, I've already dropped it, and the dog has knocked it off a chair) and despite all the features it offers, it's surprisingly easy to use. You even get a printed manual, which is unlike some other makes I could mention. If you want to move up from a compact to a DSLR, this is the camera to get (and no, I don't work for Canon).

            I have had my camera now for a number of years (purchased in 2010) very good quality, well built and easy to use whilst having a number of features that enable amateur photographers expand their portfolio and enable there creative energy flow.I have not felt the need to upgrade to another canon camera in the more expensive range until possibly now with the new canon 6D although the high expensive of the 6D is hard to personally justify when this model is so good..This camera is an excellent modal to start with and the vast number of lenses (I personally always buy canon) enable expansion into all area of photography (still life, landscapes, portraits). The lens included in the kit is of good quality and an excellent starter. I have not been let down by this camera either in the office (personnel portrait photos) or in the amazon rain forests and mountain ranges of Peru. I have personally purchased the following add on items; Speedlight 320EX flash, 70-300 EF L series lens and 50mm lens to compliment the main body.[[ASIN:B00005QF6T Canon EF 70-200mm f/4.0 L USM Lens]][[ASIN:B004MKNBUA Canon EOS Speedlite 320EX Flash Unit]][[ASIN:B00005K47X Canon EF 50 mm f/1.8 II Lens]]

My first Slr
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 August 2017Verified Purchase
I have always loved photography. There came a natural progression for me and this was my first step in to SLR. I choose Canon as I liked the quality of the pictures it produced. I felt Nikon was a close second but canon for me won hands down.The next step was choosing which SLR. After a lot of reading I went for this cheaper model so that I would learn the basics before taking the plunge for a more advanced model.I loved this camera right from the start. It's build quality is great, with so many features for the price. Mine came with a lens and I was running right from the start. I managed to get some lovely quality shots of friends and family.I had this camera for about 3 years before moving on. It never let me down. I wished I had kept it now as my daughter is also learning photography now.

very pleased for my first DSLR
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2010Verified Purchase
This was my first DSLR and upgraded from previous Canon and Sony compact cameras. The main driver for me was getting much better quality photos in low light conditions and the ability to have a much faster shutter speed to capture moments as they happen.So far I have mainly used the Auto setting  and no flash setting and changed the ISO settings. Both have provided massively improved low light pictures versus the previous compact camera's that cost me around £250 each. The Sports mode is also good for capturing in fast sequence actions shots.Once note on the Live View feature. Unless I have read it wrong in the manual, its not possible to use Live View i.e. view the picture on the LCD screen in any Auto modes. This was an initial disappointment as this is what my wife was keen to maintain from the previous compact camera.s It seems you can only use Live View in the program modes. For me its not a major issue and I dont mind using the view finder, but just be aware.Video mode is ok. Again note you have to focus to start with and this sets it for the duration so if people move out of focus then you capture out of focus images. Not a problem for me as I have a HD camcorder to take video which is why I bought it.I also got a 8GB SD Extreme card (class 6) which provides roughy over a 1000 photo's in full 14MB resolution so plenty of room in my mind.All in all I am so far very happy with my first move into DSLR world. They are more bulky to manage and clearly not as portable so if you are coming from a compact world you need to make this step change in your head before purchasing a DSLR.

I had my first SLR when I was about 15 yrs old, a Zenith, A really heavy Russian camera and everything had to be done manually, but it took the best photo's......until now ! I've been waiting for a decently priced high pixle digital SLR for years and have um'd and ah'd for a few weeks now over a few choices, but the reviews on here swayed me to the cannon 500d, and have I made the right choice ? Oh yeah !My Canon only arrived yesterday so all i've done so far is set it to auto but my gosh it's fantastic ! I am blown away with the quality of image, took some great photo's of my dogs, had to turn the focus beep off though because it was freaking them out ! Can't wait to get the time to sit down and have a really good mess around with it ! Definately a good buy, you get a lot of quality for an average price.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2023Colour: BlackSize Name: 4/64 GBVerified Purchase
I used to use HTC phones. I like android, I hate iPhones and Apple as a general rule. When my last phone was draining its battery every day or so, it was time for a change.First thing to note about this Samsung Galaxy A13, it has an extremely good battery life. I'm not constantly on social media (or at all in fact), don't constantly stream but I do watch videos, listen to music and text often, just to give you an idea of usage. I can get away with charging this phone once every 5 or 6 days.Features are great. I have a number of apps downloaded. It doesn't crash, the software is great, menus are easy to navigate. The screen is a nice size and the camera is very good. You can add extra memory, I added an extra microSD card to augment the phones already very good memory capacity. Cases and screen protectors are easy to find. A very solid smart phone.

I have previously always played with joy cons when gaming on the Switch, but the Pro Controller is a complete game changer in terms of comfort, grip and battery life. (So much so, I’m wondering why I never considered buying one before…….🤔).Is it still expensive? Yes (as everything “Nintendo” is). But is it worth it, in terms of the enjoyment and pleasure you experience whilst playing TOTK?

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 November 2023Verified Purchase
I'd been using joycons for a number of years. The provided grip when playing on the tv was uncomfortable. This controller remedies that. It feels great in the hand, and is actually a decent size. After usign the joycons the layout etc is all very familiar thankfully.Design wise, it draws motifs from Tears of the Kingdom, my favourite recent switch game. It makes for a great asymmetrical look that is sure to stand out.The instructions to set up were very clear, even allowign automatic sync if the controller is first charged through the USB port on the dock.

Not kidding on the lightness
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 May 2021Style Name: Generation 1Pattern Name: MouseColour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
I went from a very dated Logitech G9 to this. Night and day. Used now for a month.So immediately the lightness was the main difference. It was so light that I found I had to grip it more firmly. To counter this (because it felt unnatural to me) I bought Lizard Skins DSP mouse grip (warning: you have to cut it yourself) which solved that problem immediately.I was also using a 10+ year old glass mouse pad which had to go. I replaced that with a Artisan pad from Japan and some Corepad Skatz.The mouse itself:- It doesn't creak - not even with a squeeze to the sides. I don't know why that matters but it just feels solid despite being so light- Buttons on it are nice and tactile, clicky with no lateral movement- I have the white mouse with red lizard skin tape. It looks ok, it'd be better if they made the tape without me having to have cut it to give it the polished look- Do not use the grip tape that it comes with, it's rubbish- Lift off it really amazing. above a millimetre and the mouse curser will not move- side buttons are ok, a bit squishy, not as responsive as the front buttons- I'd really have liked to have the infinite scroll that comes with a lot of Logitech mice, i miss that from my G9- No RGB - i do not care for it anyway- Battery life is brilliant. I've charged it twice in the month I've had it, I use it all day for work and then in the evening for games- Ergonomically going from a G9 to the superlight was a bit strange, i think i was more claw with the G9 and I'm now a bit in-between because the length of the mouse and the hump in the middleIt was an odd conversion because I used to think that heavy was nice (i had the extra weights in my G9) and I wasn't sure I was sold on all the fuss about having a lighter mouse, but now I've changed to a light mouse the way I'd describe it: it feels like an extension of my hand now, rather than a device I'm moving about with my hand. I barely feel it's there but I still have the control.If you can get past the price for what looks like a very simple mouse: the pad, grip tape and skates combo puts the Logitech G PRO X SUPERLIGHT into another league.

Confusingly good.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2022Style Name: Generation 1Pattern Name: MouseColour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
Absolutely outrageously good. I look at this mouse out the corner of my eye with furrowed brow wondering how it can be as good as it is, it's too good, it's so good that I don't trust it, like it's going to steal my wife when I'm at work. Yes, it's lightweight, but not too light, It's super light when you take it out of the box for the first time and compare it to your old mouse but you get used to the lightness of it, it becomes normal...... it actually feels kinda heavy in a weird sort of way after a while which I guess is down to my second point which is the build quality which is excellent. It's made from a premium plastic, it feels thin but not cheap it's very nice actually, it feels like when you go shopping and see a nice product from a nice shop that you want to buy but kinda wonder if it's worth the money but when you buy it and get it home you are glad you did so it's good buying experience too. It's a nice shape, doesn't slip out of your hand while gaming under pressure which is a key point for me to say because I was worried about buying this as it's the first ambidextrous gaming mouse I've owned. The sensor is excellent, I've come from a Steelseries 650, I play CS:GO and I can tell the difference, It is better but it took me about a month to get used to it. All buttons are good, side buttons are a little squishy and fronts can sort of squish under extreme pressure but once you notice you've squished them you learn it doesn't like it and I haven't done that again. Mouse wheel is good, tactile and the little light is cute too. The battery life is abnormally good, it takes me like half an hour to charge and lasts over two weeks it is bizarre. I feel like its got a solar panel attached to it or there's a car battery inside it or something, is this alien technology? Did Will Smith steal this mouse from the alien mothership in Independence Day?, is this mouse part of The Predators kit that he uses to hunt the Xenomorphs with? Probably. There's more to like, the software is solid (it used to be crap a couple of years ago but its good now) the PTFE feet are excellent, some design touches are nice it's just really really good. Having said that it's not perfect IMO. People complain that the charging connector isn't USBC but honestly you hardly ever use the thing it doesn't make a difference. There's no 4th programmable button which is a massive PITA TBH, I feel all gaming mouse should have at least 3 on the side + the mouse wheel button. I had a problem with the mouse wheel on my first one of these and had to RMA it for another one. It's ever so slightly boring, a tiny tiny bit plain, there's no lights, the tiny light that's a DPI indicator doesn't stay on all the time and ugh I know its to save weight blah but it should have a little swazz about it, a light up logo or mouse wheel light or something just to give it that little bit of juice but I like that type of thing where others might like that its not fancy. Anyway, you should buy it, go ahead, it's worth the money.

These are a later version of the older model we already have, so took a little bit of getting used to at first, but once settled in, easy to use. Great value for money - less expensive than from elsewhere on the net. Has a button cell as well as solar power, so great addition to ensure battery never lets you down with this instrument.

Probably the best calculator for School or College use, but very flimsy.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2023Style Name: Successor ModelVerified Purchase
This is probably the best calculator for School or College use and because it is not programmable you can take it in to most technical exams as well.The processing power and the range of functions within this device are quite astounding.  You can key in mathematical problems just as you see them in you text books and it works them out.In fact the only disappointment I have with this calculator is that it is very lightweight and flimsy and the protective cover is almost useless.  What with being bundled into backpacks with heavy textbooks and other item I don't think this device will last very long without being bent or crushed.  This calculator was purchased to replace a 10 year old Casio one that is still working fine, I just wanted to update to the latest functions.  The old calculator is very solidly made and its protective case fully encases the calculator and is so robust you can actually stand on it without it collapsing or crushing.A highly recommended calculator for its processing abilities, but disappointing for its fragility.

The ultimate scientific calculator – outstanding
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 August 2020Style Name: Model 2022Verified Purchase
Outside of a graphing calculator, which is a much more expensive and complex proposition, this has to be the best you can get. Casio has spent years refining the way these things work, and it shows. The keyboard, for instance, is faultless. The display, considering it's not backlit, is very clear, and higher resolution than in previous models so you can have more rows in a table or spreadsheet. It's a very fast calculator too, with most operations happening instantly. Mostly it works on solar power, and there's a little 'sun' icon to tell you this is happening. If the light's too dim, the LR44 backup battery will take over, and since this is just about the most widely available button cell battery, you should be able to replace it easily and for peanuts.The range of functions on offer is amazing – almost too much until you get your head around them. Might be worth watching some YouTube videos for this. There are quite a few on this calculator and others that work like it does. One cool feature is the 'QR code' creator that puts a QR code on the screen you can scan with your phone to get graphical representations of functions through the Casio app that you would be able to put into projects. Nice.If you're tempted to get a cheaper brand to save a couple of quid, don't bother. This is such a low price you may as well have the best. You won't get the great keyboard with a cheaper brand, or the speed, or the cool carbon-fibre effect body. Casios are always well built and last forever. This one weighs nothing but feels good and well built although the hard case it fits into is a little bit rattly and being white will show dirt.My only other criticisms are that some of the text on the keyboard is a bit too small to read comfortably, especially on the textured surface, and the same thing applies to some of the text on the screen too, like the list of scientific constants. And this comes in a blister pack that you have to destroy to open instead of a simple box you can keep. Small beer.Really, this is about as good as it gets. It's outstanding. Just get one.

Incredible media and gaming capabilities! A great purchase!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 March 2015Verified Purchase
A fantastic value console that really compliments our home entertainment area!There is a lot of bickering in the console market, some like green, some like blue. However, if you are looking for a fantastic, easy, accessible gaming solution for you and the family you really can't go wrong with either of the main consoles!We bought the XBO and the PS4 to compliment the PS3, 360 and PC etc and can say without hesitation that BOTH of these systems have some fantastic exclusives and multiplatform games.The XBO is a wonderful feat of engineering with some great media capabilities that keep the entire family entertained for hours On end. Initally I was going to cover the pros and cons of both consoles in my review, the differences between them etc... But after re reading my review, I decided to scrap that and say this...In the last few months, I have played both the XBO and the PS4 and expereinced emotions, toward gaming, that I have not had since the days of my NES, SNES, Mastersystem, MegaDrive!I feel that the last few generations or so has really pushed the gaming market in a strange direction, it became saturated with yearly releases of the same games, some getting worse after every release, it also went on far too long! By the end of the generation I thought I was done with gaming for good, I thought it was over for me...Until I played games on BOTH of these consoles!I was transformed back to a time where the creativity behind the game was the driving force, not the cash reward! This is going to be an exciting generation, regardless of system, we now have the ability to truly expereice what the developers Imaginations Intended.So let's put aside the specs for now, let's forget the colour of the box, let's sit down, and marvel at the incredible gaming experiences currently available to us on BOTH of these consoles and make some Incredible gaming memories together!

My New Xbox One
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 June 2014Verified Purchase
I brought this console due to me wanting an upgrade from the 360 and so far I'm loving the experience from the new next gen console. However every console have there pros and cons...Pros-Graphics have improved, games feel more realistic.The console is quiet and does not heat up at all like pervious consolesNice variety of exclusive xbox one game titles such as Dead Rising 3, Forza and so on. Very good titles and enjoyable to play.Good features within the dashboard like snap TV, Blu ray basically can multi-task in and out of game in the dashboard.You can use any type of external hard drive as long as its more the 256gb and has 3.0 USB to plug into a USB port in your console to increase the storage.Cons-A new feature with the xbox one is to install your games to you hard drive so incase the disc gets scratched  it will still run, but this is bad because if your new to the console the game installing at first can take really long to install fully to 100%  sometimes even a day or 2 and even though the game says ready to start you need the game to fully install to play multiplayer however when having the console you do get use to it just get 1 game at a time.Not enough hard drive storage, you start off with 500gb but when starting up the console to set it up you need to install a 100gb update which takes away some and due to games being 40 odd gb its not enough.Overall, i am please with the new xbox console it was worth getting rid of my 360 as Microsoft have improved the experience massively and have made it more entertaining and enjoyable, i recommended to get it if you plan on getting an upgrade from last gen!!!

Good console, needs more games.. a lot more
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 June 2015Verified Purchase
I bought this purely for Titanfall and because the console was going cheap on the marketplace.  The console is OK but I still prefer my PS4.  The UI has gone backwards for me.  On the Xbox 360 is was superior to the PS3 but the roles have reserved (as it seems their fortunes).  When playing TF with a friend we found there was a good few seconds lag in mic sound so were finding it very hard to communicate when playing such a fast game (we were both using the standard Xbox headsets).The big issue is the lack of exclusive games on it.  From E3 2015 there are some good-looking games on the way but the PS4 still, in my opinion, has the better catalogue and is generally getting the more/better exclusives (timed exclusives, DLCs, as well as games).  Recore, Quantum Break and Rise of the Tomb Raider (the latter being only a timed exclusive to later come out on the PS4) are the only upcoming exclusive games of interest.And it's struggle to get up to 60fps at 1080 is a little disappointing at the moment (I'm sure that will change in the future).

invaluable if you regularly use different audio, visual & office software on Mac & PC
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2023Style Name: Stream DeckSize Name: 15 Keys (MK.2)Verified Purchase
Spoiler alert. This device is awesome and invaluable if you regularly use different Mac and PC software programmes, especially for editing audio & video.You can stop there or read on for a bit of a story and the actual review - your choice.The storyThis device sat on a shelf for well over 12 months. It was a compulsive purchase based on a video I watched  on YouTube and possibly at the end of a night out with friends, erm…I had almost forgotten about this purchase, not because it wasn’t of use, I just didn’t think I needed it at the time; my mistake!Let me explain…As mentioned, this was an impulse purchase because it looked cool and I told myself I’d use it…eventually.It must have struck a chord of sorts because I was sure to buy the upgraded MKII version with a detachable/replaceable USB cable.I didn’t use it.Jump forward 12 months and video editing is now a main focus and keyboard short cuts are all the rage. As my editing skills develop and my editing frequency increases and as ridiculous as this sounds (it did to me when I heard other editors say it) multiple key short cuts were becoming a pain in the backside and in particular the blade cut and delete (yes, Final Cut Pro X on the Mac) Enter the Elgato Stream Deck.The ReviewThe Elgato Stream Deck is a fully customisable macro keypad that allows you to set single key inputs for what would normally be multi-keyboard/finger short-cuts e.g. ctrl+cmd+arrow up to lift a clip from the timeline in Final Cut Pro, is now a one button press and with a nice vibrant pic displayed on the very smooth LCD buttons to boot. More on that in a bit.This little device works across a variety of apps for both Mac & PC and not just editing software. It also comes with Elgato (via download) free software for optimising and customising the macro keys and shortcuts.This is a super tidy unit (specs below) and well built. It won’t take being bounced off the floor, but oddly enough, that’s not its intended purpose. The main icon panel can sit directly on your desk or in the angled case. The USB cable is attached under the unit, but flat and right angled so that the unit can sit flush with your desk regardless of preferred set-up.The 15 macro key version I have sits just about right for my needs at the moment, but you may wish to look at the 6 or the much bigger 32 key versions, depending on your own needs. I will say that after finding out just how useful this piece of equipment can be, I am looking at the 32 key version for in the not too distant future.As an example of the speed of work flow, I’ll use another FCP application - I have the mouse on the right and the Stream Deck on the left. I select the point I wish to cut. Press the centre macro key and then press the macro key underneath its it is set to delete. This finger/thumb quick action is so convenient and time saving.The LCD keys are also customisable via the previously mentioned Elgato software. This option also allows you to assign set functions to keys and also assign an icon. A pleasant surprise was that there are loads of free icons available in the Elgato icon library. One of my main hotkey shortcuts is for YouTube (yes, you can assign URLs to the macro keys too) and there was a YouTube icon in the library along with multiple community created ones, which for the most part are great! There are even animated icons if you want them, but I personally prefer the static icons, but it’s your choice.The next pleasant surprise was that you can set different profiles or ‘pages’ of icons for the different software you are using. If you are jumping from Premier Pro to Microsoft Office or Final Cut Pro to Light Room, then you can set up you own pages, hotkeys & icons as you wish which equals fantastic versatility!All good so far, so now a couple of minor gripes…Every once in a while the unit won’t boot up properly, but this is pretty rare.The angle of the stand is great visually, but for my (left) hand it’s too steep at roughly a 60 degree angle, when half that would have been much more comfortable whilst still allowing you to see the icons. You can take the unit off the stand and as you get more used to and with more frequency, you won’t even look at the buttons. This is the best way to go in my opinion, but again it’s nice to have the option of stand or no stand.One last note and this is nothing to do with the unit; I would suggest you learn some main/most used keyboard shortcuts before you use the Stream Deck. Reason - if the deck stops working in the middle of an edit and you don’t know/remember the actual keyboard ones, then you’re stuck. Again, this is unlikely, but worth considering.On the whole an awesome and effective idea, executed fantastically by Elgato.Side note:Elgato have also released the + version which features 8 macro keys, a touch stripe and dials, which can be incorporate into a streaming set up. I cannot comment on that device at the moment, but perhaps in the future…Specs:Size: 11.8 x 8.4 x 2.5cm without standWeight: 145gConnection: USB 2.0 (cable is roughly 1.5 metres)Stand angle: Approx. 60degreesMaterials: Plastic

            Spoiler alert. This device is awesome and invaluable if you regularly use different Mac and PC software programmes, especially for editing audio & video.You can stop there or read on for a bit of a story and the actual review - your choice.The storyThis device sat on a shelf for well over 12 months. It was a compulsive purchase based on a video I watched  on YouTube and possibly at the end of a night out with friends, erm…I had almost forgotten about this purchase, not because it wasn’t of use, I just didn’t think I needed it at the time; my mistake!Let me explain…As mentioned, this was an impulse purchase because it looked cool and I told myself I’d use it…eventually.It must have struck a chord of sorts because I was sure to buy the upgraded MKII version with a detachable/replaceable USB cable.I didn’t use it.Jump forward 12 months and video editing is now a main focus and keyboard short cuts are all the rage. As my editing skills develop and my editing frequency increases and as ridiculous as this sounds (it did to me when I heard other editors say it) multiple key short cuts were becoming a pain in the backside and in particular the blade cut and delete (yes, Final Cut Pro X on the Mac) Enter the Elgato Stream Deck.The ReviewThe Elgato Stream Deck is a fully customisable macro keypad that allows you to set single key inputs for what would normally be multi-keyboard/finger short-cuts e.g. ctrl+cmd+arrow up to lift a clip from the timeline in Final Cut Pro, is now a one button press and with a nice vibrant pic displayed on the very smooth LCD buttons to boot. More on that in a bit.This little device works across a variety of apps for both Mac & PC and not just editing software. It also comes with Elgato (via download) free software for optimising and customising the macro keys and shortcuts.This is a super tidy unit (specs below) and well built. It won’t take being bounced off the floor, but oddly enough, that’s not its intended purpose. The main icon panel can sit directly on your desk or in the angled case. The USB cable is attached under the unit, but flat and right angled so that the unit can sit flush with your desk regardless of preferred set-up.The 15 macro key version I have sits just about right for my needs at the moment, but you may wish to look at the 6 or the much bigger 32 key versions, depending on your own needs. I will say that after finding out just how useful this piece of equipment can be, I am looking at the 32 key version for in the not too distant future.As an example of the speed of work flow, I’ll use another FCP application - I have the mouse on the right and the Stream Deck on the left. I select the point I wish to cut. Press the centre macro key and then press the macro key underneath its it is set to delete. This finger/thumb quick action is so convenient and time saving.The LCD keys are also customisable via the previously mentioned Elgato software. This option also allows you to assign set functions to keys and also assign an icon. A pleasant surprise was that there are loads of free icons available in the Elgato icon library. One of my main hotkey shortcuts is for YouTube (yes, you can assign URLs to the macro keys too) and there was a YouTube icon in the library along with multiple community created ones, which for the most part are great! There are even animated icons if you want them, but I personally prefer the static icons, but it’s your choice.The next pleasant surprise was that you can set different profiles or ‘pages’ of icons for the different software you are using. If you are jumping from Premier Pro to Microsoft Office or Final Cut Pro to Light Room, then you can set up you own pages, hotkeys & icons as you wish which equals fantastic versatility!All good so far, so now a couple of minor gripes…Every once in a while the unit won’t boot up properly, but this is pretty rare.The angle of the stand is great visually, but for my (left) hand it’s too steep at roughly a 60 degree angle, when half that would have been much more comfortable whilst still allowing you to see the icons. You can take the unit off the stand and as you get more used to and with more frequency, you won’t even look at the buttons. This is the best way to go in my opinion, but again it’s nice to have the option of stand or no stand.One last note and this is nothing to do with the unit; I would suggest you learn some main/most used keyboard shortcuts before you use the Stream Deck. Reason - if the deck stops working in the middle of an edit and you don’t know/remember the actual keyboard ones, then you’re stuck. Again, this is unlikely, but worth considering.On the whole an awesome and effective idea, executed fantastically by Elgato.Side note:Elgato have also released the + version which features 8 macro keys, a touch stripe and dials, which can be incorporate into a streaming set up. I cannot comment on that device at the moment, but perhaps in the future…Specs:Size: 11.8 x 8.4 x 2.5cm without standWeight: 145gConnection: USB 2.0 (cable is roughly 1.5 metres)Stand angle: Approx. 60degreesMaterials: Plastic

A Brilliant Piece of Kit.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 September 2020Style Name: Stream DeckSize Name: 32 KeysVerified Purchase
Where has this been all my life? The difference this makes to my workflow is phenomenal..Its easy to set up, the interface is stable and intuitive and you can program it to do nearly anything you want on your PC.I`ve been using it with:-- Normal Windows tasks and shortcuts.- My D.A.W.`s (Digital Audio Workstations), e.g. Ableton Live, Acid Pro 8, Music Maker.- Flight Simulation software, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, FSX, Aerofly and others.- Many Steam Games.- Calibre, (editing Book metadata etc).- Accessing favorite websites.And these are just the things I`ve thought of so far.. Basically if you can do it with a keyboard, then this unit can do it with a single button press, its a macro button unit on steroids.. You can store shortcuts, websites, key combinations or sequences under each button, You can use folders to extend the number of macro`s/buttons available in a profile, you can store different profiles, and you can even play games on it.  The device is aimed at streamers but can be used with virtually any windows software to create single button shortcuts.The device is well constructed and connects via USB 3, it has a USB 3 Type 3 female jack on the actual unit and is supplied with a good quality (replaceable) lead to connect it to a USB 3 Type A connector. (I`m told it will also work on USB 2).The display is bright and adjustable and can be configured in detail. In addition to button programming or configuration, you can choose what icon each button shows,  the font can also be changed.This is a Highly recommended piece of kit for anyone who wants to increase their workflow, whether they are a streamer or just a normal PC user.

An average performance
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 November 2023Colour Name: CharcoalConfiguration: Device onlyVerified Purchase
It was very easy to set up. What I like:1.  display is good being an 8 inch screen2. The sound quality blew me away the bass  and clarity is amazing.3. Videos calls are clear sounding and the 13MP camera’s clarity is awesome. Despite it not having zoom.4. I like the robust feel and look and the tilting feature.5. The Silk web browser is a must have if you want to view Netflix etc and the sound and resolution quality is amazing when watching videos and listening to podcasts.What I don’t like.1. My connected ring doorbell camera view isn’t very clear and looks as though you’re looking through a fish bowl lens. The resolution could be clearer.2. The idea of creating skills to enable Alexa isn’t very successful. Most of the skills are unresponsive after tediously scrolling the list to find a match and then repeatedly trying the setup only for it to fail,3. I don’t know if it’s my WiFi but I’ve noticed my connection dropping one too many times.4. I don’t like that I can’t connect directly to Netflix, YouTube etc and have to go through echo’s silk website..,tiresome.5. I don’t like that it’s a static plugin connection and I’ve had to buy a battery powered device to make it wireless/mobile. For the price I think this feature should have been included.Overall, I think it’s an excellent addition to add to my personal home although improvements could be made.

The picture and sound quality are also very good.Not like my last one, the most expensive of the show models it  was useless. Alexia so unresponsive  and the wireless connection didn’t work, couldn’t watch anything without it getting cut off, or not able to connect at all. It was a total  waste of money. My other appliances had no trouble picking up the Wi-Fi signal, so it definitely had something wrong with it. Hope this one lasts a long time to make up for the faulty last one.

The sound on this is really good, a nice base to it and crisp and clear for the size of speaker, ideal for my living room. Easy to set up and mess around with to your own settings. Like how it can be used as a photo frame slide show although would like it if i could get rid of the Amazon type i for that comes up on it- have tried but cant seem to get rid of that part. I have it set to show photos etc at certain times but often i have found the the unit will still show out of these times. Easy to move around to another room if you need to. Large clock thats present on the front so you can always see the time.  Looks good but i wish it wasn’t such a funny angle as when you look into the room from the camera ( to see my dogs ) it points towards the ceiling, so i have had to prop the back of the until up a little. I did try a stand but this w as no different as when you angled it down more it would just topple over. Maybe it would be better to put the camera lens at the bottom of the screen instead of the top. Got it for a good price too which was even better. All in all a good unit for my purpose.

Really good value and sound quality is better than expected (at the moment). Haven't tried all the functions but it's pretty impressive. Very easy to use and does everything it should.I just wish one could add more than five short cuts on the home screen and that Alexa would repeat suggested music lists until I'd finished with one  instead of giving a fresh list every time based on what one was just 'listening' to. Often I'm just experimenting with music I'm unfamiliar with!  These are small dissatisfactions, though, considering I thought I was going to have to pay at least twice as much for an stereo Echo with a screen. I did go to the expense of buying a tilting stand for the Echo Show to sit on, something I think should be supplied with it.

This Call of Duty is one of the good ones. The campaign was shorter than others, but this made it quicker and easier to finish, and the plot developed well. I'm assuming there will be a follow up game involving Makarov based on the ending. Being able to play old multiplayer maps, especially Rust, was an added bonus. Liked how levelling up on MWZ made you level up on multiplayer as well

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 November 2023Verified Purchase
Couldn't be more disappointed.The multiplayer is just a collection of maps from previous games, the war zone, zombies and campaign all use the same map all made from old assets put together like a wonky jigsaw, the campaign is lazy past the 1st mission consisting of 'open combat' missions without any real story or structure and it just feels very wrong...I'm a big fan of the stories in the games and characters and it just feels wrong.Multiplayer the pros would be sound design and fun, but again it's very lazy and it doesn't feel new in any way.Warzone again is not a new feature so doesn't count and zombies while really fun is lazy and the equivalent of an open world rpg with poor quests and filler content.The worst CoD I've ever played even worse than CoD Ghosts.

Classic Frustration Game
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2017Verified Purchase
I had this game when I was a kid and was very excited when my child unwrapped this for Christmas. The instructions are basic enough for even young children to understand and the game lasts forever. The gold Genie is a wonderful addition to the game and gives players a advantage/ disadvantage depending on who has it. Its perfect for younger children as the dice don't get thrown across the floor. On the original game I had it had a popomatic dice dome which you pushed down on and the dice popped but now its a little handle at the side which if you get a little heavy handed, can knock down the little pegs. This isn't an issue because after a few times you get a feel for how heavy handed you can with the handle. I would definitely recommend for anyone.Pros: Fun game that can last agesSimple instructionsDice dome so you won't lose dice ( which I can guarantee will happen with every board game I have lol)Good quality plasticCon: Can last a real long time so younger children may get boardIf you're too heavy handed on the whacking feature, you may knock your characters down

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 March 2016Verified Purchase
My 5 year old sone loves this game so bought this as a gift for his friend for his 5th birthday.Unlike many other games for this age group, they can actually play independently together (the rules are fairly easy to understand) but it also has a little interaction as you have to move pieces and also roll the dice by hitting a lever.The game itself is for 4 players, but you can play with 2.  The best thing is it isn't a boring game for parents either. I have been sat at the table playing a whole host of boring kids games which have no real aim but this is fun for adults and ids alike of any age - challenges children but is interesting too for an adult.  My son loves getting the ""gold genie"" when he rolls the dice!  a 3 year old may be a little young but they can still join in by rolling the dice and moving pieces.Would recommend for a present too.  would recommend this for any age from 4 upwards.

Frustrating changes from the original
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2012Verified Purchase
A classic game that I played as a child, but with a few changes that seem to make the game worse. The game, if you haven't played it, is pretty simple and involves moving pieces round a big circle. If you land on another players piece it goes back to the start. The die is locked inside a transparent dome which stops int getting lost. The changes to the original are that the clicker-style dice shaker has been replace by a ""slamomatic"" which basically involves your child thumping a plastic paddle (whick jolts the dome) to roll the dice (of which there are two now). The trouble is that if hit to hard the playing pieces jump out of their sockets - the fit is very poor - and that can ruin the game. With two small boys, hitting-things-to-hard is pretty much a given. There is also now an additional piece, the ""genie"" which can prevent your pieces being sent back to the start, but it is a complication and distraction to the game that is not really needed, although maybe there are gameplay reasons for having it. It's also easy to forget, in all the excitement, to check the genie die each turn. However, you can ignore it if you want. In general, this feels shoddier than the original, mainly due to the plastic paddles and the sloppy fit of the pieces, although I can't say that it would actually break. Still, the kids like it and it's good for counting skills.

I gave this a 5 star review, partly because it delivered exactly the feeling I expected and partly because I couldn't bring myself to rate it low given that I was trying it for nostalgia's sake. That said it's important to give an honest review so I will!It is quite hard to believe that I used to eat this and enjoy it. I made this following all instructions and it came out ok, only a few of the ""beef"" pieces were like dry biscuit, but the sauce came out thick and gloomy and with an initially OK flavour followed by a weird aftertaste (I don't remember that!).I have a feeling they have modified the recipe, it's not got the same flavour I remember, but perhaps my taste buds have changed since way back then.Obviously nobody is buying this to replace a normal curry in 2020 [especially given the prep time], but if you wan't a journey back in time, this will absolutely deliver and also confirm that some kinds of progress are for the better!

My only issue is that when I am cleaning the floors the wipes don't stay put in the wipe holder on the mop and I do have to reattach several times but that's an issue with the mop design.

Ordered 2 and both lasted for about 1-2 hours.  Recharged them and the taste afterwards from both was absolutely sickening.  Also one of them recharged once and then died completely in the space of an hourBeen buying the same item locally now ever since this happened and have had no issues

Doesn't give 900 puffs, let alone 9000, they battery needed recharding after about 100 puffs, and then when I recharged it, had no flavour, and then wouldn't recharge again, cam with 100 puffs, recharged once for about the same amount of puffs without flavour, then that was it, not happy, not worth the money

The last phone you need to buy!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2024
The samsung s23 ultra has blown my mind for so many different reasons and I honestly don't think I will need to upgrade for at least 5-10 years (provided the battery lasts that long!)To start, the camera on this phone is like nothing iv ever used before. It captures photos 10 times better quality than my Samsung S20 did and that phone was no slouch! Video quality is also the best I have seen on a smart pone to date, I use it along side my high end consumer camcorder to create content and is quality is almost indistinguishable not to mention making my life so much easier with the portability.The battery life is also insane! I can use this monster all day long and still have some juice left when I go to charge it at night. This was one of the main reasons for upgrading and I am so glad I did.There is no glitchiness when scrolling or using apps, and the screen brightness is super bright and crisp.Conversations in calls are incredibly clear and I have synced with all my other samsung products, like watch and earbuds, with easeWith the newer s24 ultra about to launch, I would say save yourself an awful lot of money and buy this instead at a great price. The specs are identical in almost everything (the zoom feature on the s24 ultra is actually half the distance of what the s23 ultra is capable of!)The build quality is tremendous, and over the past year the phone has shown me how robust it is, taking bumps and scrapes in its stride, it shows next to no marks on it at all.If you are looking for a phone that will give you an incredible amount of features and execute all of them well, awesome specs, continue to get updates over the next few years, provide you with decent battery life and blow your current phone out the the water, then this is the phone for you

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 October 2019Style Name: Charge 3 Special EditionColour Name: Frost WhiteVerified Purchase
The Fitbit Charge 3 is an excellent fitness tracker and has well surpassed my expectations. The tracker is neat, comfortable and very useful. When deciding between this and the Versa, whilst the versa has more features, I chose this because of its smaller form factor, since I have smaller wrists.Some of the key features include auto exercise tracking, which has been fantastic for not losing my stats after I forget to press start on a run. I have found the heart rate to be pretty accurate and have tested against other heart rate monitors.I had mixed results with the sleep tracking, some nights it said I've slept 4 hours and other nights 10 hours, which both are incorrect, a friend who bought the same model a few months later, has no issues with this and her Fitbit shows a consistent 7-9 hours sleep each night. After contacting Fitbit support (who are very helpful!) they gave me some tips, I used to loosen it before sleeping, now I keep it the same tightness as during the day and the results are much more consistent.Other features include the relax/breathing tool, I haven't used this much, but others might find it a useful tool. Fitbit pay on the special edition is great, so handy to not have to get wallet or phone out pocket, especially whilst on a run.For the special edition, two straps with both sizes come in the box, I found the original strap too hard and it dug into my wrist leaving marks, I wasn't a fan of the white one, so bought the black sports strap which is much more comfortable and has enabled me to tighten it without any discomfort.Overall this tracker has really helped my health, the reminders to get up and move once an hour have been really great and being able to track water, does help too. If your looking for a fitness tracker and can't decide which one to get, you won't regret getting a Charge 3.

First time tracker - colour me impressed!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2019Style Name: Charge 3 Special EditionColour Name: Frost WhiteVerified Purchase
Had the product for approx. 3 months now, which I feel is ample time to give my thoughts and opinions on the product. Ill start by saying that I haven't used any other 'activity trackers' previously. Have used an android smartwatch previously, but of course, thats a different ballpark (few leagues down).Overall am very satisfied with the Fitbit Charge 3 and would recommend it to those who either are into fitness/sports or are getting into it - some may say get a cheap noname one, but having seen some in my family do that, I wouldn't recommend it. The feature set and implementation of hardware and especially software put this miles ahead.The Charge 3 is comfortable on my wrist, and unobtrusive during the day, when sleeping and during activity or sports. I enjoy the waterproofness of the product as it allows me to give it a proper clean every couple of days - using this for sport and wearing it more or less 24/7 means the area where the sensors sit and your wrist aren't exactly clean. Notifications work well on my Android device, although quick replies I have found not to work 100% using WhatsApp. You can customise the autoresponses which is good.The device has sustained a few knocks and whacks and so far seems to be standing strong with no visible signs of damage or fatigue. Where the Charge 3 really impresses me is with its HR and sleep tracking - very insightful, and appears to be reasonably accurate - the sleep tracking is much better and accurate compared to the Flex 2 (brothers tracker). The software is really easy to use, simply to set up, and generally one of the nicer UIs/experiences. Battery lasts me 6 days, consistently. Will go into the 7th day but requires a charge at that point. Impressed with speed of charging too, within 2hours up to 100%, with about 80% being charged within an hour?Have recently got the Aria 2 which supplements this well!

Superb activity tracker
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2023Style Name: Charge 3 Special EditionColour Name: Frost WhiteVerified Purchase
Very good bit of kit from Fitbit - smart design and lots on extras including pulse/activity/sleep tracking. GPS is only available if you have your phone with you which is a step down from modern versions like the Charge 5 which has GPS as a default. Fitbit Pay is really very convenient as well, and battery charge holds very well for at least 5 days. Was overall happy with this I must say, but the display suddenly faded to near invisible and so became unusable and hence it loses a star. Fitbit customer support quite excellent in helping around such issues including getting a newer model. There are a few of these still lurking but should be compared in price/facilities against the newer versions.

Generally I love the watch tracker. It’s very stylish, and has a great design for closing the strap on the white version. The sleep tracker is amazing and very informative as is the app on my iPhone. Not completely convinced yet by the step count accuracy as this increased when I was lying in bed; just settling down I suspect. Looking forward to trying the swim function but not till late April as pool too cold just now. All in all a great purchase.

Brilliant watch, few tweaks to be made
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 March 2020Style Name: Charge 3 Special EditionColour Name: Frost WhiteVerified Purchase
Brilliant product, love that it’s waterproof and is comfortable to wear. My main issues with it are, the screen display could benefit from staying lit for longer. There could also be more options for clock display. In terms of the performance, the stopwatch is quite sensitive and can pause if you knock it. The straps are comfortable but I find that the material can create an odour if you don’t wash the strap every other day. Overall I am happy with this product but these are the tweaks I would make if I could.

 My football mad son got this for Christmas and has loved using it. It is a toy and a tool to aid him in his football training. Can already see the difference in his footwork since using it. He loves beating his top score, and also loves competing with his brother too. I love that it keeps him off of devices and keeps him active when it’s raining outside whilst also staying on the floor (rather than balls flying through the air accross my living room!). I really recommend this for all ages, as my 11 year old also loves playing with it when his little brother lets him! So glad we got one before they sold out.

Don't waste your money
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2024Verified Purchase
Ordered this in November (plenty of time for a Christmas present) for my son.Opened on Christmas day and my son was very disappointed, set up as per instructions (new batteries in both the bot and the ball) didn't do anything it was supposed to, drove in a straight line past the ball and out of the play area (the 4 green discs) into the wall constantly. Tried for about 2 hours to get it to work correctly with no success, simply wasn't responding to the ball or the play area, had to explain to my son why Father Christmas had delivered a faulty toy for a present!!Contacted Golden Bear Toys (the manufacturer) who's response proved to be pretty poor, sending instructions on how to set up and to make sure we'd put new batteries in bot and ball (which I'd done for 2 hours on Christmas day morning and was stated on the email sent to them) and if still not working they would exchange but wouldn't be able to until March which is unacceptable for a replacement Christmas present for a child, very poor!Won't be wasting money on another or any other Golden Bear Toy products in the future, stay well clear!

From disappointment to happiness
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 December 2023Verified Purchase
Bought as a Christmas present for my son,, on Christmas Day the only thing it did was spin around like a drunken R2-D2, much to our disappointment.However...I spent an hour or so online to see if this was a common issue and if there was an easy fix before returning it. Turns out the fix was simple, it appeared only two AAA batteries fitted the ball, it was three!Shame the instructions don't include this detail as I appear not to be alone in making this mistake.Once I had fitted the third battery on Boxing Day, mu son gave it another go and instantly Soccerbot started chasing the ball and he played happily with it as much as he could. Talk about a 180 turnaround, from disappointment to happiness, it was only a AAA battery away..

⚠️ Play it, you will love it, guaranteed 100% ⚠️
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2019Verified Purchase
I've never really been interested in this type of game before, Im more FPS games like CoD etc. I saw the 1st RDR game and wasn't interested even a little. I just thought it was another silly cowboy game that I had no interest in. I bought it for my fiance as he wanted it and that was that. After a few hours of him playing it I found myself keep stopping what I was doing and watching. 5 mins would become 10 then half an hour would become an hour I just found myself engaged in the story and the characters. So I decided I was going to give it a go. I'm so glad I did I absolutely loved it.The graphics are stunning and you can choose to play in either 1st or 3rd person. This game takes place before RDR. The story is about the gang before the original RDR and gives you a better idea of all the characters history prior to the original. In this one however you play as a character called Arthur, a friend of John and Dutch etc.The game starts in the snowy mountains as you and the gang are on the run looking for a place to stay. This first chapter has alot of cinematics and cut screens. This helps you get used to the controls and game play. Riding horses, shooting, lasooing hiding from enemies etc if your not too familiar with this, this is helpful. The main story in this game is outstanding. It's about being on the run and trying to make or steal enough money to find a safe place for you and your gang to call home. The game is full of twists and turns and ups an downs, one minute your robbing a bank with your gang and then at the opposite end your all riding out to get back a kidnapped child. It really is an emotional roller-coaster.Aside from the main story the game has so much to offer. Around the map you will meet treasure hunters and you can buy or steal their maps. You can help a paleontologist find dinosaur bones, you can help catch a serial killer, you can help a very interesting traveller with his strange rock wall carvings. There are alien spaceships to be seen even a ghost train if your in the right place at the right time. There is a hidden giant you can talk too and plenty more surprises to be founds. You can even catch a vampire by following mysterious messages left on walls. Just to name a few. There is so much to discover and plenty of points of interest you will not get bored. Then on top of all that there are puzzles that reward you with gold bars. These are great for selling and can make you alot of money. You can fish and hunt too. These can be sold for money to but can also be used at the trappers hut for upgrades to clothing, health, stamina and even horse boosts. You can also donate animals/pelts to your camp for money, camp upgrades and food. Around the map you will find people you can play dominoes, five finger fillet, black jack or poker with for a bit of extra cash.The game can be played with Arthur as a good guy or the bad guy or a little of both. You have an honour scale so you can see how different decisions affect your honour. How you play is entirely your choice, however if you choose to be bad (dishonourable) people are more fearful of you and stores charge you more for purchases. However being a good guy (honourable) will get you some nice discounts in stores around the towns. Different towns have different store types. Where you can top up on ammo, food, new clothes even fish bait. You also have the option to bathe. Your choice entirely, however bathing does increase your stamina. Food in this game is an important factor. Eat too much and you can become overweight, this affects stamina but increases the amount of damage you can take. Not enough food and you can move faster but you can take less damage. Or you can keep it average try to stay down the middle.The game is fantastic, it's brilliant, it's beautiful and it's emotional. It has been well thought out and well written. Even down to the choice of music. I absolutely loved it and I hope they make another one. It would be nice to go even further back to before this one. I thoroughly enjoyed the game, I did everything I could before the switch to Texas area until all I could do was continue the story. I completed the game and challenges 100% and thought the little cinematic at the end for 100% completion was a nice touch. A fantastic amount of playing time for the price.We now have 3 copies of this in our house because nobody wanted to wait for someone else to stop playing. I highly recommend it to anyone. Brilliant game, just brilliant.Thank you for reading my review and I hope this was helpful to you 👍

Phenomenal
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2021Verified Purchase
I've not really played video games for years.  I recently got a PS4 and this was the first game i bought.  Wow.  It is, simply, extraordinary.You play a member of an outlaw gang, on the run from a robbery gone wrong.  You start high in the mountains, snowed in but safe.  Then as the thaw comes you move down into more hospitable land.  This is when the game comes alive.  The scale and detail of the world is extraordinary.  You can go pretty much anywhere, do pretty much anything,  There are characters all over the place.  Some will just say good morning to you, others might try to rob you, yet more will give you missions (finding dinosaur bones, rare plants and the like).  There are loads of missions, loads to do.  Enough for dozens - hundreds? - of hours of play.And yet.The doing is not the point of this game.  Being is the point of this game.  You get to spend time in the wild west, just as it starts to get tamed.  The first time I visited the large town that has electricity and trams I was shocked.  I was so used to the spit and sawdust of Valentine.  You get horses and need to bond with them, feed them, groom them.  You need to provide money for the camp so everyone can eat, and you need to eat yourself.  You travel across a stunningly beautiful world.  You leave footprints in the snow and mud.  When it's cold, you can see your breath and you need to put on a warm coat.  You can kill and skin animals to feed the camp.  You can cut your hair, buy new clothes, shave.  You can be friendly or nasty.  You can help people or kill them and loot their bodies.  It's amazing, immersive and utterly compelling and absorbing.  It's unlike anything I've ever seen before.  You should buy it. Now.  And play it for weeks.  The scenery alone is worth the price of admission.The best one line review of it I saw just said ""It's like Rockstar decided to move a video game version of Deadwood"".  It's that good.

Lovely controller
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2023Platform For Display: PlayStation 5Edition: Dualsense Midnight BlackVerified Purchase
I purchased this as a second controller for my PS5, to use while one charges to save me having to use a controller with a cable attached.I already knew what to expect as I have been using the original controller for some time - and this met all those expectations. It worked properly, was a well packaged, brand new controller in perfect condition.Out of habit, I use rubber thumbstick grips on my controllers (going back to a flaw when DualShock 4 controls initially launched) although I don't think this is required, as I haven't encountered or heard of any issues with the thumbsticks on the DualSense controllers.It would have been nice if the controller included a USB C charging cable for the purposes of initially connecting it to the console, or for those who will be using the cable to charge, although I have a 2 controller charging dock so this isn't much of an inconvenience for myself.The DualSense itself is a comfortable controller that feels weighty and solid, with a high quality build. It's got a lot of cool features, such as tensioning the R2 trigger on applicable games (I encountered this when firing a bow on Assassin's Creed Valhalla) but this can be customised or disabled if it's not for you. The controller holds the charge well, and operates effectively, as expected.

Pain to charge, mushy buttons
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2021Platform For Display: PlayStation 5Edition: Dualsense Midnight BlackVerified Purchase
I struggle to find any advantages over the PS4 controller, and feel Sony have nerfed this controller. I don't see why it couldn't be allowed to connect to PS4, as PS4 controllers are around the same price still, and this late in the game, I'm not gonna buy a PS4 controller for my PC, when one day I'll have a PS5 and require a second controller for that.So so far I've not been able to test the feedback triggers due to a lack of a PS5 and not having Metro Exodus on PC. I can't believe Sony still haven't released a dedicated PC driver, having to still rely on DS4Windows to make their peripherals work, which atleast that software allows me to map additional functions to the touchbar. My PS4 controller profile worked perfectly fine on the PS5, which was nice.Right side buttons feel mushy and don't have enough travel, essentially feels like a madcatz controller when compared to the tactile feel of the PS4 buttons. D-pad is average. Analogue sticks feel to have the same sensitivity/resistance as PS4 sticks, though I'd say there's a tiny bit of grating on the right stick, so the engineering tolerances are nothing to write home about. The construction of the case isn't my favourite, with seams in places I'd rather not be as you can feel them, specially the flat edge at the bottom of each side. The overall shape is that of the Xbox One style, though atleast the trigger buttons depress properly into the case, rather than leaving big open holes as the xbox does.It's much more weighty, which if I'm not currently getting any use out of the adaptive triggers, becomes annoying. Not sure if there is a bigger battery in this as usage seems to be on par with PS4 battery life.I think the inclusion of a mic mute button is a good idea, though I think it also could have benefitted with some built-in volume controls.The biggest issue I have with this controller is being able to charge it. I don't have a PS5 to directly charge it off, so was trying to rely on an Amazon basic 10 port usb hub, which unfortunately couldn't provide enough power. I then found out that a Samsung, an Oculus and a generic usb wall socket charger also couldn't provide the right conditions for the controller to charge. After much tracking, I finally found a USB port on my TV and the usb ports on my laptop was capable of charging the controller. After further investigation, I found that anything that provided more than 0.2V on data - line of a usb port prevented the controller from charging. No idea why this is. Whether you need to short your data - line to ground to get your preferred charger to work, but I imagine this will be something Sony will quietly fix in their next iteration. (I would say the PS4 controller doesn't have this issue, but sadly this also suffered with powercycling itself if the micro usb cable was moved whilst plugged into a USB port that wasn't power only).Overall it's useable, but not an improvement of the PS4 controller like the DS4 was over DS3.

I have grown up on PlayStation and PC but solely switch to PC a few years back.I still like to play some games with a controller and the dualsense works perfectly on my PC (As long as you don't mind some Xbox prompts in some games)Only PlayStation titles natively support haptics but they do work when they advertise them. The controller feels great in the hands and is the best controller Sony has releasedI have had an issue when I dropped my controller, the Start button did get stuck under the plastic which I did have to open the controller to pop it back into place. However that is the only ""Hardware"" issue i've had.I did wish Sony would support a way for Audio to work via bluetooth on the controller, you will have be cabled in for this but all other features seem to work fine via bluetooth.

I finally chose to get a new fitness/smart watch after my old one broke.This I'd such a good watch, considering its a few years old.Heart rate, steps, body composition, sleep tracking..  there's so much it can do.I personally wasn't a fan of the strap it comes with.  It's wide, and actually really difficult to change.  I bought a few cheap replacements and you can really make it fit your style.Excellent display.  You can set photos as your watch screen.  Plenty of apps you can download.Gets your notifications too, which is amazing! You can reply to texts and answer calls on the watch.Sure there are newer models, but this does everything I wanted it to do.

As far as I know the samsung 5 Pro will be the best in terms if battery life. But im still impressed with the ease of use, and the technology too, lots of updates of software. I find its basically the same as a samsung phone as a smart watch all the same features. I've used a lot of generic smart watches and they were a waste of time and money often not syncing properly or partially or not at all and are disappointing.

= Two pin adaptors: Better than three pins! =The people who complain that this plug lacks three prongs are missing the point of this brilliant little thing. The three pin plugs only work in a select few countries like the USA. Two pin plugs like this one work in both grounded countries and ungrounded countries (e.g. USA vs Japan). Most of the plugs used in grounded countries are two pin anyway.Beware of the many three pin adaptors that claim they work in Japan, Taiwan etc. They don't!!A few new buildings in North America use TRR sockets with a shutter like another reviewer posted. These are a bit more difficult to plug into regardless of whether you are using a native plug or this adapter. Sometimes it needs a bit of a jiggle.= This particular adaptor =I usually buy brand-name adaptors to ensure they're of a decent quality. Decided to try these and was pleasantly surprised. The plastic is a bit light and hollow, but they are well moulded and reasonably attractive. They are also fairly compact for UK to Type A adaptors, which is great because it leaves you clearance to plug something else in. However, even these are still slightly too big to allow you to plug two of them into a normal Type A dual socket. I reckon they can shave another 5mm off the footprint of these, and then they'd be perfect!I've inserted many UK plugs into these and they all fit snug and well. These aren't like some cheap adaptors that lack safety shutters. You just need to press the plug firmly in place.All in all, very happy with the purchase :)

Got this for our nephew, he loves playing fifa when he comes over on the PlayStation and he has had one of the older versions on switch for a while so we thought wed treat him.Just be wary, he is 9 so he has a Nintendo account with parental controls. We mainly bought this for him so he could play with us and his uncles online when he is at home and not with us, but he is restricted to online content until he is 13 years old, although we set permissions that he could play it. It’s not the games fault, but I just wanted to advise people of this incase you are buying it for the same purpose as we did.The game is brilliant on switch though, plays well and graphics are good. Would definitely buy on the switch again (if they were making any more!)

Extremely disappointed, did not work with no release of toy.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2024Style Name: BluePattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
Purchased this for my 5yr old granddaughter as that s what she really wanted for her birthday. It arrived today and she was so excited to open it and see it working. Unfortunately although several adults followed the instructions to the letter the toy would not reveal. It sounded like the motor was stuck. Tried resetting it several times and although the wand, mist and lights appeared to work ok when you tried to reveal the toy it always stayed stuck beneath the globe and there is no way to get into it without dismantling it so I’ve had to return it as faulty leaving one extremely disappointed 5yr old who was in tears. Should have read other reviews prior to ordering as there seems to be a lot of other people with very similar problems.

Dylon's Intense Black Dye Pod: A Daring Adventure for Your Wardrobe 🕶️🖤
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2024Colour Name: Intense BlackSize Name: 350 g (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
Prepare to embark on a bold and captivating journey with Dylon's Intense Black Dye Pod! This little powerhouse promises to breathe new life into your faded and drab fabrics, transforming them into fierce, statement pieces that demand attention. 💥From the moment I unleashed the concentrated black dye into my washing machine, I knew I was in for an exhilarating ride. The all-in-1 formula effortlessly revived my once-vibrant cotton and linen garments, enveloping them in a rich, inky hue that oozed sophistication and edginess. 🔥However, as with any daring endeavor, there were a few challenges to overcome. While the dye pod worked wonders on natural fibers, it struggled to leave a lasting impression on synthetic materials. My polyester pieces emerged with a slightly faded, lackluster shade, causing me to mourn the missed opportunity for a full-on goth transformation. 😕Another aspect that deserves a mention is the intensity of the black hue itself. Be prepared for a no-holds-barred, unapologetically dark result. This dye means business, and if you're not ready to fully commit to the dark side, you might find yourself overwhelmed by the depth of the color. 👻Despite these minor setbacks, the ease of use and convenience of Dylon's Intense Black Dye Pod cannot be overstated. No more fussing with messy powders or liquid dyes – simply toss the pod into your washing machine and let the magic unfold. Plus, with its impressive dyeing capacity of up to 600g, you can rejuvenate a substantial portion of your wardrobe in one go. 💯In conclusion, if you're seeking a bold and dramatic transformation for your cotton, linen, or viscose pieces, Dylon's Intense Black Dye Pod is a must-try. Just brace yourself for the intensity of the color and be mindful of the limitations with synthetic fabrics. Embrace the darkness, and let your wardrobe make a statement that truly resonates. 🌑💥

Works well, but be prepared to clean washing machine after
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 April 2024Colour Name: Intense BlackSize Name: 350 g (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I have used dylon machine dyes before, but a long time ago. Have also used the ones that can be done in a basin or bucket. I think the machine dye is much easier to use, and probably gets more reliable results.I can't fault the dye job (I did 2 t-shirts in one go), except that one item now has contrasting stitching which doesn't look great (not the fault of the dye, it states that other fabrics will not take the dye and I guess the stitching is polyester rather than cotton). Other than that, they both look great.My main gripe is how long it took to clean all the black dye out of the rubber door gasket in my washing machine. It literally took about 20 minutes with cleaning spray and almost half a roll of kitchen towel, each time I wiped around the inner bit of the door seal the paper towel came out jet black. Repeat about 20 times until the paper no longer comes out covered in jet black grime!Again, not really a product fault as such, just be aware that this will probably be required to be sure that no dye remains to stain items in subsequent washes.

Wish I'd taken a before picture but this stuff worked brilliantly. I had some really good black jeggings I've had over a year and they had faded to grey. The fading was horrendous. They are a polyester, cotton and elastane mix. They came out looking like brand new jet black. Completely given them a new lease of life and they look smart again!Only grievance was the instructions were in the tiniest font and difficult to read but a quick Google yielded the instructions. Popped some old grey towels etc in the follow up wash to make sure ant residue in the machine is gone.Highly recommend. Much more thrifty to redye my favourite jeggings over spending £30 on a new pair. Will definitely be buying again.

Expecting pitch black or any accurate result from these (even on very porous and easily dyed materials) is rather hopeful. Though you may be pleasantly surprised. If you are hoping to match the resulting colours with an outfit which you have not yourself dyed, the chances are probably slim that it will be the same. Colour mixing is complex.The end result is usually even though perhaps less strong than I would have liked.Perhaps our washing machines have some sway on the end result though.Easy to do and worth a shot to bring an old or unworn piece back to life

A handy, time-saving machine for parents.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 February 2016Colour: WhiteVerified Purchase
This is a fantastic idea. I have been through the stage of having to boil the kettle, wait for it to cool, or make the milk hot and fill a jug of water several times until it is cool enough, sometimes with a hysterically crying baby. The machine really does do the job. The instructions are easy to follow, no tricky steps to remember. Less fuss, just fresh milk at the perfect temperature.When you first get the Perfect Prep, you have to go through a first time set up, but once this is done, you need not do it again unless you don't use the machine for more than 2 days. Tip - you really do need a big container to catch all the water that is filtered through the machine the first time, otherwise you will end up with wet worktops/floors, trust someone who knows!The design is excellent - nice, clear indicators for water level, filter status, cleaning, and maintenance. The red LED's will illuminate to alert you if there is an issue, and these are easy to see. The spacing for small and large bottles is sufficient, and you can move the drip tray to suit the required bottle.When making the milk, you must first put in hot water. This is generally enough to dissolve all the milk powder. Whilst you're mixing the water and powder, you have a small time window to add the rest of the water. I find that there is enough time to do this. If you take too long mixing, the machine will beep, which means it's no longer possible to add the rest of the water as it isn't effective by then. Once the rest of the water is added, it easily mixes with the rest of the milk. The temperature is just right. My baby has never had a problem drinking it straight away.The machine can be quite loud when in use, but it isn't enough to be a nuisance. It seems like a standard feature of water dispensing machines, as my coffee machine makes roughly the same noise. My baby likes to watch the machine whilst we wait for the bottle to fill, he seems pleased with it as he knows his milk is coming.After a while you will need to replace the filter. So far though, I have not personally had to replace mine. The filter warning light came on, so I bought a replacement filter. The filter light will start flashing (rather than remain solid) if it needs to be immediately replaced. My replacement filter has been sat in a cupboard for weeks as the light is not yet flashing. This means there is plenty of time to get a replacement filter if needed.Aside from making milk, I have found this machine generally useful for dispensing water when you need to use 'boiled, cooled' water in certain situations. I have been able to mix my baby's Gaviscon and provide drinking water this way.I am very happy with this product and will be passing it along when I have finished with it.

Best thing for mummy's with newborns
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 August 2015Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
at first I didn't believe it would be that amazing, but after struggling night in and night out with a screaming baby whilst waiting for bottles too cool down enough to be drank, I gave in and finally payed the (what I originally thought was) ridiculous pricing for this piece of equipment. It arrived the very next day in which I selected and I ordered the item in black.Firstly it looks smart, it isn't overly big either so would fit on most surfaces and it's not something you really have to put together. The instructions included are clear, easy to read and have great pictures to show how things are done.Before I could use my perfect prep machine i had to run a cleaning process which was very quick and simple and didn't need anything major for it.There are also tons of buttons down the side that light up if the water is too hot, the machine needs descaling, is running low on water etc etc. this is so handy! It also tells you when the filter needs changing.Now.. Here is the best bit.So say I want to make a 6oz bottle.Usually I would have to boil the kettle, pour it in a bottle, shake it without burning my hands, and then wait 20 minutes for the bottle too cool down whilst my daughter is persistent on screaming until it is ready..With the perfect prep, you can set the machine to pour 6 oz, but no worries if next time you only decide to do 4, you just change the dial, so simple and easy, almost like an old fashioned telephone!The machine then releases a hot shot, you then add your formula powder. This hot shot is a shot of boiling water that goes in the bottle to dispose of any bacteria in the powder. You have 2 minutes to add the powder or it will not let you continue to make that feed as after that two minutes, if you haven't added powder, the hot shot would had cooled down too much and won't do its job, a handy tool again. Then after you've added your powder you press the button again and the rest of the water is added, but this time at perfect room temp. When the bottle is complete the prep machine beeps to let you know. You then shake the bottle and test it on your wrist! Although I can guarantee it will be at the perfect temperature for your baby. This is all completed in roughly 1 minute. It's so quick, so easy, so clean and so smart.I now believe that it was worth every single penny I payed and I would recommend to any mums still using formula or have newborns. Especially new mums! Don't make the work harder for yourself! But this! It won't let you down.

First dryer brush. I’ve used GHD curling tongs before which are great - but it pulls my hair. I don’t have the dexterity to handle the brush and hairdryer itself, so this seemed like the best solution. The babyliss is a firm favourite with friends but it wasn’t strong enough for my hair. I’m a redhead with fine, alternately wavy, curly hair. This is amazing! I only use second heat and in 10 minutes, my hair is perfect. Smooth, loose curls. Easy, not damaged and dry. Like going to the hair dresser. The bristles are the perfect rigidity and don’t pull my hair. So impressed!

However, I could not be happier that I took the plunge and ordered it.I find it easy to hold, and the fact that you can support the other end to distribute the weight makes it very manageable.

It took me a few goes to be able to master using the brush and getting a smooth bouncy look. It dries my fine flyaway hair in double quick time and my hair looks salon fresh when I’ve finished. I ensure I use a moisture rich shampoo and an absolute must is a heat defence spray before drying.The only thing I worry about is how hot the air is that is pushed out. It seriously burns if you’re not careful, especially around the ears and nape of the neck. There seems very little difference in temperature  between the cool shot and high heat setting. It’s also very noisy!That said, I wouldn’t be without it.

Salon style results
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 February 2024Style Name: BoosterVerified Purchase
I am so glad I went ahead and purchased this, despite trying many similar blow dryer brushes/stylers in the past, which were all disappointing for one reason or another. Yes, this gets incredibly hot, but there is no need to use it on the highest setting. Personally I use it on the very lowest (cool shot) as I have fine, thin and fragile hair and don't want to damage it any further. The lowest temperature is not cold as you would expect, but warm. Warm enough to dry and style your hair, after you have let it dry around 80% beforehand. You still get a lot of power on this setting.The thing I love most of all about this styler is the way it can shape your hair. I have collar bone length hair with layers, and this turns them under like no other brush does or heat tool that I have tried. It really shapes your layers, keeping them looking neat and tidy and like you've just stepped out of a salon after a blowout. Fantastic. Hair looks frizz free and shiny too, which is a big plus. Take a look at people using this product on YouTube, and you will see they get great results, every single time. I have not tried to curl my hair with this yet, so can't comment on how well it curls your hair, but I am excited to see how that goes and will update my review on the results of that. I really can't recommend this highly enough, and the price is so much more reasonable than other similar products you can buy, that are nowhere near as good as this.

I had my long hair cut  in to a shoulder length bob recently and have always hated drying my hair with a brush and hairdryer.This machine is absolutely brilliant and I cannot fault it. It takes all the hassle out of drying short hair and I actually use it on my little girls hair to dry as it's less harsh than a normal hairdryer. I recommended it to my mum and she bought one and loves it equally as much. If the end look is too curled under then I just use my straighteners to flatten it out a little but you don't actually need them for the sleek look as you already have that with this product. Nothing more to say than 'excellent' and I wouldn't be without it now.

Good quality, good flavour with milk
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2024Flavour Name: StrawberryVerified Purchase
I originally tried it with water and seemed to have over diluted it and it didn't taste the best because obviously it was water, so I would recommend it with milk despite the creatine content especially for bulking. As for the portion size, it doesn't seem as though you're getting a lot for your money especially when you think about the size of the tub and the price you're paying as you only get 8 full servings, but the tub is full and can probably last you a while on a balanced intake. This also makes it cheaper when comparing to some other protein drinks.

Strawberry shake is SOOOO good!!!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2024Flavour Name: StrawberryVerified Purchase
Il start by saying I never leave reviews on anything but I absolutely had to write one for this! I read all the reviews before buying and there wasn’t many on the strawberry flavor so I felt I took a risk, I’m so glad I did!! It tastes amazing if your a fan of the strawberry Angel delight pudding then you will love this it tastes exactly the same!! I can’t wait to have my shake everyday because I enjoy it so much, iv tried a few different brands and they always leave a powdery taste in my mouth and a not so nice aftertaste this is nothing like that it’s so yummy!! Please bear in mind I mix mine with milk not water! I definitely recommend I will be buying this on repeat!The only thing that surprised me was the scoop size it’s huge!!! I imagine I will get through it quite fast but to be honest with the amount of calories and protein and the flavor I don’t care! It’s worth it happy customer :)

I had ordered the same but in vanilla, it was absolutely revolting and it smelled and tasted like a bunch of chemicals I really tried to convince myself it wasn’t that bad but no matter what i mixed it with it was terrible hence why i switched to the strawberry and it tastes amazing, it tastes just like the strawberry nesquick or like a strawberry milkshake. It doesn’t smell chemically at all despite the many reviews where it says it does and in myopinion it’s the best flavour out of all of them and i think it’s a lot easier to drink if you’re not too keen on using enhancing products like serious mass since you’ll actually enjoy the taste and personally it motivated me to drink it more often and stick to it.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 September 2023Verified Purchase
This is the best nasal spray to use to stop you from continuously sneezing. I do go through quite a lot of these from around March-Sept as I use it twice daily (8 total sprays), but it really does the job, I barely sneeze throughout the summer months now.Just remember, when you spray this into your nose, you’re NOT supposed to inhale hard, as it will just roll straight down the back of your throat. It’s supposed to stay around your nose to work effectively! So just lightly sniff several times so that it doesn’t roll down your nose.Take these alongside Allacan hay fever tablets and you’re set! No sneezing or itchy eyes, perfect combo for hayfever sufferers.

i have suffered with hay fever for only the last few years, im a dog walker and spend almost all day in the parks / up the downs where pollen lives and it was making me so stressed to be constantly sneezing / face swollen / eyes blowing up / not being able to see, and actually debated scrapping the whole thing and just hibernating in the summer. i even started wearing face masks on dog walks in hopes of keeping the pollen away. i tried loads of things, local honey, vaseline around the nostrils, different brands and doses of antihistamine, nothing was working and it made me quite depressed! i tried this and it’s changed everything, it’s best used as a preventative but also works in an emergency in an attack. i can walk through fields and parks again and not get so much as a sniffle. huge relief, im definitely going to be buying loads this summer!! everyone’s different but it’s definitely worth a try, would 100% recommend.

Works well to help and prevent hay fever
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2023Verified Purchase
I suffer from bad hay fever and was taking two antihistamines and at a loss until someone recommended this product along with sodium cromogligate(?) eye drops.I use two sprays in each nostril in the morning and before bed to help prevent and treat my hay fever symptoms. You just have to make sure to blow your nose beforehand then take deep breaths through your nose as you inhale the spray, then continue to breathe through the nostril for a few breaths afterwards. Sometimes I find the product goes into my mouth via my nose (unsure how this works due to anatomy stuff) but it doesn’t taste bad, vaguely sweet and not adverse at all. Price is normally six but can get for four on sale if I’m lucky and normally stock up a few for the year. One bottle I think lasts maybe a month.

Given time you'll grow to love the Pixel 5
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 November 2020Verified Purchase
What's sheerness? Even looking it up didn't cast much light - to cause to swerve from course?! Is it, its attractiveness? I'll probably never know.Getting back to the matter of the review, I've had to wait three weeks before giving mine because my first impressions were very mixed. I loved the smaller size which is easier to use with one hand and the camera was top notch. I used to take loads of pictures in the past with massive dslr cameras and in a way I think this is reminding me of that again. Let's see how far it goes.On the other hand, the Pixel 5 was the first phone I've got where I wasn't over the moon about it. As you probably already know from other sources, this phone isn't exactly brimming with top notch tech for a 'flagship'. Even the camera I lauded is working off four year old kit! My outgoing two year old OnePlus 6T felt smoother and slicker in places. Every now I then I'd get a stutter on the Pixel 5 and I couldn't help wonder if it was just a glitch or if the processor was struggling to keep up. Something, I seldom experienced on the OnePlus 6T. However, that phone and its manufacturer is a separate story for another time.Well, if you're still with me then this is the really good part. Despite its glaring technical weaknesses, the phone somehow just works. There's an attention to detail you start to notice after using it for a while that I have not seen in an Android phone in a really long time - the HTC Desire (circa 2010) brings to mind. The little flourishes all seem to make the sum more than the individual parts. Naming that song is built into the lock screen and just works without me frantically unlocking my phone and looking for Shazam or some other app. The voice assistant does so much more without requiring me to unlock the phone or giving it superpowers to do so. I've probably used it more on this phone than any other. The home screen is clean and somehow it manages to provide the info I need. Or, it's a tap away.Some may start screaming privacy and that I'm the product but after a lot of experimentation with other solutions, I've thrown my lot in with Google's Android - they're really good and little wonder they dominate in so many spaces. Except for the keyboard where I use SwiftKey which is brilliant.Getting real, the pricing and the promotional Bose headphones tipped me over the edge with pre-ordering the phone. But, its taken me nearly three weeks to really grow to love this device. Its also the first mobile device that I believe Google hasn't messed up. I look forward to what the Pixel 6 and 7 bring to the table.If you're still undecided just go for it but give the device time to work its magic on you....

A decent Google phone
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2021Verified Purchase
I absolutely love the battery life and the usual smoothness from a pure Android. Coming from Pixel 2XL, this phone is hand-friendly, not too big or small, just nice for my hand to hold and use with 1 hand. I do not have to stretch my fingers too much across the screen. Though it uses a premium mid-range processor, I do not see any lagging when using the phone. It is decent enough to get my things done on the phone. Camera image is as just as good from a Google phone. Speaker is a little disappointing for me as I missed my Pixel 2 2-speaker setup. Colour on screen is a nice and huge improvement compared to Pixel 2. No complains on its build quality as of now. I have no regrets with buying this phone. Hope that it can last me for more than 2 years.

Never received headphones offer.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2020Verified Purchase
Reduced to one star as the company Google used for the free headphone offer are a complete scam. They were supposed to arrive withing 60 days but they have not. Clearly a dodgy company and Google will not help me with my claim even though it is a Google offer.I'll probably keep this because the size is better for me than all the other huge flagships, but there are a few issues.As another review said, the speakers are embarassingly bad.The device feels great in hand and the UI is generally smooth.However, I have already noticed it starting to struggle when doing other heavy tasks due to the low-tier storage and processor. For example, trying to rotate a YouTube video whilst playing has a few seconds' delay. Night mode and portrait photos take much longer to process than other phones, and you'll notice slow-downs in animations when your phone is doing its daily app-updates.If you're not an intense user, you'll probably love this phone, but if you're into gaming and use your phone to edit videos, this is probably not the phone for you.The camera is the usual Pixel standard: great. However, the competition have caught up and I now find this takes blurrier photos of moving subjects than Samsung or iPhone. I'd guess due to Google sticking with their usual 4-year old sensor instead of a modern one like the competition.Basically, this device is 'good', but not great. This is a £400 device with a £200 premium for having the 'Google' name attached. There isn't really enough here to separate it from the confusingly similar, but cheaper Pixel 4a 5g, so I'd probably go for that if you're happy with a larger phone.

Really good product
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2023Verified Purchase
I saw lot of mixed reviews for this, so to be specific I bought the 40""...So, I deliberated for a long time about spending the best part of £!50 on some sheet metal. I was worried about build quality and if this would do anything  to help my badly rutted lawn. I also worried about the size - would the edges catch/snag, and give me something unusable?Pleased to say the following:Not sure what the build quality complaints are about - seems very solid to me. The metal on the handle very thick. The head is also sturdy - no flexing. I think it might be stainless. It's heavy, so I don't think it's aluminium. The welding also looks decent (wetted all the way through).I'm sure people have different methods, but I mixed top soil and sharp sand (70/30). Put it down on the lawn, and used the rake to spread it. It doesn't snag (the corners are all rounded) and glides over nicely. There's enough weight to compact the mix, and gives you a nice smooth/flat finish in very little time.Looking forward to a nice, flat, lawn in 6 weeks!

If like me you wondered if this was worth it? Well it has been, the long handle makes it easy to use and covered my rather bumpy lawn (worms and ants) with ease. After a while I should have a more level lawn. The materials it is made of seem to be robust and stay clean. Your choice of material to spread around the lawn will help you with your use of this equipment. The width was something I considered and this wider version seem to help with the levelling and less undulation.Bit of a treat for me but but paid of as I had plenty of energy left after quickly completing the work.

I saw a device like this being used to level an existing lawn on YouTube so I looked for similar devices. This one seemed a little expensive but had the width I wanted. I was pleased with it, easy to use and did a good job. I was initially a little sceptical but it proved me wrong.

When you screw the three sections of pole together the handle at the end should bend down but unless I am missing something there is no way of orientating this.  Also, the rubber sleeves slide off too easily. But the lute works, it’s made of stainless so for £100 it’s good value for money.

My Echo Pop Love Story
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2024Colour Name: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device OnlyVerified Purchase
The Echo Pop in Lavender Bloom has been nothing short of a revelation for our family, becoming a cherished addition to my children's room. As my third purchase, it's clear I can't get enough of its compact design and the full, rich sound it delivers, despite its size. The seamless Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, along with Alexa's smart features, make it a versatile companion for any room. What truly sets it apart for me, however, is its nightly role as a lullaby player, gently coaxing my children into dreamland with its soothing melodies. It's more than a speaker; it's a nightly ritual that brings peace and comfort to my kids, making bedtime something we all look forward to. The Echo Pop has exceeded my expectations, blending perfectly with our family's needs and routines.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2024Verified Purchase
I found this ok, not quite as good as claimed. Ok so this is expensive and I was hoping that it would be amazing, not really and this is my honest opinion.  I found that to cover any imperfections you have to really layer and blend blend blend, I found it to look a bit cakey and it didn't really hide pores and it made me look over made up and sat in my creases. It tends to look a bit orange after a while too. It is hard to find the right shade and with the price of it, it's an expensive mistake to make. The product itself is powder but slightly creamy powder texture. I use my other cream foundation and put a light layer of this over the top to give my complexion a bit of colour ( I refuse to waste it lol). I don't think I would purchase it again.

For once I must review a product not worth buying. Awful texture, if lightly applied it doesn’t do anything, if layered up it clogs pores and highlights wrinkles. I do not normally use powders, but a combination of the cleverly put together marketing (it appeared on y insta feed as I use make up products for over 50s) and the incredible amount of good reviews made me want to try. It will be in the bin, with its packaging. Don’t waste your money.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2024Style Name: Media RemoteVerified Purchase
This media remote is a great little remote for when you use watching shows and movies on the ps5 and don't want to use the main gaming controller. It also can work with a tvs controls as it has ir in it as well as the bt for the ps5. So far I've used it quite a bit and it's great. My only issues with it are that it only comes in white and for a controller that's in your hands a lot white is going to show all andnany dirt that gets on it. Also the fact that the app buttons aren't reprogramable. While Sony probably got paid by them company's to make them the default apps on the controller. Not everyone uses them apps or atleast they aren't the main apps to be used. As I don't use YT and barely use Spotify on the ps5 so I would of loved to reprogram them to open another app like Prime or Plex.

Got a PS5? Got 2 controllers? Get one of these!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 November 2023Style Name: Charging StationVerified Purchase
I've always bought Sony official controllers and charging stations because they just work, and match the console perfectly. Keeps 2 controllers charging at all times, so you have a back up in case of extra long gaming sessions, but a perfect accessory even for a single controller.It's quite straightforward to  dock the controllers, giving you a gentle click when they have seated, and only takes a few hours to fully charge a controller.One thing to note, this station is powered via a normal power supply, so not USB. I've never had a problem with that as pretty much all my previous Sony docks have done the same, and I prefer that as I can plug it in anywhere, doesn't have to be next to my console.

I'm smashing the controls like a muppet trying to get the correct combo's during intense gameplay, often resulting in me having to walk away from it only to return a few moments later, even more determined. The story is excellent and highly cinematic; the cut scenes are great, too, and I never looked for the skip button once.I waited for ages to buy this, and I am so glad I did; it's a real winner.

Games are expensive,  sometimes I buy my son a game and he soon gets bored,  even if it's a cheap game that's such a waste.  This isn't a cheap game,  not by a long chalk,  but,  having played and loved the last 2 spiderman games I thought he would love this, so I bought it for him.  Now I won't let my natural modesty cloud this review,  it turns out I'm a genius and as predicted he loves this game,  I've had people see him play the game and say it looks like a movie,  which it does.  He;s had it a few weeks, played it a lot,  today he said a really sad thing happened,  I got onto the next level and the game told me it was the last level.  He's now planning to go back and make sure he's done all the side  missions, and got the best scores possible to try to get his progress to 100%.  Not a cheap game,  but a great game,  the people who built it deserve our support,  and it's worth every penny in fun and play time.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 February 2024Edition: SingleVerified Purchase
Pre-ordered the game to get it on the release date after enjoying the first Spiderman, and the second one was just as outstanding. The plot was very engaging, focusing on both Peter and Miles. One of the main parts of Peter's story was the impact on himself and other characters, like Miles, Harry, and Mary Jane, when he gets the black suit, a very unique part. New villains were a great addition to the game, especially Kraven and Venom for the main story, and Mysterio, Sandman, and Chameleon for side missions. Managed to platinum the game within a month, well worth £60, and a brilliant sequel. Hope theres a Spiderman 3 at some point in the future, the ending of this game suggests that Norman Osborn, and possibly the Green Goblin, will be a big part.

Great gameplay, good story but a few drawbacks
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 October 2023Edition: SingleVerified Purchase
Spiderman 2 is the third entry in this game series and offers a lot of positives.Gameplay - With both Peter Parker and Miles Morales being playable characters, there is more variations in moves and skills which is keeps things fresh for longer, new gadgets have replaced the previous ones, this is more to fit the new enemies and combat than anything else. Some new introductions improve the game such as the web wings and the symbiote powers, makes travelling quicker ,offers some variation and can be lots of fun. The gameplay is a highlight of this entry.Story (No spoilers) - The story mostly worked for me, each character has their own story arch. Some good villians, Harry is a welcome addition to the series. The voice acting and performances are superb.Side quests - Two side quests are stand outs, the flame quests and Mysterio, the remaining are collectibles and often feel like filler.Technical - The game performs very well, graphics are high quality and felt consistent with its performance for 99%, some frames rate drops on a single cut scene was noticable.Bugs - Playing with day one patch, I did encounter some bugs, fell through a floor and became stuck in a building, game not responding to input once or twice preventing progression but nothing major. A restart from last checkpoint fixed these first time.To be noted for western countries - Some players may be unhappy with the level of politics and wokeness of the title, it certainly can pull out of the escapism. The game has no police which is weird with the first games spidercop aspect, also not sure what would happen to the criminals left webbed to walls with no police. Lastly an entire mission (homecoming) is completely woke and I know some players will hate this, particularly those that are religious or conservative. It is a shame that a game which is intended to be an escape from reality drags you back to reality with these aspects.Positives - Good story, great escapism for the most part and it feels like being spiderman again.Overall 8 out of 10

Yeh you read that correctly, Legend of Zelda Links Awakening is a remake of a classic Gameboy game that was released 26 years ago.I am still mind blown by this game by how creative and quality the game is.The story in itself is completely nuts and course the game puts you in the boots of the legendary link.I won't go in to many more details asa I will leave that up to you because if your in to a game where you love uncovering secrets and unlocking tools to progress in a video game then I have to say this is one of the best in the bunch. Yet this was created how long ago?Honestly on top of this I have seen alot of complaints about how long the game is but I garentee you most of the player base complaining have been using guides, PLEASE DO NOT USE A GUIDE, this game does not need a guide and more often then not the answers to the puzzles lay right Infront of you and when you figure them out it is so so satisfying.On top of that there is a HARD MODE, where the game doesn't give you heart drops and much stronger enemies... Yeh try getting through that one. Plus I feel the world is so creative and full of mysteries to uncover you will enjoy a second play through to really absorb everything that goes on in such a beautiful crafted game.Trust me if you haven't purchased this yet and love a great adventure then this is for you I believe it's worth the price 100% I have no regrets and only joy being gripped to my seat for the last 4 days playing it none stop.The only issue with the game is drops in frame rate, is that a game breaker? Absolutely not.Quickly what are you waiting for??

I purchased this game not long after release and not long after purchasing my Switch Lite. I was instantly drawn when playing for the first time the polished feel of the game with it looking very nice on the Lite.At the beginning I struggled to get to grips with the game and constantly died on some of the Dungeons which made me play it even more. Soon progressing very quickly I found the tools in the late game easily solved my early game problems of launching myself into a chasm and losing hearts often making trips and cutting grass to get more hearts.The game in all looks fantastic, the storyline is easy to keep up with and is interesting. Even though I am not a Zelda Fanboy I found this game one of the most enjoyable that I have played so far and definitely had the Nintendo finish to it.

Exactly what I was hoping for and so much more.  I never played the original, but I can see why it's received so much love over the years.  This was a beautiful game that was so tightly packed.  It was almost the opposite of the Breath of the Wild, but in a fantastic way.  I probably finished it in about 12 hours, which is perfect for someone who has very very limited time.  But all four of my children are also loving this (ages 13, 11, 9 and 6).  Everything is interconnected in such an amazing way.  The entire overworld is a dungeon of sorts, locked out by each new item that you discover.The art style is perfect.Some reviewers have commented on frame rate.  I'm not sure how you'd notice, it's such a slow game.  There are bizarrely long loading times, and clicking through the text takes longer than expected.  Definitely a win.

Also like the fact that the game is fairly easy, so can keep playing without too much difficulty. Lots to explore on Koholint Island, and the dungeons provide some puzzling aspects to think about. Boss fights are fun as well. Furthermore, it was very interesting to see how this compares with the original GameBoy version- can really see how far games have evolved over the past 3 decades!

            Corona, a beer from lands afar,With a lime wedge, you're a shining star.Golden liquid, in a bottle clear,A taste of Mexico, we hold dear.On sunny days and warm, cool nights,You bring us joy, pure delight.A hint of citrus in each sip,With friends around, it's quite a trip.Your name, now linked to a global scare,But in a glass, we find no despair.Corona, a brew, a taste so fine,In these moments, you truly shine.

Subscribe & Save beers, what's not to like?
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 August 2023Size Name: 330.00 ml (Pack of 24)Style Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I have these on Subscribe & Save, they are already decent value especially with included delivery, but with the extra 15% these can work out to be 66p per bottle.  They've gone up a little lately but still better value than any of the supermarket offers.  Long dates on them too so even if they have to sit ready for the next bbq it won't be a problem.Great on a hot day (with or without a slice of lime!).

If you want a cheap beer delivered to your home buy this. It's Corona, what's to say.Only draw back is packaging. You need to dispose of a cardboard box, wrapping paper and the Corona packaging itself.

- Mounting.Super easy to mount with the provided template! Don't worry if at a later date you decide you need to use the provided wedge to give you that needed tilt the holes are extraly the same as the fixing plate and once locked into place it's super secure!- Setup.The Google home app literally talks you through everything and is super easy to follow! All you need is the home app and scan the QR code on the back of the camera and done! Grate field of view and very good quality which I was a little sceptical about as the specs where not brilliant but it's as good as my 5MP CCTV system!- App settings.Plenty of separate settings you can adjust such as for better battery life or better quality, linger recording ect, even chimes with existing Google speakers!- AdditionalYou can wire to the mains the cables are provided but unfortunately our house has never had a doorbell so we don't have this option but after researching this device for a while even at maximum use it'd last us a month on a full charge and that's with alot of use that's more than we'd probably use but where more than happy with that as it charges relatively quickly.-phone supportWithin a few seconds of the button being clicked all the speakers are ringing to a chime you choose (p.s they have event ones like Halloween) the notification is on your phone with live video footage straight from your notifications! (Android device here)Would I recommend? Yes for a Google eco system and android phones. (Unsure on iOS)Would I recommend for Alexa? Probably not as ring will be alot more optimised for the device.- Draw backs?It is expensive, so I'd suggest waiting for the sales! Then it's a bargain!

Overall great! Only one consideration about event storage
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2024Style Name: Video DoorbellPattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
Looks great, convenient and easy install. However you might want to consider these things before buying.Limited event storage after nest aware trail ends, events are only kept for 3 hours before being auto deleted. Which might defeat the whole purpose of monitoring your home. I am sure google can easily do 12-24 hours at least but it's their way if pushing Aware subscriptions. So you can either sub to Nest Aware or make sure you download event videos within 3 hours of getting the notification to review them later.Despite this concern, I find value in the device as a seamless addition to my Google Home setup. While it comes at a higher cost compared to other options, the two-way communication, mini live view, and night vision features are appreciated. I recommend the Nest Doorbell for those aiming for Google Home integration without the need for destructive installation.

Works well
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 July 2023Style Name: Video DoorbellPattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I’ve deleted my negative review as I was mistaken about how the product works. I previously complained that I was unable to access live view. After some experimentation and having lived with the doorbell for a few days, it is working normally. My issue was that I was trying to live view too often in too short a time span, having only just installed it and wanting to test it extensively, and the doorbell was conserving battery. Under normal usage, the live feed is accessible on demand. All other functions seem quick and reliable so far - there’s minimal delay between pressing the button and the Nest mini announcing a visitor. Notifications on my phone and watch are even quicker. The zoning feature is powerful and reliable. Person and parcel detection work well.I am impressed with the speed at which this doorbell operates. When someone presses the button, I can access the live feed very quickly. I previously had the old Nest Hello which was very slow and I’d often find that visitors had given up and left by the time I was into the feed.I will be hardwiring the doorbell. I need a new transformer as unfortunately the combined transformer/chime that I have is only 6V and doesn’t operate at all with this doorbell. Also unfortunately, Google doesn’t sell a solution to this, so I will be using a standard transformer from Toolstation or Screwfix and will use the Ring transformer enclosure in place of my current chime, and will continue to use a the Nest mini as my chime.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2015Verified Purchase
I purchased this as a reward incentive for a school teacher who uses it to encourage her primary school children to do daily tasks. They get to put a piece on the toy until the whole character is complete and then she rewards them with a small sweet. I think you could do the same to control carb intake and remove a piece each day until he is featureless!As a toy it has limited attention grabbing appeal but depending on the age it can be used to encourage hand coordination and children get a great satisfaction over putting the pieces in the right place.It's a very robust construction and I'm sure it has a good life span just so long as the pieces are kept safe.There are quite a few versions of this toy available so check out the different possibilities first. This one doesn't come with many pieces but the price is good and extra pieces are available.

Best hair product I have ever used!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2021Verified Purchase
I never write reviews usually, but just have to on this occasion.  I bought Revlon Unique One to try after my hairdresser recommended it. I have very fine hair that is prone to being flyaway, and I have a slight natural wave so it is difficult to get that nice, smooth, sleek blow dry look on my bob length hair. It is a constant battle to get my hair looking nice at home. Slightest bit of damp weather or moisture will mean my hair will curl and wave and look fluffy. Usually hair care products don't live up to expectations and things like this normally weigh my fine hair down making it look lank and greasy.  Let me just say that this stuff is truly amazing. It has got to be the best hair product I have ever used. My hair blow dry's beautifully and is smooth, incredibly shiny and straight. It is effortless to achieve that nice straight, sleek bob. It tames fluffy stuff and eliminates flyaway hair. My hair stays in shape much better after a night's sleep. Because I have that natural wave, even if I run my GHD'S through it, usually the next day when I wake up I will have wavy and crazy sticky out hair that won't straighten no matter what so I have to wash it again if I want the smooth sleek bob look. Since using Unique One I do find the day after I have washed my hair it retains that nice, smooth, sleek bob shape much better and for longer. I have to perhaps iron out the odd kink here and there but generally my hair it retains it's style much better than it would if I didn't use this product. Hands down the best hair care product ever for me. I would give it more stars if I could. As for reviews that mention horrid smell, they must be using a different product or a fake product as I find this pleasant enough. Just buy this, you won't regret it. It's multi purpose as it provides heat styling protection too so is really useful. If like me you have fine, hard to style, unruly fluffy hair, or even thick unruly hair, try it. You will be so thankful you did. It's worth every single penny.

5 second rule - Fast paced, entertaining and funny! Easy to understand and play recommend for adults and children.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 April 2013Verified Purchase
One of the most funny and entertaining games around - don't take yourself too seriously.How the game is played:Its for 3 - 6 players *but you can add counters which we did for extra players and just got some paper to draw up a few extra cards for the extra players.Every man for themselves in this game!Each player has 5 seconds to answer a question for example 'name 3 yellow foods'. All questions ask you for 3 answers within 5 seconds and the 3rd answer is where you usually have trouble when the pressure is on! And it is amazing what you say under pressure!Its a fast paced game so make sure you are listening because if any of the answers are wrong, the time immediately starts with the next player who CAN NOT use any of the correct answers already given and if they can't give 3 correct answers it immediately goes on to the next player - and so on until back to the original player.There are both easy and hard questions and it has a very decent amount of questions to ask. We played 7 players and played it twice without using the same cards.Each player has two cards which allows them another question if they can't do the answer and two cards to throw the question to the next opponent in an instant!This adds to the fun.There are NO ANSWERS on the cards so you can't cheat so what we did find useful its to be able to use your phone to check the odd answer was correct or not and sometimes you have to vote if the answers are acceptable or not? But again this add's to the fun.Questions are quite diverse.Only down side i can find is there doesn't seem to be any other cards you can buy for the questions. Other than that this game is great!

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2011Verified Purchase
Going along with the others here.What you get: A small folding board 25 x 25cm folded and 25 x 50cm open. 6 coloured marker pieces. 12 'Switch' cards. 12 'Pass' cards and two sets of double sided question cards. Plastic tubular stand up 5 second timer. Instructions.The game: Simply move 12 spaces from start to finish. You move if you can simply call out 3 somethings in 5 seconds. Each player takes it in turn to be asked a question. If they succeed, the next player answers the next question. If you fail, the next player gets to try and steal your move by calling out 3 in 5, (although they can't use anything already mentioned). This is the UK version so yes, even Corrie is included i.e. Name 3 Corrie characters......What's that? You've done it already? Ah well, that may be, but when those mini ball bearings are shooting down the helter skelter tube and the pressure is on, even naming three things beginning with the letter 'R' can be tricky.We played this for the first time on Christmas evening and were laughing as much at some very weird answers that came out as much as the inability of several family members to complete even the simplest question. Trust me, when you ask , 'Name 3 famous blonde female film stars and someone calls out Mahatma Ghandi, you know they've one, had too much sherry, or two, the pressure has got to them.There are two danger zones where if you fail at any stage to answer 3 in 5 you miss the next go.This is addictive, we even started just asking questions as a spot-quiz throughout the day. I can definitely also see this used in the summer as a BBQ or Beer Garden drinking game.Yes it can be over within twenty minutes, but you simply call that round one and do a best of challenge.You should be aware, this is a noisy game, as we found out after finally getting Jr to bed, we woke him twenty minutes later despite being at the other end of the house. When the pressure is on, you can wave any calmness goodbye.

There are 2 danger zones which when you land on these you have to answer three questions correctly to move on which is harder than it sounds!You have 5 seconds to answer your question which is timed with a helter skelter type timer which is really easy for kids to use. An example of some of the questions is: name three things you might drink out of or name three words that rhyme with last etc which sound dead easy but when youre put on the spot everything goes out of your mind and you just can't think of anything.Our family had a good laugh with players from 8 years to 81 years all getting involved and thoroughly enjoying it!

Great game, Great concept and can yield hilarious answers.  A lot of fun.  However I made the mistake of buying the classic version instead of junior and many of the questions are ones kids can’t answer.  My mistake, I didn’t realise there were two versions otherwise I would’ve bought the junior.  Just something to be aware of.  We still play, I just skip cards if I know the question is something they won’t have a hope in hell of even being able to guess at.

Better Than Actifry
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2020Verified Purchase
We had a Tefal Actifry but after a couple of years that completely gave up the ghost. The reason why we bought an Actifry was due to the paddle, but we always felt there was something ""off"" about it. It didn't feel very well built, the paddle broke after about a year and the fit between the lid and body was poor, so a lot of hot air escaped. It was also quite noisy.After a couple of years of light/moderate use the heater element completely burned out so we got rid and decided to go for a non-paddle air fryer.Having seen the reviews of Tefal's - again a lot of citing poor build quality, we looked for another brand and happened across the Ninja air fryer. Persuaded by the very favourable reviews we decided to get one. A wise choice!Now obviously the major difference between the Actifry and the Ninja is that the Ninja doesn't have a paddle, which means that food needs to be shaken to ensure even cooking - no big deal.First impressions when we received it was that the build quality in comparison to the Actifry is night and day. The Ninja feels so much more solid. The pan and crisper plate are ceramic coated rather than Teflon, which also lends itself to a higher quality feel. The machine itself is much quieter in operation and the temperature controls are also very welcome - something that was very much missing from our Actifry. Also very welcome are the 4 cooking options - air fry, roast, dehydrate and reheat. So far we've only used the air fry function but we'll definitely be trying the others at some point.Cooking results so far have been excellent - we have cooked frozen chips, baby potatoes and fresh cut chips (yes we like our potatoes). What amazes me is the speed at which this thing cooks. With the Actifry it would take around 40 minutes to cook fresh cut chips, and even then they may need a little longer. With the Ninja we found that fresh cut chips took around 25 minutes - or 30 minutes if we wanted them extra crisp. It is far quieter than the Actifry and clean up is also much easier, as there are less items to clean - only the pan and crisper plate in comparison to the Actifry's lid, fan filter, pan and paddle.I'm looking forward to trying different foods in this that wouldn't have been possible in the Actifry, such as baked potatoes, roasted veg, and for drying out fruit using the dehydrate function.As you can tell, I am very impressed and given the higher build quality I am expecting to get many years' use out of it. At first glance it may seem a bit more limited in use than the Actifry due to the lack of paddle, but in actuality this makes it more versatile as you can use it to cook more delicate foods that would otherwise have been broken up by the paddle.Highly recommended!

Time & Money Saving
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 September 2023Verified Purchase
I liked almost everything, I tried these products when they first appeared and ended up selling it, it was smaller but inconsistent and more trouble than what it benefitted.This however I found in John Lewis along with a coffee machine. I spoke to the usual very informed and truthful sales assistant and assessed the size, convenience and price, it was on offer and so decided to buy, however no stock due to its popularity in reduction price, usage and savings in time and money, it’s fantastic I bought two collapsable  silicon inners that save on washing up although you can put the food holder in dishwasher, the inners are great, safe and easy to store as you can have one always ready to go in machine, pre heat 2/3 mins take potatoes, squash, carrots, parsnips, and slice, chip, cube etc and addd seasoning of choice, even oil if required, same for meat chicken, lamb, pork etc and I usually microwave the afore mipentioned veg to just get them started, as apposed to boiling, in container, lid on drop of water 3 tea spoons max, and three mins on 1000 or adjust accordingly, then into dryfry and 180 to 190 5 to 7mins and then check adjust and same again, fish, salad, meat, pasta being prepared as this cooks and your done corn on cob, let your mind go wild or look up some recipes, but no heating the fan oven to then wait 30 mins or more and apart from Pizza I haven’t used oven since three months, that's just the tip, I can see Christmas beeping lots more fun, and flexible. Also much cheaper and healthier, less washing up. It’s a win win like microwave if you use correctly and remember they have moved on in the past thirty years, my new Panasonic MW has no turntable and so much larger capacity, I had to replace my 15 year old Panasonic as it started making a funny noise? Now I can literally get a chicken portion out of freezer and within 30 mins be sat down eating a lovely succulent meal with veg or accompanied veg, baked potato, or whatever and only a plate and inner silicone container and bowl to wash. I’m sat here now with nothing out of freezer and could be eating a lovely meal in 30 mins, instead I’m going to do a risotto as I got a homemade stock out of freezer yesterday and that’s in fridge, so it’s not that I can’t cook or that I don’t like good food, I do and I’m just pointing out those things like, having to go into town (this is like you have to eat) but you don’t have a car, so it’s plan to get to bus outperform train station etc, or cut a piece of wood, but you don’t have a saw, so what I’m saying is this and the other things I’ve mentioned just give you mother options and make it Quicker whilst saving money in the long run.

Convenient, clean, healthy and economical.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2023Verified Purchase
Bought for convenience and to replace a chip pan. The single/double portion size is sufficient for us and doesn’t use too much counter space. As with a microwave, I wouldn’t expect to cook a roast lunch in it.I bought the Ninja because of its reputation for quality.Ideal for giving our grandson after school chicken/ fish and chips with separately cooked vegetables.“Air fryer” is a misnomer; it’s a miniature forced air oven. Two table spoonfuls of oil are needed to achieve golden coloured chips. The big advantage is that the appliance is quick and easy to clean and any oil used is fresh each time.Most recipes benefit from removing the cooking tray and shaking it every 5 to 10 minutes. Cooking resumes seamlessly when the tray is reinserted.Published recipes vary greatly so it’s a question of checking progress regularly and finding out what temperature and time settings work best. It’s less programmable than most microwaves and multi-cookers.It is not a complete replacement for an oven and hob, and time saving is marginal in some cases, but relatively it is convenient, clean, healthy and economical.

I bought this and warned my son that it might be a bit painful. On the first attempt, he didn’t let me apply it for more than 15 seconds, but the verruca remained and after 2 weeks we re-attempted it. This time I got my son to hold my phone with the timer and he was aware that he needed to withstand the pain for longer for it to work. After 30 seconds the verruca went completely white and within a few weeks it peeled of completely like a scab. My son is so happy to have his toe back to normal and is really glad that I bought it.

Dirty, Dusty, Broken Controller, rated very good?
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2019Verified Purchase
The controller didn't work, luckily I had one from a previous console. The console was dirty and had dust within the device. This is  disappointing and misleading considering the quality was classed as ""very good"". I was expecting better. Little care was taken in the product, someone who cares about doing a good job would test everything before allowing it to be sent to a buyer and would take the time to clean the product. Packaging was rushed and undesirable, when I collected the package it was wrapped in a bin bag and looked suspicious. If it ticked i'd probably think its a bomb :). The PS2 works but I'm disappointed with the quality and care taken.

Console ok but controller didn't work.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 March 2019Verified Purchase
First of all, for the money it's a real bargain. The PS2 is a few years old now but the games for it are still playable and I decided to purchase one. It arrived promptly and well packed. The machine was somewhat dusty as if it had just come off someone's shelf but that is expected. The console itself works fine but the controller did not and I had to buy a new one. Perhaps this should be checked as well. I've looked through other people's reviews to find this has happened before. For this reason I've given four stars.

The Playstation 2 arrived very quickly (one to 4 days earlier than the estimated delivery date) and was packed really well. Talking about at least 30 yards of bubblewrap here - as someone suffering from anxiety I appreciate this free stress relief very much.I was supplied with a console, scart cable, a power cable, an original Playstation 2 controller and even a memory card. All of these, including the console itself, are in perfect working order and surprisingly clean. I found minimal loose dust in the fan and expansion slot, but that's to be expected and was easily cleaned.There's not much else that needs saying. If it wasn't for a minimal scratch on the front of the console you'd swear it was brand new. I'm absolutely happy with my purchase and would absolutely recommend this seller.

Utterly addictive, long playing life
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 December 2009Verified Purchase
This is exactly the game you'd expect if you've ever played one of the Mario Bros. platform titles before - it's the same scrolling from right to left concept with the same characters, the same format of worlds and Bowser confrontations at the end of each one.The important difference is that up to four people can play it at the same time - this turns it from a rather solitary and unsociable pursuit into many evenings of fun.The levels themselves are very difficult - some of the bonuses are only achievable with more than one player playing unless you are very skilled with the controller, especially the time-based collection tasks - which lead me to conclude that this was designed as a multi- rather than a single-player game.It manages to keep both types of player happy though - both dedicated ones and casual. At first there's 8 worlds to explore, but if you manage to get all the large coins then a 9th opens up for you to try (but you ned to get ALL the big coins in all other 8 worlds to progress to different stages in the final world). This adds a real longevity to the game because once you have it mastered, there's an addd incentive to get all the coins.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to play a fun game with children who have a basic level of proficiency to their gameplaying skills; it would make a great gift too.Edit: it tok me a week before I realised that if I held the 1 button down while moving, my character would sprint - and therefore jump a little further too (I wish I had known that earlier), and that if I pressed the 'a' button at times of extreme danger I would go back into my bubble and be safe (another thing I wish I knew earlier).Edit 12March 2010 - my partner and I are still playing this game, having fun looking up the location of the secret coins on youtube! A great game.

Could be better
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2010Verified Purchase
I bought 'Super Mario' because I used to play it as a child and I absolutely loved it back then. It's generally good, nice graphics, good challenges, but there are aspects of the game that really irritate me such as: the fact that you can't save each game before going to the next one, which means that if you die on the last game of the group, you have to go back and do all the games in that group again, which can get really repetitive if you keep dying on that last game. Also, most games just remove a life from your character when they die, but in this one not only you lose a life, but you're also placed in a bubble and you need to be rescued by another member of the team, which I think is a useless and time consuming addition to the game.

Mario returns to his roots in this most brilliant 2d platformer in which 4 people can all play together as a team!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 November 2009Verified Purchase
Super Mario Bros on the NES was the first Nintendo game I played many years ago and it was a top class platformer and still is to this day. I have been playing New Super Mario Bros. Wii  with my partner and it is harder then the DS Mario game which I prefer but she doesn't. We are having a great laugh playing as a team and we sometimes kill eachother by mistake. Nintendo have taken the best parts from Super Bros 3 on the NES and the best parts from Super Mario World on the SNES and have overall made the best 2d Mario platformer of all time with it's insane four player mode which is fantastic fun. The graphics look wonderful and just for me and maybe other long term Nintendo fans this game is more fun then Mario Galaxy. You get to play as Mario, Luigi, Blue Toad or Yellow Toad and best of all are friend Yoshi is back to ride on and help us out. Mario has some great new power-ups such as the Propller Mushroom which is great for reaching hidden areas high up in the air. The Ice Flower lets our hero chuck ice balls that feeze ememies and was used in Mario Galaxy but is the first time for a 2d Mario platformer. The Penguin Suit is great for when you are swimming and also allows you to throw ice balls. For me this is the best Nintendo game on the Wii this year and everybody who has a Wii should buy this game right now because it really is Nintendo at their best!

Great game, made me hurt myself.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2010Verified Purchase
This game has very good multiplayer. It also destroys friendships. I started playing the game alone and left the first world with 20 lives gathered. My friend then visited and by the time we had reached world three, I had lost all my lives and had had to continue 4 times. It is amazingly fun, addictive, funny, surreal and pretty, as well as nostalgic. My friend and I had to stop playing because I was becoming ratty and was hitting him every time he bounced off my head, sending me to my death.In single player, it is just as fun, but because one feels that there are no obstacles (or friends as I used to call them) to perfection, I continually restarted games should I miss a coin or a secret passage or even if I lost a life. This made progress hard, and it took me about 7 hours to reach world 4. At this point I saw mario every time I shut my eyes, so I took a razor, heated it in a candle flame to sterilise it, and carved the world map from the original Super Mario Brothers onto my forearm.

Right, so we can all upgrade our ever changing gadgets with all the latest consoles and TV's bigger than our dinner tables but thankfully Mario never changes. A classic, brilliant and fantastic game, with all the nostalgia of the old game boy game and a few sneaky extras, you'll be far from dissapointed. Admittedly they have made it a bit harder and it gets frustrating when you have to restart the same level 18 times before moving on, but it's still addictive, and still great!Controls are normally a massive thing for me when playing a game and quite ironically I hate the Wii games where it's all based on the exact movement of the controller etc, but this game is not like that at all. You tilt the wii remote to its side and use the up,down,left, right and 2 button, just like gameboy controls.It's nice to see they still actually make games like this still, It's nice to have a change from all the hi-def racers and shooters once in a while!

Absolute Garbage!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 July 2017Verified Purchase
The worst toy ever created.The first couple of hours is fun and all, but then you realise that it can't do anything else then laugh, constantly talk,  farting and burping.A piece of rock is a better toy then this. At least that listens to you without constantly talking.Just a couple of things:Rude little furry bastard. Not teaching one useful thing to your kids except that farting and barfing is awesome.Can't shut the hell up.Want's you to connect it all the time, but of course it loses connection and needs reset all the time.No volume control, so it's loud as hell.Eats batteries as it were candy. Even 2100mAh rechargeable ones can't last a day.You have to unscrew and screw the damn thing to change batteries or to reset it when it doesn't connect.The connect app is unintuitive, useless and meaningless as this toy itself.Save yourself the trouble and buy Lego or something. (a rock maybe).My girls stopped playing with it, after the second day.If you really want one, buy it when it's on a huge discount. Like £10 or less.

One of the best interactive toys
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 December 2017Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
One of the most interactive toys you can buy, this is great fun for little kids. I was surprised by how well the app and software was set up, the Furby really did interactive ''realistically' to what was on screen. Of course it eats through batteries pretty quick so get some good quality rechargeables. The kids play with this for about 30 mins at a time so it's not going to keep them amused for hours. With little ones 3-7 you will need to sit with them and show them (i.e. work) the app which is fine. Build quality is very good with no loose fur and good stitching/glue.

Great for training accuracy, but item moves when hit hard
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 July 2021Verified Purchase
The body oponent bag (or BOB) by Century has been around for a while.  Assembly was straight forward although it was a little difficult to fit the mannequin onto the stand, the fit is quite tight and finding the allignment for the two screws was a little tricky. Once fitted however it's all very sturdy.  I filled the base up with water.  This also means all the weight is at the bottom, which is unlike a real oponent. Height adjustment is good . I am 6ft2"" and I could set the BOB at the same height. There are fairly large steps between height settings however so you might find that you can't quite get the 'perfect' height for you, but then again, no opponent will be 'perfect' either.  Hitting the BOB feels good, it's features help you develop accurate aim and techniques such as uppercuts can be trained well on this unlike a heavy bag, which doesn't have the right shape for this. Not having much weight at the top means there isn't much resistance when striking so don't expect to develop hard hits with this.  Secondly, the Bob has a tendency to move a bit when hitting hard, and while you could use footwork and move to another side to hit it back to where it came from, this isn't practical for most people, but it is not exclusive to this BOB, it happens to allmost all freestanding bags.  So in short, the BOB is a great item to train solo and work on accuracy, technique development, but it's too light to receive kicks or hard punches.  For that, a heavy bag that is properly hung up from the ceiling for example, is a better option.  Get a BOB to develop your accuracy/precision in your hand strikes/punches, and use it NEXT to a heavy bag for power development/endurance and kicks.

Solid pun bag
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 May 2023Verified Purchase
Really solid punch bag with adjustable height.  The rubber is very nice to hit, not too hard but solid.I was a bit worried buying this as I am in a 1st floor flat with wood flooring so I was worried about the noise.  This is a justified concern. I put in 150kg of sand and some water but it still moved around and banged the floor.Here's my advice if you buy:It's a 2 man job so have someone ready to help.Sand is preferable for filling the base and 150-200kg is needed if you hit hard.If you have wooden flooring, buy a thick exercise mat, put the base on top, then fill up afterwards.You can add water to create more space for filling upIt is going to be very heavy to move, so once you've filled it, that's where it'll be.

Came over a week early and is an amazing punching dummy. I upgraded from a solid punching man to the century Bob and was 100% worth the money, it’s tough enough to take a beating but is soft enough to be used without gloves. The base is a lot better than I thought from reading some other reviews about it being unstable but i have filled it with sand and I wouldn’t expect it to be any more sturdy considering it has easy height adjustment and the dummy part can be removed off. I am very happy with my purchase.

Impressive, versatile machine
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 March 2024Style Name: CREAMi DeluxePattern Name: SingleVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )Verified Purchase
This is something a bit special! Mind you, that’s perhaps to be expected from Ninja. First things first, though – it is NOT a traditional ice cream maker. It doesn’t freeze anything. But it does turn frozen mixes into ice cream, while being versatile enough to create slushis and a whole range of other chilled/frozen drinks and desserts.You create a mixture, freeze it for 24 hours in one of the three included tubs, then process it in the machine. It basically grinds down the frozen mix and optionally stirs in additions (“mix-ins”) such as nuts, fruit or chocolate chips.It’s very noisy but only takes a minute or two to produce the desired product. Results are likely to be mixed, on initial use, or at least were for us. You have to experiment and find what works for you (which is part of the fun). And you do need spare freezer space. Ideally, you’d have three tubs in there with different contents, then choose which one to process.I doubt if the machine saves much money, if any, over shop-bought, quality ice cream. But it lets you choose the ingredients, reducing sugar and avoiding the nasties that might be lurking in commercial products. And, of course, you can make all sorts of flavours and mixes that you can’t buy.I’ve investigated the many recipe books that are available for the machine. They all seem to be American at present, unfortunately. That means ingredients that have different names and need translation, ingredients that are hard to find in the UK, US imperial measures such as cups instead of metric, and some super-unhealthy all-American recipes. Still, there’s a good selection of recipes in the booklet that comes with the machine, even if they’ve been converted directly from US versions, resulting in some strange quantities such as 112g sugar.Bottom line, though – we’re having great fun with this. If you only really want to make ice cream, choose an ice cream maker that churns and freezes. If, however, you value the Ninja’s versatility and want to make a variety of drinks and desserts, don’t hesitate to buy.

If you've been debating one, you've already watched YT videos saying that the rod inside the machine can be difficult to clean. If you just keep wiping down the metal part that attaches to the blade (you'll see it clearly) and submerging the lid and blade in warm soapy water, you'll be fine. That is the only drawback to this machine, and why I left 4 stars for that part.IT IS WONDERFUL! And easy to use! And makes AMAZING ice cream!

Once you get used to planning 24 hours ahead, you'll never buy ice cream again. Just put the mixed ingredients for your chosen flavour ( of which there are many and varied recipes available online) into one of the supplied tubs and freeze overnight. Pop it into the Ninja 'Creami' (personally, the name gives me the 'ick') and after a few minutes of technical wizardry, you have ice cream or sorbet which rivals any store bought variety and you are safe in the knowledge that you are fully aware what ingredients went into it. Sure, it's a little noisy when it's doing its thing but, it's so worth it. A solid five star review from a diabetic who can now make, and more importantly, EAT, genuinely sugar free desserts. 😋

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2023Style Name: CREAMiPattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I waited a year to write a review.  I use this all the time.  Took a little while to get used to it but now its second nature. My kids have a food intolerance to tannins that mean that pretty much all commercially produced ice cream is no good for them so this is a God send.  I find if I follow the recipes exactly then the recipes come out perfect every time.  Ive made perfect ice cream, gelato and sorbets, as nice as a gelataria.  the sorbets have a similar consistency to ice cream, i love them.  The milkshake recipes come out thick and ice-creamy like what you would get in a restuarant.  Only thing I found disappointing is that I had hoped to make low sugar recipes but the sugar is an important component as it is an anti-freeze.  But I've embraced it because the ice cream is so rich and decadent that you only need a small portion to be satisfied.  There is a large Ninja community on Facebook where people have successfully made recipes using various sweeteners, I havent tried it personally but its there as an option.  Some of the Ninja sorbet recipes sich as the watermelon dont have much added sugar anyway.

This game is great fun.  You basically have to perform lots of different tasks using the equipment in the box.We are a family of 4, including a 9 and 11 Yr old and have spent many an evening playing this. There are so many different tasks to play, and the kids have just as much chance as the adults to win. Such a great idea and so different from any other game that we’ve ever played.

This is a fun game with lots of little silly challenges to compete. It can be very funny watching some people struggle to complete a challenge. Watching people attempt to throw ping pong balls and other items in particular ways can be hilarious sometimes. My mum laughed so much playing this game. Seeing her laugh like that was priceless.I also like that often you’re playing against or with another. It gets people interacting and laughing.  Easy to learn and fun to play.

At 40 I still get those hormonal spots I did when I was a teen. I tend to pick my skin because I like seeing it clean and feeling it smooth, so these dots come great. Just when finishing my skin routine in the evening I get a sense of whether I need any, and if so then I do place them where needed until the next morning. They really absorb as much as possible and don't leave my skin drier nor patchy. As a very nice bonus, they're not visible when you're having Teams meetings all day long. My skin has improved because of them, even if just by not being able to pick my skin in the meantime!Never have had acne though so I can't comment on effectiveness for that use case – but of course, dots are not going to solve acne by themselves. It's an aid, not a silver bullet! 😀

Had a couple of stubborn spots that wouldn't go. Put the dots on and left them in place for about 24 hours. They are clear until they go a bit white after almost 24 hours in this case. When removed, the spots had gone down and were practically flat to the skin.  Since then, one has completely disappeared and the other has left only a low and soft patch which isn't noticeable. Had another spot came up, put on a dot and when removed the spot had gone so hadn't had a chance to become a stubborn one as otherwise often happens. Was sceptical but these really do work.

THE BEST
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2024Size Name: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Colour Name: Original Dot - RoundVerified Purchase
Hands down the best spot patches EVER. Worth every penny.Depending on the area you place them they made my spots appear less red and it was barely noticeable there was a spot patch on.Ive even forgot where I had one and not noticed it all day. I have done this more times than i care to admit and they have even survived a shower and not come off! Be careful around the hair line cause they really do stick and its not fun to take off.As for results. My best spots are gone in a few days, if that. When you take them off you can quite literally see where all the ""bad"" has been drawn out, especially when i put them on after i have popped a spot. Not sure if youre meant to but i do with no issues. Only down side is they dont go under make up well as makeup amplifies the edges of the stickers visibility which without it is minimal.I do recommend using toner/washing your face after peeling off as it leaves a residue and when i was in a rush and did my normal makeup routine you could see where I had the patch. So dont forget this step.But I have used others and they just cover it so they dont get irritated/dirty. These you literally see the benefits.My skin looks amazing. You wont regret the purchase.

Sort of works - but do NOT leave on when showering or bathing!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 April 2024Size Name: 24 count (Pack of 1)Colour Name: Original Dot - RoundVerified Purchase
I honestly feel like these only help in that you don't touch or getting anything on your spot whilst they're on. They stick too hard, and when you pull them off they can break the skin and pop the spot. It kind of hurts to be honest. I also accidentally left them on when I went for a bath, and they basically melted onto my face. The bath wasn't even that hot, and I didn't go under the water, so apparently very little steam can make them melt, it was horrible to get off. I've used another brand that stays on, but doesn't stick so hard, and is thicker so never had them melt, so will probably go back to them.

I have bought a fair few brands of spot patches in my time and these are perform the best and are great value. They are nice and thin and don't budge when they are on. I use them on dry clean skin otherwise they don't stick even if you remove your skincare on and around the spot. My other half also uses them and they work really well. They can leave a bit of residue if left on overnight or all day but this comes off easily. They reduce the redness of the angriest spots as soon as you put them on. I also use them even if the spot isn't squeezable as I am bad for touching my face throughout the day which causes the spot to get worse. Buying another pack today.

From a parents perspective...amazing little console
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2020Platform For Display: TurquoiseEdition: ConsoleVerified Purchase
Bought as a present for my daughter so it's more of a review of the console as a parent.Perfect console for kids. It has a good collection of AAA and indie kid friendly games.The menu is really easy to navigate for children.You can put parental locks so to speak so children cant play certain games. Also you can put a timer on the switch lite itself  so you only allow an x amount of time for the child to be on it in a day. You can customise this so they can play longer on weekends for example.The portability is fantastic, easy to use and reach each button without and restrain on your hands (so far atleast).Although I believe the battery life is not bad, it would have been nice just for it to last for an extra hour or so, however again, this is for my daughter who is only allowed on it for so long in a day so it's not a problem really.The only con I really have with it is that there are no apps like netflix, like previous generations, however this is a portable gaming console so it's not much of a con just something to bare in mind.Honestly though if you are a parent and thinking of getting a switch lite for your child, I would definitely recommend. It is all you need and the restrictions you can set are easy to use.

The GameBoy of the 2020s - shame no Dockmode solution
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 November 2019Platform For Display: TurquoiseEdition: ConsoleVerified Purchase
I’ve had the original Switch since day one. I’ve loved the platform for many many reasons, mainly because Nintendo seem to just be on the ball again with that old school magic. So many awesome games.Why did I buy the lite when I have the original? Well, 90% of the time I would play mine in handheld mode. I don’t have kids yet and only used Dock mode when playing Mario Kart with the wife or friends. Other than that, it’s train commute, flights and chilling on the sofa being lazy. The Lite is the perfect handheld mode Switch, I prefer the design, the feel and the screen. The library of games as well is excellent and I really feel like I have the first truly modern Game Boy replacement with a great selection of classic games, new indie games and AAA Nintendo originals like Breathe of the Wild.I love playing family friendly games like Mario Kart or Monkey ball with the original in Dock mode. Then using the Lite as MY OWN dedicated space to focus on completing adventure like Links Awakening or Celeste, in my personal mind space. It stays in my bag and goes everywhere I go.I’m removing one star from an otherwise glowing review because I think it’s a mistake to not have any TV out functionality. I understand it’s handheld only and out of the box, I don’t think it should have it. But, there should be the option to. The original Switches modular approach to every use case was perfect. £280 for a handheld and a dock when needed. The dock sells for £80-100 on its own, so in theory, if Nintendo did a normal switch without the dock, it should retail for £199. There is £50 android smartphones that have the capability to do HDMI out, so why has Nintendo removed this entirely from the Switch Lite? Have it as an optional extra. Not expecting it out of the box for £199, but let us buy a dock to turn it into the TV out mode, even if it’s a more expensive dock. Yes, I’ll have to buy a pro pad or Joycons (already have them), but give us that option. Yes, it was fine to reduce the cost but we didn’t get that saving passed onto us folks. By RRps, removing the HD Rumble, the Dock, the L and R Joycons was enough to reduce the RRP by £80. So, for this reason I am left disappointed with Nintendo’s decision. Will it sell like hot cakes? Absolutely? Am I a niche who feels this way? Very likely. But if you’re a family who want to buy this and then opt in the future for the Dock mode at a later date, you will have to buy a whole new console. Unless of course, Nintendo make a Dock mode only version that isn’t portable in anyway.

Good and reliable item , easy to install
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2023Colour Name: CharcoalConfiguration: Device OnlyVerified Purchase
Having been investing in Alexa Dots for some years saw this newer version on a prime deal so added it to my collection . I normally replace an old version and find somewhere new to place the older one. My house is now pretty much covered with Alexa Dots now.As always with Alexa products this unit is easy to setup and install straight out of the box. As a veteran Alexa user I already have the app set up and used the Amazon preconfigured option selected at checkout ..If you are new to Alexa you will have to download and setup the Alexa app, which is also intuitive and easy to set up.Now to the Dot itself , it looks identical to the 4th generation dot so be a little careful when buying one and make sure you buy the generation you want . There should be better pricing and deals on the 4th Gen but the reason I purchased this one is due to some additional tech inside the unit and supposedly better sound quality.The sound is very good, not HI-FI quality but more than good enough for day to day use . ( I have paired 2 x Dots together in my main room to utilise the stereo options on the device. Apparently the 5th gen has a larger speaker/woofer and after comparing the 4th and the 5th gen together I can confirm the sound quailty is slightly better with particularly a better bass ) the difference in quality is NOT a huge jump from the gen 4 but still noticeably better , and is massively better than the 3rd gen Dot.An issue I have with both the 5th and 4th Gen Alexa Dot is the light bar is on the bottom of the unit. I use the light bar quite a lot to see if Alexa is responding in a noisy Enviroment or for notifications and as with most of my dots I buy 3rd party wall mounts for them to keep the cables nice and tidy and off a flat surface.the problem with this as most of these mounts place the light ring at the back and therefore close to the wall and makes the light bar hard to view. ( it’s a minor niggle not a deal breaker )The additional tech that grabbed my attention was the inclusion of a temperature and motion sensor.Both these would be ideal to add to my smart Home system to enable routines for heating and lighting etc so was eager to test these out.The temperature sensor:This is a great addition works very well and responds quickly to voice commands. I tested the accuracy by putting another smart temp sensor in the same room with an additional stand alone temperature sensor.The accuracy of the Alexa sensor was accurate and comparable to the two other sensors tested in the same room .. it is so easy to add it to routines in the Alexa app and works well.The Motion Sensor:I was eager to try this out as well as I wanted to make use of it Alexa routines such as if someone walked in the room the lights switched on and if there was no motion for a set time the lights would switch off. This is a fairly simple routine in the smart home .Unfortunately the motion sensor in the Alexa Dot 5th gen is pretty much useless and simply doesn’t work. It uses a slightly different way by detecting motion using ultrasonic technology. I realise this technology wouldn’t be the best as any noise in the room, such as TV , people speaking etc would diminish the accuracy of the sensor .. however having tested it many times in a completely silent room it simply doesn’t work , and on the odd occasion it does actually work it’s usually from an unknown source and not actually from someone entering the room.Conclusion: if you want good Alexa integration , a more than adequate sound for every day use , and a temp sensor buy this with no qualms that you will be getting a good quality product that works well straight from the box.If you are buying this for the motion sensor tech , don’t bother it’s useless and you would be much better off buying a separate smart motion sensor . The Echo Dot version is unreliable and just going to give you many headaches

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 Two years have passed since I reviewed the Amazon Echo Dot Gen 4 and now we have the new Echo Dot Gen 5 so it’s time to revisit the world of Alexa.If you’re familiar with Echo and Alexa, you’ll only be interested in the first part of this review and you can ignore everything after my device appraisal. I’m sure, though, that many people may be new to smart speakers so I’ve also added sections on how to install the Alexa app, how to set up your new speaker and what you can subsequently do with the Echo Dot. My apologies for going over things that you might already know and a lot of this repeats from my previous review, but there will be for which this is new territory.The Device:The Echo speakers have been around for many years now, and despite the best efforts of Google and Apple, Amazon’s Alexa still remains the smart assistant of choice. The most popular of all smart speakers is the Echo Dot. Other bigger and better sounding speakers are available including Amazon’s own larger Echo, but the Echo Dot has always hit a nice sweet spot of performance and affordability. The first couple of generations of Echo Dots were clearly toes in the water to see if we were ready for smart assistants. They gave us a glimpse of what could be achievable, but they didn’t sound particularly good. We’ve still got a couple of Generation 2 Echo Dots that live in the garage and shed, and they really do sound tinny and weak. That changed with the Generation 3 Echo Dot, of which we have seven around the house, as they sounded so much better. The sound was deeper and the volume could go much higher before losing fidelity. The microphone was also improved, and the entire experience with using Alexa made a big step forward.Two years ago I bought an Echo Dot Generation 4 on release day, and shortly afterwards followed that up with the larger Echo. And today, the Generation 5 arrived. I’ve spent several hours since then playing with it, testing it out alongside my existing speakers and the very similar Generation 4.So, what’s different between the Gen 4 and 5? Well, visually, not very much. The only real difference I could spot was the loss of an auxiliary port from the rear of the new device. Beyond that, no difference at all. I read from the press releases that the 5 is sonically much improved over the 4, but in side-by-side testing I struggled to see much difference between the two. If anything, I felt that Alexa’s voice when she’s talking to you seems like she’s stood a little further away. But it still sounds great. Not just great for the money, but great in general.We have much bigger and better speakers in our house, but when listening to music we almost always play it through the Echo Dots. I’ve got a Bose speaker right next to the Dot in my office, but always use the Dot for music. I work from home and I’m in my office 9-16 hours per day, and the Echo Dot is on for most of that time. If you want the absolute best sound, you’re likely to want to spend much more on a dedicated sound system, but for general, everyday use, the Echo Dot is brilliant. Sound remained stable even at maximum volume, and just as good I found Alexa was able to hear my commands despite cranking the volume up.Something new to the Generation 5 is the introduction of “tap to pause”. A quick tap on the dome of the Echo will pause your music. A simple addition, but so welcome. When someone rings me when I’m working a quick tap is so much better than yelling at Alexa to shut up before I can accept the call. Another tap will resume the music.I have to say, even two years down the line, I still prefer the shape of the Echo Dot Gen 3. I just preferred the puck-shape, and it sat lower to the ground so didn’t obstruct the view of the monitors on my desk. The buttons for volume, action and turning off the microphone are on top of the globe are raised characters resembling a games controller. The status light is around the base of the speaker rather than the top on Gen 3 and earlier devices.Setting up the Echo is, as usual, very simple. If you have a previous Alexa system them it connects straight to your existing network with no input at all. If it’s your first Echo device and assuming you have the Alexa app you go to Devices, Add, Amazon Echo, and wait for it to connect. The work of moments, and then it’s ready to go. Like the Gen 3 and 4 it uses its own power cable rather than a USB cable as the Gen 1 & 2 used.So, the verdict? The RRP, and reviewed price, is £54.99 which is £5 more than the outgoing Gen 4. The tap to pause feature almost makes up that £5 for me. I read in early press releases that the new Gen 5 can also be used as a Wi-fi repeater in compatible mesh systems such as the Eero range, but I didn’t see anything further mention that in the Amazon sales page and I’ve not been able to test that out. Just like the Gen 4 before it, the Gen 5 will almost certainly become the biggest selling smart speaker on the market. I’ve been more than happy with it in my early time with it and find it to be a great albeit minor evolution of the previous Dot.Once again though, the only real competition to Echo Dot is its own predecessors. The Gen 3 Echo Dot is still available at the time of writing. It’s almost as good to listen to, and I think looks nicer. It’s also quite a bit cheaper. Is the Gen 5 that much better than the Gen 3 to warrant the price premium? I’m not so sure, but I do like to keep up with the latest releases where possible.Taken in isolation, the Gen 5 Amazon Echo Dot is an excellent smart speaker. I gave the Gen 3 and Gen 4 a five-star review, and the Gen 5 gets the same accolade. It will undoubtedly go on to be the best-selling product of its type.How to set it up you Echo device:If you’re new to the world of Alexa then you may be wondering how easy it is to set up an Echo device. If you’ve ordered from Amazon, they’ll helpfully email you a guide to setting it up. You’ll need the Amazon Alexa app, available from both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Download and wait for it to install, and then open it up. The app gives help on various subjects if you tap the question mark in the top right corner of the home screen. The guide on setting up your new Echo Dot is found in this area by selecting Alexa Devices, then Echo Dot, and Set Up Your Echo Dot.As a quick overview though, plug in your Echo Dot (after a short period the status light will turn orange to show it is in Setup mode) and then open the Alexa app. On the bottom menus select “Devices”. On the Devices screen, tap the “+” button in the top right and choose “Add Device”. Select “Amazon Echo” and then “Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and more”. Assuming your Echo is plugged in and the status light is orange, select “Yes”. The app will then search for your new Echo Dot and complete the setup. The whole process takes only a few moments, and then you’re ready to get creative with Skills and Routines.What you can do with Alexa:A smart speaker is actually quite dumb to start with. It’s when you start adding things that it becomes truly smart in my view. On its own, you’ll be able to ask Alexa questions, play a few games, set up alarms and reminders and get a weather forecast; the general things you’d expect from a home assistant. Remember to always begin every command with the wake word, “Alexa…”, which can be altered to “Amazon”, “Echo” or “Computer” if you wish. To do certain things and play games you need to enable “Skills & Games”, which is found in the “More” menu at the bottom of the app. In there, you’ll find hundreds of things you can do with Alexa. For example, I regularly play the BBC quiz shows Pointless and Tenable. “Alexa, what is the weather forecast” or “Alexa, give me a ten-minute countdown” are examples of simple commands.As I say though, the Echo is just the gateway to a vast array of smart applications. How smart it goes depends on how far you want to go and how much to spend. What starts out as a single Echo device can quickly expand to a device in every room, attached to smart devices such as light bulbs, sockets, central heating and cameras. The first thing you may wish to use your speaker for is playing music. Echo is compatible with most of the main music streaming services such as Apple and Spotify, and of course Amazon Music. With your Echo you get access to Amazon Music’s free service, which is actually pretty good. It is limited, and you won’t find all of your favourite artists, but I recommend you try it out for a week or two as it might be good enough for your requirements. If not, I do highly recommend upgrading to Amazon Music Unlimited, or better still Amazon Music Unlimited Family which can be shared with multiple family members (not necessarily in the same household). I’ve not encountered many songs that aren’t on there. I used to have my iPhone full of mp3 music, but now I stream everything. “Alexa, play some 80’s rock” and I’m good for hours.

            Two years have passed since I reviewed the Amazon Echo Dot Gen 4 and now we have the new Echo Dot Gen 5 so it’s time to revisit the world of Alexa.If you’re familiar with Echo and Alexa, you’ll only be interested in the first part of this review and you can ignore everything after my device appraisal. I’m sure, though, that many people may be new to smart speakers so I’ve also added sections on how to install the Alexa app, how to set up your new speaker and what you can subsequently do with the Echo Dot. My apologies for going over things that you might already know and a lot of this repeats from my previous review, but there will be for which this is new territory.The Device:The Echo speakers have been around for many years now, and despite the best efforts of Google and Apple, Amazon’s Alexa still remains the smart assistant of choice. The most popular of all smart speakers is the Echo Dot. Other bigger and better sounding speakers are available including Amazon’s own larger Echo, but the Echo Dot has always hit a nice sweet spot of performance and affordability. The first couple of generations of Echo Dots were clearly toes in the water to see if we were ready for smart assistants. They gave us a glimpse of what could be achievable, but they didn’t sound particularly good. We’ve still got a couple of Generation 2 Echo Dots that live in the garage and shed, and they really do sound tinny and weak. That changed with the Generation 3 Echo Dot, of which we have seven around the house, as they sounded so much better. The sound was deeper and the volume could go much higher before losing fidelity. The microphone was also improved, and the entire experience with using Alexa made a big step forward.Two years ago I bought an Echo Dot Generation 4 on release day, and shortly afterwards followed that up with the larger Echo. And today, the Generation 5 arrived. I’ve spent several hours since then playing with it, testing it out alongside my existing speakers and the very similar Generation 4.So, what’s different between the Gen 4 and 5? Well, visually, not very much. The only real difference I could spot was the loss of an auxiliary port from the rear of the new device. Beyond that, no difference at all. I read from the press releases that the 5 is sonically much improved over the 4, but in side-by-side testing I struggled to see much difference between the two. If anything, I felt that Alexa’s voice when she’s talking to you seems like she’s stood a little further away. But it still sounds great. Not just great for the money, but great in general.We have much bigger and better speakers in our house, but when listening to music we almost always play it through the Echo Dots. I’ve got a Bose speaker right next to the Dot in my office, but always use the Dot for music. I work from home and I’m in my office 9-16 hours per day, and the Echo Dot is on for most of that time. If you want the absolute best sound, you’re likely to want to spend much more on a dedicated sound system, but for general, everyday use, the Echo Dot is brilliant. Sound remained stable even at maximum volume, and just as good I found Alexa was able to hear my commands despite cranking the volume up.Something new to the Generation 5 is the introduction of “tap to pause”. A quick tap on the dome of the Echo will pause your music. A simple addition, but so welcome. When someone rings me when I’m working a quick tap is so much better than yelling at Alexa to shut up before I can accept the call. Another tap will resume the music.I have to say, even two years down the line, I still prefer the shape of the Echo Dot Gen 3. I just preferred the puck-shape, and it sat lower to the ground so didn’t obstruct the view of the monitors on my desk. The buttons for volume, action and turning off the microphone are on top of the globe are raised characters resembling a games controller. The status light is around the base of the speaker rather than the top on Gen 3 and earlier devices.Setting up the Echo is, as usual, very simple. If you have a previous Alexa system them it connects straight to your existing network with no input at all. If it’s your first Echo device and assuming you have the Alexa app you go to Devices, Add, Amazon Echo, and wait for it to connect. The work of moments, and then it’s ready to go. Like the Gen 3 and 4 it uses its own power cable rather than a USB cable as the Gen 1 & 2 used.So, the verdict? The RRP, and reviewed price, is £54.99 which is £5 more than the outgoing Gen 4. The tap to pause feature almost makes up that £5 for me. I read in early press releases that the new Gen 5 can also be used as a Wi-fi repeater in compatible mesh systems such as the Eero range, but I didn’t see anything further mention that in the Amazon sales page and I’ve not been able to test that out. Just like the Gen 4 before it, the Gen 5 will almost certainly become the biggest selling smart speaker on the market. I’ve been more than happy with it in my early time with it and find it to be a great albeit minor evolution of the previous Dot.Once again though, the only real competition to Echo Dot is its own predecessors. The Gen 3 Echo Dot is still available at the time of writing. It’s almost as good to listen to, and I think looks nicer. It’s also quite a bit cheaper. Is the Gen 5 that much better than the Gen 3 to warrant the price premium? I’m not so sure, but I do like to keep up with the latest releases where possible.Taken in isolation, the Gen 5 Amazon Echo Dot is an excellent smart speaker. I gave the Gen 3 and Gen 4 a five-star review, and the Gen 5 gets the same accolade. It will undoubtedly go on to be the best-selling product of its type.How to set it up you Echo device:If you’re new to the world of Alexa then you may be wondering how easy it is to set up an Echo device. If you’ve ordered from Amazon, they’ll helpfully email you a guide to setting it up. You’ll need the Amazon Alexa app, available from both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Download and wait for it to install, and then open it up. The app gives help on various subjects if you tap the question mark in the top right corner of the home screen. The guide on setting up your new Echo Dot is found in this area by selecting Alexa Devices, then Echo Dot, and Set Up Your Echo Dot.As a quick overview though, plug in your Echo Dot (after a short period the status light will turn orange to show it is in Setup mode) and then open the Alexa app. On the bottom menus select “Devices”. On the Devices screen, tap the “+” button in the top right and choose “Add Device”. Select “Amazon Echo” and then “Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and more”. Assuming your Echo is plugged in and the status light is orange, select “Yes”. The app will then search for your new Echo Dot and complete the setup. The whole process takes only a few moments, and then you’re ready to get creative with Skills and Routines.What you can do with Alexa:A smart speaker is actually quite dumb to start with. It’s when you start adding things that it becomes truly smart in my view. On its own, you’ll be able to ask Alexa questions, play a few games, set up alarms and reminders and get a weather forecast; the general things you’d expect from a home assistant. Remember to always begin every command with the wake word, “Alexa…”, which can be altered to “Amazon”, “Echo” or “Computer” if you wish. To do certain things and play games you need to enable “Skills & Games”, which is found in the “More” menu at the bottom of the app. In there, you’ll find hundreds of things you can do with Alexa. For example, I regularly play the BBC quiz shows Pointless and Tenable. “Alexa, what is the weather forecast” or “Alexa, give me a ten-minute countdown” are examples of simple commands.As I say though, the Echo is just the gateway to a vast array of smart applications. How smart it goes depends on how far you want to go and how much to spend. What starts out as a single Echo device can quickly expand to a device in every room, attached to smart devices such as light bulbs, sockets, central heating and cameras. The first thing you may wish to use your speaker for is playing music. Echo is compatible with most of the main music streaming services such as Apple and Spotify, and of course Amazon Music. With your Echo you get access to Amazon Music’s free service, which is actually pretty good. It is limited, and you won’t find all of your favourite artists, but I recommend you try it out for a week or two as it might be good enough for your requirements. If not, I do highly recommend upgrading to Amazon Music Unlimited, or better still Amazon Music Unlimited Family which can be shared with multiple family members (not necessarily in the same household). I’ve not encountered many songs that aren’t on there. I used to have my iPhone full of mp3 music, but now I stream everything. “Alexa, play some 80’s rock” and I’m good for hours. If you have multiple speakers you can have the music played to one, many or all of them for house-wide coverage.Philips Hue lightbulbs are fantastic devices. They’re very expensive compared to a standard LED bulb, but once you buy one and use it in conjunction with Alexa voice control you soon become hooked.

I jumped up from the Echo 1 to the Dot 5 and I have to say I am very impressed. The sound quality is outstanding (Sorry to the neighbors for testing max volume). As with any Echo the setup is easy, you barely have to do anything to get it going. I picked mine up on the Spring sale and it was just a fantastic deal.The build quality is excellent and the voice recognition/responses are the best out there for voice assistants.

This tiny powerhouse surprises with its impressive sound and features. Alexa covers everything from alarms to tunes, and the audio quality surpasses expectations for its size.Favorites:Rocking Sound: Despite its size, the Dot pumps out rich, full sound that fills my room.Alexa, My Helper: Whether for weather updates or fun facts, Alexa's always ready.Tap and Go: New tap gestures are handy for quick adjustments.Stylish and Eco-friendly: sleek on my nightstand and made with recycled materials.Considerations:Not Audiophile-Grade: Fantastic for everyday listening.Amazon Account Required: You'll need one for Alexa's full potential.Deezer Integration: Occasionally finicky.Overall, the Echo Dot (5th gen) is a steal for its price. I highly recommend it for a versatile and fun smart speaker!Bonus Tip: Pair two dots for stereo sound. Boom!P.S. Watch for Amazon deals, discounts on Echo devices are common. I hope this helps you decide!

We have a black Labrador bitch, who suffered from stiffness especially in the evenings.  This supplement was recommended to us by a vet and a number of other nearby dog owners.They are given once a day and we give our lab three a day.  We tried giving it by hand but she refused them.  We now put them at the bottom of her food bowl and as she’s a lab, her food isn’t in her bowl long enough for her to notice the tablets and we’ve no longer had a problem with her taking them.Since she has been taking the tablets, we have noticed that she has a lot more energy and the stiffness seems to have gone.  Buying the tablets in the tub of 300 seems to be the best value and I’d recommend these to anyone with a dog with mobility issues!If you found this review helpful, can you please help me by clicking on the helpful button.

The Simpsons: Hit & Run
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2016Verified Purchase
The Simpsons: Hit & Run is, to this day, the best Simpsons game produced - even beating EA's ""The Simpsons Game"".The game takes a but out of the best-selling GTA games and makes them kid-friendly, ridding of the guns and adding all our lovable Simpsons characters. The game is a blast to play even just driving around town causing havok, yet alone completing all the missions and collecting all the cars and character models. The game is riddled with Simpsons refrences for hardcore fans - the best examples being the quotes the characters say as they drive (Homer running over a huge group of people while chanting ""I am Evil Homer! I am Evil Homer!"" never gets old) and the cards the character collects, each refrencing a specific Simpsons game. Finding all cards in a certain level unlocks a track in the bonus game, a simple racing mini-game. This is really nothing special and won't detract from the main experience.Overall, I a great game and a PlayStation 2 must-have, especially for hardcore Simpsons fans.

You don’t need me to tell you the prestige of this game, simply look at other reviews. This game is a MUST HAVE for simpsons fans and “collectathon” enthusiasts alike. The voices are all true to the real actors (I believe all of them are authentic), sound is good, gameplay is extremely satisfying, the cutscenes are pretty for an old game and the story is hilarious. Given huge portions of Springfield to explore, with so many hidden gags, collectibles and secrets, and wrapped up with the humour, enjoyable gameplay and hours of fun, it’s no wonder this game is in the hearts of many retro gamers. This game really could be charged for double in a few years: if you have a working PS2/GameCube you simply must get this game.

Room for improvement, but great none the less..
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 February 2004Verified Purchase
For sure, the best Simpsons game yet. Must be based on the GTA3 engine, basically because the gameplay is 100% the same as the recent Grand Theft Auto games. Where it differs is that you get to play the game as all your favourate Simpsons characters and visit everywhere in Springfield that has ever appeared in an episode. Again comparing it to GTA3 - what it lacks in the 'fun-killing' and gore it makes up for with humour. Some of the things the characters say are hilarious. However, most of the missions are ""collect 'em all before the time runs out"" or ""pass the checkpoints in time"" which gets tedious to say the least at some points. You will find yourself restarting missions again and again because you made a tiny mistake, as some of the missions demand perfect driving. Aside from the last couple of points, a brilliant game, a must for all Simpsons fans. This game gets a 4/5 from me.

Brilliant phone (beware of cases)
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2022Wireless provider: UnlockedColour: Mystic BronzeMemory storage capacity: 256 GBVerified Purchase
This phone arrived in fairly good timing, it set up well and worked brilliantly. I noticed as I started using it that there were a lot of ""blind spots"" where the S-pen wouldn't work on the phone. Long story short, I got in touch with the refurbishing company thinking it was faulty. (they were extremely accommodating) I decided to research these ""blind spots"" just in case it was a common problem, but I found it can actually be caused by detachable wallet cases. I have one of these so I tried the S-pen without it and of course everything works perfectly.Apparently the strong magnets in the back of the case can mess with the sensors in the phone's screen, so if you do end up going with this phone (or any other phone that includes a pen) I'd recommend staying away from detachable cases ;).The phone itself is wonderful, camera is great, loads of storage, it's pretty fast and the pen has a bunch of features. All in all I'd say it's a great phone and the company is very reliable.

I bought this phone to take to France as my father was ill there.It was delivered unpacked taken as a trusted device and sadly my father died. Completely reliant on this phone it just stopped working.Blank screen would not charge unresponsive.Tested on a main computer the battery was dead. We were left stuck in rural France with no mobile phone. It was catastrophic. I was devastated. Relying on the help of kind strangers and expats we struggled without a phone when we needed it the most.The phone was WARM DRY KEPT IN A CASE.On our return we sent this back to Amazon under the years warranty (what a bad joke) sent it off in 100% perfect condition.This rotten company refused to honour the warranty stating it was our fault, 'extreme water ingression'. Interesting since we did not swim, go to the beach, take it in a bath or a shower and there was no rain with a temp if between 28° - 35° daily.Even though water ingression was blamed, it was delivered back today smashed to pieces by a hammer. These people do not care, have no conscience and we hope no one decent, kind honest or honourable buys from this so called company and we put it in the hands of Karma.

Received phone pretty much the next day. Maybe 2 can't remember. Phone is in immaculate condition. Looks brand new! After updating it to the latest software(s) (android 10,11,12, and finally 13, I realised the S pen doesn't connect at all. I think the S pen's battery is completely dead on arrival. The pen still works on the touch screen but the Bluetooth functionality doesn't work. Can't connect and never connected. I am going to have to buy another pen separately. Other than that, the phone is brilliant. Battery holds its charge all day. Can't ask for anything more for the price. Glad I waited instead of paying £1200 on release. Phone still holds up today compared to the s23 ultra. Few less features (camera etc but in the N20U you can still use micro SD cards which I love because I have carried one through all of my phones.Great service other than the issue with the pen but can't expect everything for the price.

Samsung behemoth
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2021Wireless provider: UnlockedColour: Mystic BronzeMemory storage capacity: 256 GBVerified Purchase
I've been nursing my Galaxy Note 8 through its ever decreasing battery life for a very long time, in the hope that Samsung would finally release a new Note with 4K screen, so that I can use my VR headset without the annoying 'screen door' effect.So what happened? Samsung decided to end its collaboration with Occulus instead. I suspect it was to deliberately spite me! And, as Samsung also didn't release a new Note this year, I bought this, older, Note 20 Ultra instead.I knew that I would be buying a refurbished handset. But I was okay with that. I tell everyone it's so that I can do my little bit for the planet by not buying new, and being in favour of recycling. But the truth is, I saved myself some money, and if Samsung release a new Note next year, I might take another look.So, onto the handset. It arrived in a plain generic box, with no frills and no accessories save an unbranded, generic USB charging cable. It does, however, have a 12 month, money back guarantee (reassuring).I am very pleased with my purchase. The phone is completely unblemished and, for all intents and purposes, looks brand new. Everything works exactly as I would expect, and setting up and transfer of data from my old phone was simple (but not quick!).The battery, whilst much better than my Note 8, still requires a charge throughout the day to give me a full day's use. But then, I do use my phone a lot. To be fair though, it is better.The process of getting the phone to work with every application as well as my old one takes time. But then, that's the same for every new phone; visiting websites that requires passwords, or online banking etc. And can't be done in an hour or so, but that's not the fault of the phone, more a fact of life now.All in all, I am very happy with this purchase, and would give serious consideration to buying from the seller again. Highly recommended.

A good test of the refund system
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2022Size Name: 3mVerified Purchase
Bought this to connect a Surface Pro 4 (SP4) to a display or TV at a decent resolution. Unfortunately the testing never got as far as checking out the resolution.It didn't work at all connecting to the TV's HDMI, or to the Yamaha RX-V's HDMI input... (a) the TV just didn't see it at all, and (b) the SP4 couldn't make sense of it either - on connection, having got the display options screen ready on the SP4 first, the SP4's display just went black, flickering occasionally to the display options screen for teasingly short glimpses.It was the same story when connecting to a 32in AOC monitor. The connector was tried both direct to the SP4 and also connecting via the SP4 dock. Again, the flickering/black display and no way of getting it set up to work. It has to be said that a short Mini-DP to female HDMI adapter previously purchased on Amazon worked perfectly, just at a relatively limited resolution as per the product's description.Seeing as this product's description specifically states compatibility with the SP4, it was a rather disappointing experience.On the plus side, the cable and connectors are beautifully designed and made and give the impression of lasting the distance. Also, kudos to Amazon for the hassle-free refund which has been received on return-posting using the supplied label, even before the item has been received back at Amazon.

Doesn't work well with MacBook Pro
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2020Size Name: 1mVerified Purchase
Brought the cable to connect my MacBook Pro mid 2012 with my computer monitor. The cable seems to be made from high quality materials but it is a very temperamental. Sometimes it works and sometimes there is no signal received by my monitor which then causes issues with my MacBook display that could only be resolved by restarting my system. To troubleshoot the problem, I purchased a new Belkin cable to test my system and all the issues that I had previously disappeared. Thus I arrived at the conclusion that this cable even though advertised as being suitable for Mac, really isn't. So if you are a Mac user looking for a cable to connect your Mac to a monitor or TV, I would recommend paying a bit more for a Belkin cable instead.

I received my camera 2 days after purchasing. Well packaged and easy to open.After charging my battery for an hour and a half, I was able to start pretty much straight away, bar a couple of standard camera settings to change. I have yet to fiddle around with the settings more, but so far am very pleased with this camera. A few reviews I have read complain about dark pictures, but I do not have this issue. Only thing I was slightly disappointed about was the zoom, which isn't the camera's or the manufacturer's fault. Before buying this camera I had no clue as to how strong an 18-55mm lens was, and despite being slightly disappointed, I now know the strength and have given in and purchased a 55-200mm lens to compliment it further. Not that the landscape or zoom photos I have taken are bad in any way. One thing I am very pleased with is the close up setting. I have taken some beautiful photos of plants in my garden, some insects and my jewellery. Some pictures don't turn out and are a bit fuzzy, but I took several at once in succession and got some lovely photos of every subject I photographed. I have also taken some wonderful photos of my Jack Russell, who isn't exactly the most calm and still animal, both close up and from further away. The photos look ok on the camera, but you can really see a difference when you view them on a HD laptop and they turn out stunning. Obviously, not being a knowledgeable SLR photographer and having only just started out in the world of SLRs, I cannot compare the camera or lens to any others, but I am very pleased with the product. One thing, however, that I don't like is not being able to view a photo in the viewfinder before taking a photo. I don't know if this is because you can't or because I haven't worked out how to set it that way yet. I will need to read through the guide more thoroughly, but for the moment I'm not sure you can. If you can, it would probably have been nicer to make it easier to set it that way, but this might be down to a fault of my own or misreading an instruction. I will have to investigate it further.I plan on taking this camera to my upcoming scientific field trip to Java and Borneo, and with the complimentary 55-200mm lens I have recently bought (but not yet received as I only bought it today)I hope to take some wonderful photos.

I am using a Nikon D3000, and currently very happy with the camera so far (I have had it about 8 months now).The CCD sensor for the camera is of a good size and pixel count of just under 11 million.  It can take SD and SDHC card and I have not had any problems using two card. This can also shoot in RAW as well which is a handy format to shoot in, if you like to use RAW that is. Overall weight of the device is impressive and is fairly light for a robust body, with an 18-55 lens on the body it's a good weight and the weight feels more central that most cameras I have used.Unlike a lot of view finders this one (apart from information such as batt life and focusing points) is non-digital and you can view though this and see what you want to shoot unlike digital ones in which you must have the camera turned on in order to do this. I would say that you view about 90 percent of the picture you want to take though the view finder.The back display screen is of a good size and rotates it's self automatically if you hold the camera portrait or landscape. It's a very clear screen which you can adjust the brightness on. The screen is not touch screen.It's also fairly cheap and even cheaper if you get the body and 18-55 lens kit bundle, you could call it an entry level camera but it does the job, and has a vast range of functions and options and you can fully customize this as much or as little as you like. I have found the auto and guide functions rather good as well, when I am feeling lazy and not wanting to mess around with fine tuning my camera to the environment I want to shoot in.I have used the Nikon D3000 for a wide range of photography from landscapes, race tracks and speedways, equine disciplines,  model work to name a few and the camera performed very well indeed. I have also used this camera in wet stormy conditions to dry hot sunny weather, and again the camera didn't put a foot wrong.One thing that this camera doesn't do is shoot video, so if you want a camera that does both this isn't for you.Well hope that helps

Great entry-level DSLR
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 March 2010Style Name: Kit incl. 18-55 mm VR lens (image stabiliser)Verified Purchase
Having owned several point-and-shoot cameras since 2003, I wanted to take it to the next level and I found this camera ensured a smooth transition.Guide mode is a good starting point, it begins by asking you about the shoot type you want to do and then sets the camera and gives you tips for making it. Another cool feature is that every menu has explanatory pictures so they are very intuitive.After some time playing with the Guide mode, I moved into the more advanced P, S, A modes which are common to all DSLRs and again, the transition was smooth.Missing points? Maybe live-view for some compromised shots.Overall the D3000 is a great camera, takes fantastic pictures and it's excellent value for money.

Bought as a gift for a friend that really likes rum and he was super pleased.  I am not a rum drinker but I tried the aroma and could only get a hint of coconut but, when I tasted a small shot I had to say WOW, pure coconut; it was a clean taste too, not like a sticky syrup that comes when drinking a certain other alcohol coconut drink.  It was so good, I had another & larger shot of it.

If you like the more popular rum flavored liqueur which you can get everywhere beginning with M then you will love this full flavored true coconut rum alternative , the only thing you need to remember is its more than double the ABV of that other rum liqueur, and believe it or not has a much better coconut flavor and taste , its excellent with just pineapple juice and few ice cubes but also is fantastic in cocktails but remember if you use this for better flavor in cocktails to replace the M brand to bare in mind the extra ABV , this is my go to coconut rum rather than the old go to brand , and at a few quid dearer its the real deal .

Actually tastes nice!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2024Flavour Name: MangoVerified Purchase
I appreciate the convenience of FS Greens for integrating essential nutrients into my diet, especially since achieving optimal nutrition solely from food can be challenging. Alongside a diet rich in fish and vegetables, FS Greens enhances my nutrient intake, significantly reduces bloating, boosts energy cleanly, and even eases hangover symptoms. Surprisingly, the mango flavour is quite nice, a notable achievement given my usual aversion to artificial mango tastes (of all ""fruit"" tastes, mango is by far the worst). While it's not a chocolate milkshake, it's far more enjoyable than similar products, which often have unpleasant odours and aftertaste. FS Greens stands out in this regard, offering a competitive price and a seamless addition to my daily routine. I would note, that if you don't have this in about a pint of water, you get a lot of sediment at the bottom. I've found that at least 550ml (a pint, in other words) and a very vigorous mix will get you a smooth drink with hardly any sediment at the bottom of your drink.

Worked well
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 August 2023Size Name: 1 x 7mlVerified Purchase
This worked well and even after washing the shower the next day with cif cream cleaner the grout stayed nice and white.Only negative is that the tip that needs to be pushed in several times to load up with the white liquid gets ruined easily. So despite there being lots of liquid left to paint the gout with, the nip won't push in anymore because it has frayed apart and no longer functions. So there was enough white liquid to complete the shower but I had to order a second one to finish the job.

Works really well and does what it should, whitens the grout great.  Can go over again once dried if grout is overly stained and lightens even more.  The last for a long time as long as you dont press on the tip too hard.  Couple of pumps of the tip is all you should need to get the whitener going  just dont be too forceful when pumping the tip as this may damage it.  Hope that doesn't sound to you like it does to me lol and hopefully you get my drift!

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2023Size Name: 1 x 7mlVerified Purchase
This so called product, (The Unibond grout reviver pen) is the biggest load of rubbish & waste of money I have ever purchased, I consider myself as quite adept at DIY & enjoy taking on most jobs & after decorating my bathroom I realised that due to the condition of my tiles & grout being quite good I would try the aforementioned grout pen to spruce them up, (what a mistake that was to be).I followed the instructions to the letter which isn't rocket science, shake the pen, press the nib, ( but not too hard ) onto a piece of paper until the liquid is released, ( so far so good ) then gently squeeze ( but not too hard ) onto the grout & gently move along grout line, after doing five 6"" tiles the nib split into what looked like frayed string & therefore wouldn't press back into the pen to release the grout liquid rendering it about as useful as a chocolate fire guard.I spent nearly £12 for 2 of these pathetic, useless, infuriating little pieces of rubbish & ended up actually scraping out & regrouting my tiles which I actually enjoyed doing a lot more than messing about with the aforementioned pile of junk.This is only my experience & my opinion but please be careful when thinking of buying this product, it's equally annoying as I've bought Unibond products in the past & never had a problem, 0 out of 10 & no stars for this one 👎

Absolute bargin of a phone.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2023Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
At £280 for a phone that started out life at £499 this phone is an absolute steal. It is probably worth the £499 price tag, but at £280 it becomes a no brainer. Its such a good all-rounder that I'm struggling to fault it. The camera is excellent, the screen is brilliant and the battery life superb. The only 'so called' fly in the ointment is processing power. But let me be clear... I have had no problem with its processor speed, not one. It's only in comparison to far more expensive phones that the processor falls short. Perhaps if you multi task on your phone and have multiple apps open at once, you may notice some lag. But I and your average phone user doesn't need that much processing power. So the A54 is perfectly adequate for every day use. Also if you are a big phone gamer,  then this is perhaps not the phone for you. Sound is on a par with more expensive phones and is stereo. Build quality feels very, very good with glass front and back. Video is also very, very good. Yes, there are better phones out there for sure. But none in this price bracket (under £300) can compete with the A54. I believe this phone at this price is a true bargin and that's not something you see very often these days.

This replaced an A70 that although met my needs was limited to G3 - which of course is going to be switched off in the future. The A54 is on G5. Loads of improvements of course but in general terms would say just about everything is configurable. A number of utube vids helped enormously in coming to terms with the options that are available. In the event it wasn't about the financial outlay - on which I found a cracking saving - it was about improved performance, great camera (I'm not a professional) and well displayed output.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 November 2023Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
Phone appears fabulous, colour is great, easy to swap over from my other Samsung. Battery life is great and phone is easy to use and fast delivery. The only fault I do have is that in the selling description it says it comes with phone charger, screen protector and earphones and it doesn't, I made contact and they said no it doesn't I explained its in the selling advert but I heard nothing back which I think is not a good selling point, so no I wouldn't buy from them again as poor communication and no offer of anything at all in regards to false advertising.

Loving this phone so far
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 October 2022Colour: ObsidianSize Name: 128GBStyle Name: Pixel 7 ProVerified Purchase
If you watch MKBHD or Dave2D etc on YouTube, you'll see proof of how good this phone is. I've had it since yesterday and I am really loving it so far. I switched from a OnePlus 7Pro which I had for about 4 years, it had served me well but it was starting to get slow.The Google Pixel 7 Pro has been a brilliant upgrade. It truly feels like smartest smartphone on the market. It is extremely intuitive and has lots have nice little additions that make your life easier. The screen is lovely and a great size, especially the 120Hz refresh rate! Battery has lasted a long while for a 1440p screen with a high refresh rate.The sound is slightly tinny I'll admit, but it prioritises voice clarity, so it makes up for it in that region.The camera is outstanding, really on par with Samsung and iPhone. The processing, sharpness, and colour is very realistic and uses that HDR well. It is especially great with it's neat features like Magic Eraser and Face Unblur.The pain has been that it does not come with a wall charger which means I'm panicking about buying one from the Google store. I'm currently using a Mac charger lead which is probably not ideal.This phone really does make smile with all its intelligent little features. It all works swiftly and smoothly, especially the Google Wallet and multitasking.I am in my 20s and would consider myself a techie. So I really recommend this! Excited to get my free Google earbuds pro. I would suggest not getting the smartwatch as from what I'm hearing, the battery is no good and it is too small. Whereas, the earbuds are supposedly the best on the market.

I upgraded from an Honor 9 that I'd had for nearly 5 years.  I bought it through the Amazon Wearhouse in like new condition for a great saving and it was pristine!This phone is amazing!  I love the photo quality and editing ability. The built-in assistant that I've set a morning routine that sets an alarm, tells me a joke, my plans for the day and then plays my Spotify playlist. It's fast for browsing social media and playing games too.  I also really like the keyboard response when you're typing.  Fingerprint sensor and face recognition work brilliant and the battery lasts all day.  Charging can take a bit longer than my last phone, but hopefully that will preserve the life of the battery.So pleased that I've chosen this phone and I hope it lasts as long as my last one!

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 May 2023Colour: HazelSize Name: 256GBStyle Name: Pixel 7 ProVerified Purchase
Last google phone I had was a few years ago and called a Nexus 4. That was agreat phone and as my redmi note10 pro wasnt happy with a broken screen and being dropped in the sink, I though ""why not"" so after a lot of reasearch and price checking (Amazon was the cheapest) I bought this beauty. Strangley it was cheaper for the 256gb than the 128gb. So a case and screen protectors later and next day delivery had me chuckling like a first time user of a mobile phone. So I went with the hazel colour scheme and it really is a good looking colour. Feels good in the hand and has a screen thats so sharp. Anyhow, set up was a breeze even from the old redmi. Just follow the pixel instructions and away you go. Everything and I mean everything copied over including settings pics the lot. No issues at all. As regards the phone.....well constructed and a good 1.25 days battery life. Remembered you need to buy a charger brick as theres not one  included, but a recommendation sorted that out for under £16. Also double check that the chargers you use do infact work on the pixel as I've found a couple of first gen 'C' type dont. So all in all a good phone that isstreets ahead of anything else Ive had and is great to use.

Amazing Overall, Few Issues...
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 February 2024Colour: SnowSize Name: 256GBStyle Name: Pixel 7 ProVerified Purchase
My previous phone was 6 years old and still worked OK, but was starting to get a bit slow and bad with battery life, so I thought it was time to invest in a new one!I'm not a professional, I use my phone for basic things, so I don't need it to do anything fancy, but I was drawn to this one as I've seen good things about it, especially the camera.It's a really beautiful phone, and setting it up was so easy to do. I inserted my SIM card, got it fully charged, and followed the on-screen instructions. I used the cable provided to connect my old phone to this new one, and everything was transferred over, all my apps/contacts/photos etc. It couldn't have been easier.It's lovely to use, the screen is big and bright and high quality, and really responsive. I don't use face recognition or fingerprint lock, so I can't comment on those, but there are lots of little features I like. I've changed the settings so if I double tap the back of the phone it will take a screenshot. I think the battery life is great, (I don't really play games or watch TV/films often though) it's simple to use, and the camera is amazing, like I hoped it would be!Again, I'm not a professional, but I was so impressed with how the camera does most of the hard work for me, focusing on what I want to photo, blurring the background slightly, and just looking so clear and high quality. (see my flower photo) The 'unblur' and 'magic eraser' tools are brilliant, it's given new life to some old photos especially, which I've managed to edit.For an example, I took a simple photo of my garden, and managed to remove the yard brush/tree/2 solar lights, simply by circling them in Edit, and I think the result is great!However, I'm giving the phone 4/5 stars, as there were a couple things that disappointed me.Firstly, I know I'm probably behind with the times, and I didn't expect an actual plug to be included, but considering the price of the phone, I expected a USB charging cable included. You only get the double ended USB C cable, and since I don't have a USB C plug, I had to buy one.I was also disappointed that you can't insert an SD card into this phone. I went for the 256GB storage, so I don't think it will ever be an issue for me, and there are options to store photos etc elsewhere, but I felt like there should be an option to put one in if I wanted.Another little thing I noticed, is when I have been cropping photos or doing anything close to the edge of the screen, it can sometimes think I'm swiping, and it goes back, which is annoying.Overall, even with the issues I've said, I am really impressed and happy with my new phone. It works above and beyond what I need it for, and I haven't even scratched the surface of everything it can do.

            I absolutely adore this game the characters and stories are amazing and the picnics are the best part! A couple glitches and bugs here and there and the fps isn't the best but it's definitely not game ruining plus they fix it for you in game. Controls are pretty fun and easy. Arrived on time and in pristine condition! Very fun overall a couple's glitches but nothing too bad 10/10 would recommend this game! Favourite so far!

Don't buy Beats headphones
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 July 2021Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
These headphones are worth every penny.The materials, the look, the feel, the sound are impeccable, but what's most important for me: noise cancellation is great - if you download the Bose Connect app you can even choose to have NO noise cancellation, LOW level or HIGH level of noise cancellation. (I had the chance to try on the Bose 700 some time ago and if you're looking for a total noise cancellation effect, those are the ones to go.)Another reason why I'm so enthusiastic about these headphones is my horrible experience with my first pair of headphones (Beats). Do not fall victim of pushy salespersons like I unfortunately did.Three years ago I found myself wandering around the airport, trying to kill time because of my flight was delayed. I thought that could be the perfect moment to purchase a pair of headphones at a good price.I had already did some research and from the online reviews, the Bose headphones had the best noise cancelling system hands down. Even though I expressed my interest on the Bose and my concerns about wind noises during calls to the salesman, he kept on praising Beats. Unfortunately I listened and thought ""why not?"", after all the price was quite lower. DO NOT make my same mistake: the price was lower and after my experience I can say they were still overpriced. Calls were a pain with the lightest breeze or the lightest ""clothe stroking"", the play button stopped working properly after one and a half year, after three years I couldn't hear sound from my right ear (faulty contact) and the cover of the ear cushion are all ""unglued"" so the foam is exposed, plus they are too tight on the ears.I love how comfortable these Bose are and I'm sure they will last for a very long time.

DONT BUY ANYTHING UNTIL YOU READ THIS
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2019Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I have had the liberty of owning both headphones. The Bose QC35 Series 2 and the brand new Sony WH-1000XM3. I have used both for walking, aeroplane travel, travel on the underground in London and and general stuff like walking and around the house.The Sony’s - Greatly improves over the series 2 version of the headphones. They are a right fitting headphone, very loud and impressive base. You can fiddle with the base, treble and noise cancellation until your hearts content as it’s all adjustable via the app. The best thing about these is the noise cancellation. It is the market leader and has overtaken the Bose in this area. They are comfortable and made to high standards. You can even adjust the noise cancellation at different altitudes such as in the aeroplane and this works well. I actually fell asleep with them on recently which was a first as I hate flying. Wearing them and walking I did feel a bit weird for some reason. I think it was the noise cancelling software, perhaps it’s a little too good?The Bose’s - They feel lighter, easier to live with, more roomy than the Sony’s and not as tight a fit which I think makes the more comfortable. The noise cancellation is excellent and you can set them to high, low and off levels. The noise cancellation works very well, however not quite as good as the Sony’s, which you can fiddle with until your hearts content with the app. The sound quality is brilliant, you do get more mid level sound with the Bose, though the Sony’s were definitely louder with more richer base. I wish you could adjust the base and treble but you can’t or at least I can’t find out how you do it. You can adjust these setting with the Sony’s in the app.The winner for me was the Bose. When I began looking for noise cancelling headphones I first began looking for the ‘best cancelling’ on the market but there are many other factors you need to consider when making a buying decision. For me that issue was comfort and ensuring they are ‘fit for the purpose of the wearer.If like me you could end up wearing headphones for 2-6+hrs per day I would choose the Bose over the Sony’s in a heartbeat. They are lighter, your ears don’t get hot or sweaty when wearing them and they have more room. Yes the noise cancellation is very slightly substandard to the Sony’s when side by side testing (though still pretty amazing) and they aren’t as loud, but they are the best for all day wearers. If I only wanted to use my headphones for an hour or two per day, the Sony’s would win hands down (although I found them a little tight for my big head).I advise you to try both pairs, but consider the anount of time you’ll wear them for each day as comfort is really important when you have to live with these headphones. Consider the weight you like to have on your head, comfort around your ears such as the fit and tightness. Comfort becomes more important than being able to fiddle with sounds such as base and noise cancellation when you don’t actually like the things in your head. So please buy the most comfortable and then everything else will fall into ace and you’ll love your decision between these two amazing brands.Last point. If you go into a busy airport and watch the commuters in London you’ll quickly notice most people are wearing one brand in particular. You can guess which it is.

YES THEY ARE STILL AMAZING IN 2021!!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2021Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
If you are wondering whether you should buy these in 2021 then, the answer is YES!! I've been using these for nearly 3 years and thought it was time to ""upgrade"". I purchased the Airpods Max (yes I'm an idiot) and they were plagued with problems. They sounded better than this but were nowhere near as comfortable and lightweight as the Bose. I was getting like a 12-15 hours battery life out of the Airpods Max, they were so unreliable and would randomly drain battery overnight + condensation build-up on the drivers after about 2 hours use + buggy firmware, meant they were unbearable to use. So I returned them and got a refund. But I still wanted to ""upgrade"" so I purchased the next best consumer ANC headphone, the sony WH1000M4. Again, they sounded better than the bose. But personally, they weren't as comfortable as the Bose for me although they are lightweight. I also found many of its features to be gimmicky and didn't really use them. And although the Sony's did sound better intially, I didn't like the sound signature. It was way too bass heavy, although I liked it at first, it just become jarring to listen to music for a long time. The Bose also has a better build quality than the Sony's and it stores a little bit smaller. Basically, I never realised how amazing the Bose actually is. It has nice sound signature that means I can listen to music for hours on end, it's comfortable to wear for hours on end, it's build well and still has incredible ANC, even 3 years later, the Sony's might be marginally better. I also found the Sony's multi-device function more of a pain to use than the Bose's and not always as accurate or reliable. My only complaint with the Bose would be that I wish the bluetooth range was better, as soon as I leave the room and go next door, the connection stutters, it needs a line of sight ideally. Some kind of an ambient mode would also be nice when you're in a public environment, as even with ANC turned off, most of the sound is still very well isolated. The battery life is also excellent. So unless you will use all the features of the Sony to its full potential, these are still an incredible value pair of headphone, espcially for the price you can get these for now, nearly half of the Sony's at time if you look for it.

Girls,My period was late by 6 days, on a usual 29-31 M cycle.I was having very irritating cramping, similar to PMS cramps so I thought my period was coming.2 days later I was officially late on the Flo app, in total a whole week had gone past my predicted period - pretty much because I was having cramping all week thinking it would drop in a few hours.Decided to test last Saturday 24th March, not thinking anything of it - I thought no way I’m pregnant but just in case, as I may need to see the doc as variations of my cycle pass 7 days are extremely rare for me.Peed on the stick, around 2pm - I thought well they said morning pee but my period is like 6 days late, so what does it matter.As I was washing my hands, Within 30 seconds - 1 minute I saw the word “pregnancy”. I was shook, yes I know really?After 2 minutes or so it said 3+ which I believe is around like 4-5 weeks.Well I heard some negative reviews about the possibility of a “false positive”, so taking that into account.I waited again for the next day, I POS at around 6:06am in the morning, and again the same thing happed.Clearly I am very much pregnant, so if in doubt use both tests but my Dr. said it’s extremely rare to take two CB Digis and get a false reading- as they are 99% accurate.But I honestly couldn’t believe it, I had plans for a holiday in August, which will now be a much smaller baby moon.Very excited, if in doubt check twice, or wait a few days and do another CBT.Please bear in mind, if you are like me and waited a whole week or more to test after your expected period - You may get 3+ this is the highest and this will not change. The HCG threshold for this reading is over 2753 mIU/ml, according to their instructions- that’s pretty high.HCG rises in the first 1-6 weeks from conception and the the close to the 2nd trimester 8 weeks onwards it plateaus. HCG has done its job and the placenta is now doing most of the work.After this you won’t need anything else but to book your dating scan, if you’re anxious for whatever reason you can book an early dating scan 6+ weeks for peace of mind.But honestly the tests are accurate unless your on certain specific meds that produce the HCG hormone.Now please enjoy your pregnancy and don’t worry too much!Signed an excited Mum to Be.

My due date is August 4th and we told my parents by Thanksgiving. The tests were easy to use and easy to read. Rather than using it directly midstream, I recommend using a small disposable cup to capture your sample and then dipping the stick. Keep in mind that after a week or two the results will disappear, so they don’t necessarily make a keepsake or anything like that.

There is a difference in that the European version has a shoe box style box and a hard back art work book compared to the paperback version in the states. Not much difference in price but buy the European version for a better deal

Very comfy headphones the padding is amazing. I've not had to use them for an extended time yet but they feel like they will be fine for that.The colour looked lovely (I have the grey / gold)They don't feel too heavy on the head but there's enough weight to remind you that they are on your head.They even come with a lovely travel case which will be great when I'm on the move and don't want them getting damaged which is a great bonus.Sound wise very nice my music sounds great on them and has definitely gotten me listening to music more in my free time.The only con is the app is pretty basic and borderline useless I thought maybe id be able to adjust the sound levels and bass like I can with my earphones from another bran but alas you can basically check the battery level and change the name of your headphones.

Decent ANC, good sound, excellent battery and all round great headphones for bass lovers
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2021Verified Purchase
Unfortunately my 1st pair were stolen, these are so good I bought them again. I’ve actually own quite a few different Beats headphones and I have to say this is definitely the best wireless Beats headphones I have owned and listened to. I am no audiophile but I am someone who understands and enjoys good sounding audio. I know Beats have a reputation for being overpriced and bass heavy. I can confirm that for the normal average listener the Beats studio 3 wireless is brilliant, the sound is rich and balanced with very good mids and unlike some of the earlier iterations the bass is punchy without being muddy.Getting started and pairing the earphones is extremely easy and it's even simpler for iPhone users. You hold the down the pairing button on the headphones till the LED indicator flashes and a message appears on your iPhone to connect. It's literally that simple, once you hit connect you're up and running. At first the sound might not be what you expected, I recommend you keep using it and allow a day or so for the headphones to break in before you get the full benefit of the rich sound. You may find that the active noise cancelling (ANC) gives more of a better listening experience. It may not be as good as Bose but these Beats’ ANC is still very good.These Beats give you excellent control, on one ear you have volume control and play/pause which also doubles up as the rewind/fast forward button. On the other ear if the power button which also serves as the pairing and active noice cancelling button. This is so convenient because it gives you excellent control when listening to music meaning you don't have to reach for your phone as much. The battery life is great giving you just over 20 hours and the headphones comes with fast charge where if your battery is low 1 minute charge will give 3 hours of play.As much as I love these headphones there are a few things that would have made it perfect for me. I wish instead of mini USB the charging cable was USB type C or even lightning cable like the Power Beats pro. The build quality is decent and its design is very nice (especially the matte black) but at this price I wish it had more a premium look and finish.  Finally gesture control and auto play/pause when you take off and put on the headphones would’ve been a nice addition. Despite this I still find these earphones to be absolutely brilliant, they have definitely seen some drastic improvements since the past models. If you can afford it then definitely give them a go, they're well worth it. Hope this helps.

Beats most, but not all
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 November 2023Verified Purchase
These Beats Studio 3 Wireless headphones are very good, but with a few areas are lacking compared to their competition (mainly Sony & Bose.)The design is extremely fashionable, there's a good reason these are often worn by celebrities and endorsed  a lot in the fashion world - The Beats brand is cool to look at, and the whole package of the box and the hard carry case have a very sleek look and the even the logo just oozes style.One area of issue I have is with the build quality. Although these look great, there is a lot of thin, cheap plastic around the headband and arm bands. I accidentally dropped these once and I ended up with £90 worth of damage to the bands. Some of the competitors have much better builds with stronger bands and padding to reduce the possibility of damage.They are mostly comfortable to wear with good ear pads. I can wear them for a couple of hours in comfort but after that they do feel a bit heavy on the clamping force. Similar headphones are more comfortable from my experience.Battery life is very good. I get around 20 hours with ANC on. More than enough. Again, other competitors have a slightly higher battery life by about 2-3 hours.Controls are easy enough to use. On/off, volume controls and skipping are all very simple. The bluetooth pairing was quick and has been reliable, I can go around 20m away from my device before the connection starts to distort and cut out. I'm an Android user, so I can't comment on the W1 chip which is a selling point in Beats headphones for Apple users. From my research, these headphones tend to be preferable to Apple users for this reason as it fits the Apple ecosystem.Noise cancelling works effectively. They block out a very high degree of background noise and I'm able to focus on the music I'm listening to without distractions. They don't quite match up to Bose but they're not too far off.Sound quality is also very good. They have a strong, powerful expression. The Beats brand in general tend toward a higher level of Bass in the EQ, as you'd expect of a Dre endorsed headphone. These are one of the better headphones to wear if you're a hip-hop fan, but if you like a wide and eclectic mix of genres, a more neutral sound profile would be preferable, which other headphones out there provide.Overall, these are very good headphones, especially for Apple users and for fans of bass heavy music, such as hip-hop. The design is attractive, controls are easy to use and bluetooth is reliable. It has a high battery life and good sound quality overall, particularly if you're a bass fan. My issues are they are very easy to break due to poor build quality on the head and armbands, and they aren't comfortable for much longer than a couple of hours.Although I have an overall positive feeling for these headphones, I personally feel there are other options at this price range which offer better comfort, sound quality and a more durable build. I feel these are better if you get them discounted, as I think there are flaws that hold it back from being worth the full RRP.

This hibiscrub is a game-changer! My surgeon initially prescribed this for pre-surgery skin prep and wow, did it work wonders. Not only did it efficiently cleanse and prepare my skin for surgery, but I found an unexpected bonus when I continued to use the rest as a shower gel afterwards. My body odour, especially in the armpit and feet areas, has significantly improved! I feel refreshed and clean all day. I've tried numerous products over the years, but nothing has worked as well as this hibiscrub to combat odour. Highly recommended!

I brought this during lockdown, as a way of cleaning hands at home.  Nursing and veterinary friends recommended this, as a good way to wash hands.Some people maybe allergic to it, so you need to patch test at appropriate dilution.  I fill a pump bottle in kitchen for handwashing pre food prep with 20% Hibiscrub and 80% water.  Read the instruction leaflet inside for contra-indications and dilutions.When I had a trapped hair in arm pit last year, I used this to wash and clean insted of soap.  Lasts for 6 hours on skin (anti bacterial etc).  Worked well.  Sometimes I take blood sugar readings during keto fasting (I'm not diabetic or pre-diabetic), so I use the product to was fingers well before testing.Relative used it to clean irritated wound on their dog under vet supervision.Pink in colour.  Will lather well for hand washing.Only gripe is the cost.  It has risen in price alot, so I ensure I buy when its on offer.

Great game in a big group
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2024Style Name: Reduced PackagingVerified Purchase
Bought as a present for my partner for Christmas as she loves board games. She absolutely loved it. Have played a few times in a big group.The premise is a little complicated, but really easy to pick up. You hand out a fishes to all other participants. There is 1 blue fish and the rest are red. The player then picks a card with the answer on the back not visible to them and reads out the question. The red fish must make up a separate lie and the blue fish says the correct answer. The player then has to guess who stated the correct answer. With points allocated for guessing correctly or incorrectly. I found it really difficult to come up with different wrong answers that were similar to the correct answer to confuse the guesser. It is a good game for both adults and children, however, children are a little easier to tell when they are lying (normally all the fidgeting).Total play time was about 1 hour but it can be longer if you have more players. The game seems to be better with more players (5/6 players).Overall it was a really fun game, another great addition to our collection.

This is an easy to play game that went down a treat with my family. The game pieces are high quality and the instructions are easy to understand. The only slight down to this game is that the scoring is quite tricky to remember and the words printed on the cards aren't super clear for people with not-so-good eyesight, so the older family members struggled to read the cards when at a distance. We passed the card around for each person to read, but this made the game take longer and lose a little of it's quick pace. Besides that, it was very fun to play!

1l captain morgan spiced rum
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2023Size Name: 1 LVerified Purchase
Bought as a gift and at a great price, £18.This is the same size and price as in the supermarket currently, I forgot to buy it when doing my food shop, so had it sent to me the next day via prime to save me a trip.Fantastic service, packaged safely by amazon.The rum itself is a nice, sweet, smooth drink, the alcohol is good for a beginner, someone new to rums or those who don't like a drink to burn. I've personally always loved a rum with lemonade but this is nice just on its own or with ice. My Husband mixes with Irn bru!Would recommend.

As per the headline, I don't really drink spirits, I'm more of a lover of real ale or the occasional glass of wine. However since being introduced to it,with coke, i'll happily enjoy the odd glass or two enjoying those lovely flavours. At £19 for 1 litre it was also the best price I could find.

Better than ever really
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 August 2006Verified Purchase
Firstly, I'll try to offer a review thats written in good english..Its amazing to think that for over 10 years, this thing has been stuck in my bedroom, and connected to my portable t.v. Why? Quite simply, because it offers the gameplay, the imagination, and offers ""fun"" in games that modern games and consoles totally lack.On a personal note, the Playstation offers me a route back to the 90's. I was still a kid back then, and i'll always say they were the best years of my life more hundreds of reasons. My Playsation is always their for me if I just want a bit of escapism from the modern world!First game I played? The classic Crash Bandicoot, and I was hooked ever since. The colourful surroundings and humour surrounding the game was just start of an era for myself, and friends who got one when the console/game came out. And since then, nothing has changed. I still play on my original Playstation with mates, and we have such a laugh and a good time. You just cant do this with modern consoles (apart from the Wii). Instead, companies battle out to produce the best graphics, and forget about the most important thing that made this console popular - gameplay.For anyone who's never see/held/played on the original Playstation (no doubt their are people, thats why i'm writing the review), its approx the size of 2 and half DVD cases together, and the thickness of a good sized novel/book. Indeed, with its rather dirty looking grey colour, its not much to look at, but I think this reflects the era it was made in, because this was the Playstations signature colour - a brushed metal look. I'm a real 90's person, and whenever I glance at it, It brings back so many memories, many of staring into the Blockbuster video shop window and seeing the Playstation box, as everywhere was mad about it at the time.Technically, the loading times are average, but the thing i've noticed over the years most is the Memory Card loading/saving times, which now seem so, so slow. The graphics are obviously now dated. At just 32 bit, they're blocky, but who cares? Even as time went on the graphics imprived immensely! But I dont care anymore. And I dont think I ever did - I was too busy having fin! I think these dated graphics add character to the games/console very much, in a way the Nintendo 64 can't, because the 64bit chip offered such perfect polygons.If people come out with ""it keeps crashing, therfore its rubbish"" crap, then what they don't realise is that the console will actually crash more now than it did in 1994! This is because of a design fault - their is no fan. Over the 12 years the console has survived, the plastic strut that holds the laser head in a horizontal position warps with the heat, and this causes the laser to move out of alignment... thus it crashes because it can't read the disc properly. One common fix everyone I know we used to do was to tilt the console on its side, but not all consoles have become this bad.. so I hope that clears up a few mindless opinions. In fact I remember being at my friends one day, and to play ""Tenchu"", we had to stack it with just the right number of books! Incredible.So, why is it better than ever? Simply because of the state of games today, where companies rely on the graphics to sell the games. But I dont remember 'Pong' being a big hit for just 2 white squares, a dot and a line. Worth getting? Everytime! The Playstation is timeless. I'm fed up of people saying ridiculous things like ""Its not powerful enough!"" or ""Its got rubbish"". People forget this was made in 1994 - not 2007! This is far better than any of the next gen consoles I've owned simply because of the things that made gaming worth while - cheap games, simple controls, great multi-players, and most importantly, fantastic gameplay!In fact, you'd be stupid not to buy it at these prices! Unless you find one in a charity shop for a couple quid like I've seen hundreds of times....

nostalgia in a freakin box!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2015Verified Purchase
title day it all, this thing is awesome, yes its laughable by todays standards but who cares? In this day and age a phone that came out last year is considered laughable! This holds so many memories for so many people and for a lot of people this was their first game system. Resident evil, crash bandicoot, silent hill, tekken, grand theft auto, thats just a tiny amount of todays big franchises that started out on ps1. And many people will say the games were better back then, yea their a lot uglier than games today, but the gameplay was there. There was no such thing as dlc, two hour long system updates, there were no patches so developers had to work extra hard to make sure there were no glitches bugs or crashes. Not like today when they release half the game for full price and charge you extra for the rest as 'dlc' or reslease a half finished game then weeks later release a patch for it. Gaming industrys gone down the toilet if you ask me, yea its still going and admittly the newer systems are pretty good when they work correctly.  However this will always be the most special to me, it still sits in my entertainment center plugged in above my ps4 which barely gets used. I understand no ones gunna buy this as their main game system now, but still give it a try. Just put down the headsets and wireless controllers, plug this in, pop a disc in and take a trip down memory lane, just for old times sake ;)

Good System. But not without some flaws…
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2024Verified Purchase
When my PS1 arrived, let’s just say the box had seen better days. Firstly, the seller must’ve had an obsession with sticky tape. Secondly, The box looked like somebody dropped a freezer from a 4 story building. Anyway, The console itself look good aside from some dirt on the bottom. But the major flaw was that The Console DIDNT come with controllers (as of now. Theyre coming on Monday, hopefully), Hell. Not even a memory card! But then again that’s asking for a bit much. I had to improvise and use my PS2 controller on it to function the games. So yeah. If you’re looking for a childhood system, I recommend it. But probably get it in much better quality. (I was born in 05 so I never experienced it until now.)

Great phone for those getting away from smartphones
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2020Verified Purchase
I bought this phone to detox from the internet and get off my smartphone. Smartphones are excellent devices with almost everything you could ever want but I felt like I was addicted and wanted to reduce my usage. To put this review in perspective, my previous phone was an iPhone XS on the EE network. I ordered a replacement SIM for the new phone.I wanted a phone that had all the essentials, but didn't offer an ""easy"" way to browse the web or spend a huge amount on social media or any other apps. This phone so far is perfect for what I need. Here are some general points:- It is impossible to browse the web endlessly on this phone or spend time on social media. The browsing experience is really like the olden days where you have a tiny screen and typing takes forever. This is perfect. You cannot spend your day mindlessly on your phone. It is just too inconvenient to use daily, but useable enough for when you *really* need it in a pinch. The same applies to all the social media apps on it (e.g. Twitter/Facebook), you can't browse them easily- It supports bluetooth audio, so you can hook up modern bluetooth headsets to it and it will just work. I paired my phone with a Jabra Elite 65t headset and it worked without any hitches. So you can still walk around outside and listen to podcasts, audiobooks, or music. If you use your phone at the gym to listen to music, you can do it with this (you might get some funny looks for having a flip phone though)- It has Whatsapp and Google Maps. Two very essential apps for the modern age! I had both of them setup with no problems. Unfortunately, Whatsapp did not have desktop app support (you can't use Whatsapp Desktop to sync with your phone). Google maps was OK to use and has directions support, so it can take you along a route - walking or driving.- It has all the basic essentials, like a timer, a gallery, a still/video camera, calculator, e-mail, etc. Anything you would expect to be pre-installed on a phone.- It supports 4G, so data access will be really fast.- It has an app store with some additional good stuff. Things like to-do apps, notes, radio, etc. The selection is very limited though and there are not many ""official"" apps from big companies.Full list of ""big name"" apps: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Whatsapp, Google MapsI highly recommend this phone if you are trying to get away from smartphones but want to have all the essentials that you sort of need these days.

Turning back time
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 November 2022Verified Purchase
I’ve had an iPhone 8 since around the launch period and the battery life isn’t what it used to be. I have to take a battery pack to work and that means two devices to charge the night before. So, I decided to try going back to a feature phone rather than get a new iPhone or even a new battery.I wanted one which had a lot of the features of the iPhone that I use, which means Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, email, WhatsApp, web browser and a music player. This phone fits the bill.There’s no getting around the fact that going back to a feature phone is a huge compromise. Everything is slower and more cumbersome to do. But I evaluated my iPhone usage and as long as I can make or receive calls and listen to music on a Bluetooth headset I’m okay. On the rare occasions I need to use satnav I will put the SIM card back in the iPhone for the day.The plus points are the size of the device when it’s folded. It’s fairly thick but it has a small footprint, which is nice. It fits nicely in the palm and the volume buttons are easily accessible without taking it out of my pocket when listening to music. The battery life is also prodigious, if you obey some rules which I will get to soon, as they are a bit of a negative. I think the Nokia website says 20 days standby, which is amazing. Factor in actually using the device and it will drop, but if I can get a week out of it before needing to recharge it will change my life. And it has email, internet, WhatsApp and Google maps, so it doesn’t feel like you’re cut off from the outside world just because you have a feature phone. Overall, it does what it should well and gets you by with the other things.Now the negatives. The long battery life is only achievable if you have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth switched off. This obviously means you have to activate them before use. Compromise, remember? Another thing is how cumbersome a number pad is after using an iPhone for so long. I will get used to it but for now it’s a learning process. Bluetooth in the car is different too, because the phone doesn’t support phone book or call history downloading to the car, so to get a number in there I had to use the car’s voice dial and have the number appear in the car’s call history that way. I don’t know if it will still be there next time I use the car. But it’s no problem to use voice dial as there are only two people I would possibly call while driving. Most of the time they would call me.So far I’m enjoying the iPhone detox and by the time this phone needs replacing, who knows what fancy iPhone will be available?

Fantastic phone
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2020Verified Purchase
Like most people who buy this phone. I brought it to get away from years of having a smartphone. It got to the point when I needed a digital detox !. The trouble with smartphones is they tend to take over your life. You feel the need to keep checking stuff like a robot. This phone really is five stars in every department. Fantastic little phone. With all the essential apps you need like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc etc . The battery life is amazing. And as you don’t feel the need to keep checking it , the battery will easily get you through a full day without charging no problem. Slick design, light in the hand . So easy to use. 4g as well so speeds are good. So if you’re looking to get away from the smartphone syndrome this has to be the phone for you by far. Trust me , I have had them all , iPhones, Samsung, etc , but this little baby blows them all away. Get it through Amazon, fantastic service, quick delivery. Say goodbye to being a smartphone robot .

Totally overpriced, the bags are rubbish and always leaves debris in the cup, supposed to be peach flavoured but it tastes the way I imagine a lemon kitchen cleaner would- it certain smells like it!  I have been forcing this on myself for 5 days so far and wish I could just throw it away but at the price paid I’m stuck with it. :(

I’m still not sure about this one. I have one every morning but yet to notice any difference. I will give it more time to see if it does what they say. Some reviews said they noticed the change after 4 days, but I’ve been drinking it for ten days now and still nothing. It might work for some and not for others. Taste is nice though.

I was struggling with low energy and flaky skin around my mouth which I read can be a sign of low iron. I choose these iron tablets since I prefer supplements in a blister pack rather than a loose pot as they keep the product away from moisture and other external factors.These iron tablets aren't too large so they're easy to swallow and they feel gentle on the stomach. I feel like I have more energy and the dry skin has started to clear up so I'm happy with these.

Bar Keepers Friend Original Stain Remover Powder 250g - Cleans, restores and polishes - Shifts limes
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2024Verified Purchase
Review Summary:This product is a game-changer when it comes to cleaning and maintaining household items. It's a versatile cleaning agent that not only cleans but also restores and polishes a wide range of surfaces.Positive Features:1. The product's cleaning power is impressive. It effortlessly shifts limescale and soap scum, leaving surfaces spotless and shiny.2. The versatility of this product is commendable. It works on a wide range of surfaces, from kitchen countertops to bathroom tiles, making it a must-have in every household.3. The powder form is a plus as it allows for controlled usage. You can easily adjust the amount you use depending on the severity of the stain or dirt.4. The product also has a restorative function. It doesn't just clean, it also restores surfaces to their original state, making them look as good as new.Areas for Improvement:1. While the product is generally easy to use, it would be more user-friendly if it came with a more detailed instruction guide, especially for first-time users.2. The packaging could be improved. A more ergonomic design would make it easier to handle and dispense the product.3. The product could benefit from a more pleasant scent. While it doesn't have a strong or offensive odor, a fresh or clean scent would enhance the overall user experience.In conclusion, this product is a reliable and effective cleaning solution. Its ability to clean, restore, and polish a wide range of surfaces makes it a valuable addition to any home. Despite a few minor areas for improvement, its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks.

I bought this when my grandson outgrew his Moses basket!  Brilliant!  Quick to put up and easy to put down.  Have to admit at first I thought it was difficult to assemble but now I’m used to it!  Top tip pull all the sides up first and make sure they all lock in before pushing the base down.  When putting away make sure all the legs aren’t trapped so they roll up well in the base.  You will also need a mattress.  The one that comes with it is useless.  Very thin and very hard.  It’s brilliant with a separately bought mattress and I just store it in the wardrobe when not in use.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2024Colour Name: Sleep N Play Center, StarsVerified Purchase
We wanted a temporary bed due to my son outgrowing his moses basket and us not feeling ready for him to go in his main cot yet. We thought this was the best route to go due to it still being useful after this short period. This filled the gap and we used it for a month before we moved him into his own bedroom and main cot. We now leave it at my parents for them to use if he stays over. I was hesitant before it arrived on how the quality would be but in fairness this was a really good buy. It stores away compactly aswell. It can be abit tricky to put up before you get the hang of it and the button to release it abit stiff but it's well worth the price.TIP... when putting it up straighten and lock in the side bars first before the head and foot bars.

I think it's important to note most cameras sharing this cameras price range were all once upon a time extremely expensive. I am a student and even this was a huge investment for me but I am 110% happy with it. I recommend with the money left you purchase a good lens, its probably just as important as the camera itself. I had a budget and I 50/50 it with both the camera and lens. You don't need a professional level camera if you are still learning, a good photographer can make do with any camera. This was a good choice for me.There are many tutorials on how to use this camera online, it is extremely beginner friendly and it comes with an all be it standard lens.

There is a massive range of games available to play on the game and is suitable for all the family. The fun is endless. Its a game she will never get bored with too. Excellent value for money. The games are easy to explain and there are not too many instructions you have to read like most other games. I would recommend this game for all ages and both boys and girls.

Good all round fun
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 February 2012Verified Purchase
We were hoping for games that would keep most people involved most of the time and it does just that.  Where there are not enough people to make up numbers the computer adds a Mii, sometimes useful when trying not to pick on anyone in the room to nasty challenges or to lose out.  The only frustration is that it doesn't seem to cope with more than 4 competitors at a time and there's not much to do when everyone else has left you to it.All round good fun, enjoyed by all ages.

Excellent entertainment for one or many!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2012Verified Purchase
My children have had endless fun with this game. There are lots of different minigames, and a board game which involves minigames, ensuring no-one gets left behind as there's a good element of chance as well as skill. My son plays against the computer at stupid o'clock when he wakes up, and he, his sister and random neighbours teenagers all seem to be able to play together.  The only trouble is the volume, as they get so excited!  Make sure you have plenty of wii remotes though, as everyone will want to join in! And plenty of time, as several of the games take a long time to play (up to an hour for some, if you have 3 or 4 people playing!).  Definitely get this!

How did I live without this!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2010Verified Purchase
Bought this for a recent party, and it made a great impression. We played many of the mini games but the favourite was Hide the Wii remote! Can't remember when I've had so much fun playing games at a party. Some advice for places to hide the remote are on top of the CD rack, in the washing machine detergent drawer, inside a cushion cover, inside the light fitting. We had the maximum 4 Wii remotes for this which makes it much better but getting people out of the room in order to hide the remotes was the hardest part.There are many games included in Wii Party broken down into three sections depending on how many people you have playing and how long you wish to play each game. You can also play each of the 80+ mini games which can be as little as 2 minutes long. All depends on what you feel like. Would recommend having 4 Wii remotes though unless it's just you or you and one other (definitely 4 for 'hide the remote')

My 7 year old bought this with his Christmas money and what a good buy it was.  There are 5 of us in our family ranging from 7-43 and we all love playing this game.  Its especially great for our boys who have spent ages playing it and they all enjoy it even our 13 year old.  There is a longer 45 minute game, a bit like playing a board game or there are loads of quick games that can be played if you haven't got too long.

Hilarious, kid-friendly alternative to GTA
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2016Verified Purchase
I have fond memories of playing this with my brother as a kid. When my 7 year old stepson started asking if we would buy him the latest Grand Theft Auto (which was definitely not going to happen) I remembered this game and suggested it as an alternative. Like most kids he loves the Simpsons, so it was an easy sell, and he, his dad and I have had great fun playing it together. It's a hilarious parody of GTA but also stands alone as a game in its own right, and of course it's particularly enjoyable if you're a Simpsons fan.A quick note: this and other original Xbox games can be played on an Xbox 360 as long as you have a hard drive installed. If you don't have a hard drive already there are plenty available on Amazon at reasonable prices, and they're easy to install.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 August 2012Platform For Display: Xbox 360Edition: Standard EditionVerified Purchase
I am a huge fan of Infinity Ward's Call of Duty games and of Black Ops, however I have to say, now that Infinity Ward is gone so has all of the glamour and ingenuity of Modern Warfare.If you liked playing Modern Warfare 2, you will like this game, it has pretty much the same gameplay and graphics, a couple of new elements in the campaigns with the turret on wheels (sorry about the spoiler there), but it's no huge change. If you played the trilogy for their story then you will find it impressive but short. In terms of story you would still be better playing CoD 4: Modern Warfare 1.It has the same addictive multiplayer, with a couple of new guns, perks and gadgets but again, they should have brought more, ""Kill confirmed"" is an entertaining game mode, but it's not original as Halo had this a year earlier and I find their ""Headhunter"" mode is more entertaining - Please I don't want a ""CoD v Halo"" 1000 comment long trollers' rant after this review.All in all I can't fault it as a game itself as it is pretty damned good, but it's nothing you haven't seen before, well worth £20, not worth £40.

Single player campaign alone...
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2013Platform For Display: Xbox 360Edition: Standard EditionVerified Purchase
...is worth the asking price (provided you can get it cheap ;)).A seriously well-made game, with excellent visuals, great controls, a thirst for drama and a real satisfaction to the combat. Taking down enemies with accurate shooting is all the more pleasing on the highest skill level Veteran, where you take a more careful approach to the bullet-infested scenarios. Here you'll see yourself drop every few seconds if you don't consider these bullets realistically damaging, and it alters the pace of the game, increasing tension very nicely. Myself, I would've probably found it a touch too hard had I not played through once on Normal first, where you a) learn a little of the lay of the land, and b) really get your CoD legs on, as it were. After around 8hrs playing through the once, it left me wanting more, so I dived back in on Veteran level and wasn't disappointed.I can say nothing about multiplayer online, or even the Special Ops as I've never played them, but considering this game tends to sell *for* the multiplayer, you can expect that to be pretty good...... provided you don't feel it's too similar to previous releases... which it's bound to be given the premise. Even the single player, while set in different locations, and providing different level layouts and scenarios, is naturally very similar in feeling to the previous games. One does not buy Modern Warfare (or any of the Call of Duty games) without that in mind, surely.To sound off, it's a game you've seen before, but provided you want more of that, you'll enjoy it immensely.

The Call of Duty games are awful, with the exception of CoD 1/2/4.  But they are incredibly fun as long as you play with friends, whether you are racing towards a level or simply competing in the rounds for the best score with certain weapons.The community unfortunately is not like the community in CoD 1/2/4, the community used to be good.  But now it is all trick shot & little children screaming down the mics..this is not fun and that is why I have rated this game low for 'Fun'.  (The community now in CoD4 is rediculous too, as there are too many hackers but that's not the game's fault)I voted it 5 stars for overall because the concept of it is good, the killstreaks/deathstreaks are fine and the fact that you can play with friends easily is great.  I also love the face-off gametype. (2v2 | 3v3)

COD: MW 2.5?
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 June 2012Platform For Display: Xbox 360Edition: Standard EditionVerified Purchase
I'm not a die hard COD fan but I have played all of them so I've got a fair understanding of the history of COD.  MW 1 was a breath of fresh air in the FPS arena that was beyond saturated with World War 2 stuff.  MW2 was just as good in the campaign area if not for the poor multiplayer part that seemed to get hacked to death in the first 6 months of release.  Now I'm not going to point fingers because thats not what this is about but with the release of MW3 a lot of people including myself were hoping for a more polished multiplayer that couldn't succumb to 13 year old hackers and modders and believe me they are out there.  Do a Youtube search on it and you'll find loads.  But alas they did and it did and so far down the road the all mighty empire that is Infinity Ward don't seem to have done anything about it. Which is sad really because this was a series that for the first time that I know of the protagnist was not American (no offense but there are other countires wh speacial forces who are just as good if not better), the story line was good and the overall content was satisfying.  But it will always be mared by the poor multiplayer.

Just be glad its only a wasp and not a bee, which could kill you! There's no doubt that this works to heal up wasp sting. Funnily enough I noticed I had a wasp sting only days after I bought this though never actually noticed it at the time of the sting! I hardly ever get stings and was buying this to replace out-dated tube. Lucky I had it. But it says on label to discontinue if redness appears. I got redness after a couple of days. But its hard to tell if its the wasp sting that causes it or sunburn or sensitive skin. Mine cleared up before the cream treatment finished so probably nothing to worry about. The treatment is supposed to be only for 3 days but it probably takes about double that time to heal completely!

You can still see the mark but the redness and swelling has completely gone and it no longer itches.The tube comes will a foil seal that you can pop with the top of the screw on lid, the cream is smooth and off white in colour, and the tube I recieved has just over two years on it before expiry date.It also worked great on my daughters wasp sting so i find it useful to keep a tube of this in during the summer months at least.

Extremely good quality
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2023Style Name: Xbox | PCPattern Name: G29 | G920Verified Purchase
Had for about a year now. So I have alot to say, TL:DR at the bottom.The wheel is extremely good. While a little loud because of the vibration. Feels extremely premium, the pedals feels extremely good and so does the wheel. I have no issues about this thing holding up because how sturdy and premium it feels. The software is clean and is easy to use and navigate. You can use this on Xbox too but their isn't many games which support sadly. I used this mostly for truck simulators such as Euro and American where I clocked about 1000hrs on both using this wheel. It feels good. The force feedback while a little bit weak. Is extremely good for what I personally use it for. I can feel vibrations when I go over speed bumps and the resistance when turning. The only bad part is taking it apart and setting it up because it's a big bit of kit. It can frustrating and annoying which is why somtimes I leave it up and running. And additionally, the clutch is annoying to use because of how heavy the spring is so I changed for a lighter one.TL:DR: Premium feeling wheel, will hold up extremely well, only issue is the fact that the clutch is extremely hard to press and the set up process is a pain in the backside

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 January 2018Style Name: Xbox | PCPattern Name: G29 | G920Verified Purchase
Edit Jan 2019 - now almost 2 years down the line and still going strong. Also been using the shifter for a while so I'll add a short review of that at the endEdit Jan 2020 - now 3 years later and it's still working perfectly, not really run into any new issues that I can think of so still very much recommendedEdit September 2020 - After 3 and a half years, the potentiometer in the throttle has finally given out. However, if you have a soldering iron and a little experience this is pretty easy to fix, and the replacement part is pretty cheap. I honestly can't fault it too much though, potentiometers don't last forever and I used it a LOT in those 3 and a half years, and continue to use it after a fairly simple fix--------------I've held off on reviewing this because I wanted to give it a proper testing, and I've now been using this pretty heavily for a year (largely drifting on Assetto Corsa with some racing here and there, so it's gone through some pretty strenuous testing), and it's so far held up almost perfectly (more on that in a moment). I upgraded from a DFGT, and the FFB is a huge improvement from that, and having a clutch is a huge advantage. I would have liked a few more buttons though, the G29 is much more similar to the DFGT in terms of buttons but I chose this one because it looks less like a toy. Also, I really miss the stick shifter from the DFGT, it sucked as a shifter but it made a great hand brake so it would have been nice to see it return on this.The biggest problem I encountered is one I've seen a lot in the reviews, so it appears to be a fairly common fault, and that's that after a while the wheel started to develop a squeak when turning left. It was beyond the return period for Amazon however so I decided to just stick with it, it was irritating but the wheel still worked. HOWEVER, after a little while the squeak disappeared again, and it's now working perfectly, so my guess is it's just brand new bearings that needed to be broken in a little. If the problem comes back then I'll edit this, but so far so good.Another problem was the brake pedal. Some people despise the brake on this, saying it's impossible to use, and I'll admit that when I first got it I was basically unable to use the brakes because they were so stiff, I would press on it and my chair would just roll backwards. However, after some use (and jamming something behind the wheels of my chair, lol) the rubber bumper has softened up and I now don't have any real problems with it, I actually like the feel of it, because the amount of pressure required increases through the travel range you quickly learn to gauge how hard you need to press the pedal, rather than just how far, so it's a little more intuitive if you're used to real brakes (though it's important to note that it still doesn't feel like a real hydraulic brake pedal, it just behaves a little more like one than a simple sprung pedal). And if you don't like it, you can simply remove the rubber bumper and the pedals will be basically identical to the G27Another thing I noticed is that it does get a little hot when being used heavily. As I said earlier the main use it has seen has been drifting, which puts the motors under a lot more stress than usual, and I have noticed that the casing can start to become a little warm, though so far it hasn't caused any problems, I just let it cool down for a minute or so every now and then if it's being used heavily.Using it on Win 10 as well, I saw a few 1 star reviews saying it doesn't work on Win 10 but I assure you that it does, and has done flawlessly for the past year.All in all, while this wheel did have a few problems, I would probably still recommend it, you could buy a cheaper wheel but they're generally not worth it. Another decent alternative in the same price bracket is the Thrustmaster TMX Pro. Both are good choices (Edit - the TMX Pro is now pretty expensive compared to this)I also bought the shifter that you can get for this, and I have to say I'm pretty impressed with it for the price. It did initially feel a little flimsy, but after almost a year of use it still hasn't failed at all. The amount of force required is nothing compared to a real shifter, and you obviously can't feel when the gear doesn't engage properly (though that is a fault common to basically every shifter), so it doesn't feel entirely realistic, but it is so much more immersive using it, even if using the paddles is slightly faster it's worth it for the sense of really driving the car that it gives you. For the shifter alone I would probably also give it 4 stars, with the caveat that if you want as much realism as possible then this probably isn't for you since it does feel so light, so probably 2-3 stars for someone only concerned with realism

Sony service, with Sony service
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 June 2013Verified Purchase
Sony are a company who know how to do it right. They have been a special company for gaming for a long time, whether on a full sized console or the handheld.The PSP was a great little system, it brought the mainstream, heavier titles of gaming like Need for Speed, GTA and many many more to the small screen.My opinion of the PSP and now the PS Vita, have been that they were/are consoles for hardcore casual players. Someone who doesn't care too much about how or when or what they play but want to feel a bit of quality in their fingers. Which is in fact the reason I sold another great selling console to buy this one. Which I'm sure you know the name of. I wasn't feeling like I was getting my money's worth.First off, the Vita is very expensive. There is no denying. The console itself isn't too bad, but considering you will probably want a game or two, a case? Some screen protectors? Insurance if you are that sort of person. I spent £250 before it even arrived. And the fact this console requires a memory card to play. The proprietary cards Sony designed for this console are extortionate. They made them for the purpose of preventing piracy. That and just like many companies today they probably realised, they can do what they want and if people want a Vita (which understandably a lot of people do), they can charge what they want and people will still buy them. And they are correct. Doesn't mean we have to thank them for it.Without that card this system would be a much more reasonable price. That card sends it from reasonable considering this is a very nice console overall and you are getting your money's worth, to just a little bit too much.Anyway so I opened this thing up and had a quick leaf through the instructions etc. Nothing important there. And then I fired it up.The first thing I realised about this console is it is a bit smaller overall than it would appear in the images. Anyone who has held a PSP for any length of time probably will feel that this console is quite a deal smaller than the previous PSP. But the problem is it has gone from being a slim console to being borderline anorexic unfortunately. For anyone with small hands this is probably decent. I don't have small hands but I don't have massive hands and this console feels too small. I don't know what the obsession with making things smaller for the sake of it is. Especially in cases like this where they appear to do it without any regard for comfort. This console is more comfortable I believe for long periods than the 3DS or DS Lite. Those consoles are even smaller and you know it after playing. This isn't too bad but it could be better.The dual analogue sticks is a definite plus. Now you have the control of a dual shock on a handheld. They are sensitive. Light and very effective. I love them. If there is any negative and it is that they fall into the same dual shock pit fall. The left analogue stick isn't high enough up the controller to be totally comfortable. It feels like you are having to force you thumb down to reach it and considering that is the analogue stick that is the business end of most games, camera, movement, aiming etc. it really shows and the ONLY discomfort I've felt since playing this handheld is in my left thumb from this slightly unnatural positioning.On the back of the Vita there is a touch pad. The touch pad is a good idea, and I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunity to use it in future games. It is a shiny panel, it does look matte in the picture but I can assure you it is glossy. I've used it in a few games and it does work nicely. Feels a little unnatural at first but you get used to it after a while.Second I think it is time for a handheld to try and go entirely the dual shock route. If there is one thing that full sized consoles do well overall is the controllers. They have the art of putting as much controls into easy to use button mapping down to a science. It is time PS put their R2,L2,R3,L3 buttons on their handhelds. And made the handhelds just as comfortable.The console feels very solid. The buttons are crisp and easy to use. The touch screen and back panel are fantastic things. The screen itself is very nice resolution and is the perfect size as far as I can see. Any larger and it would be too heavy, any smaller and it wouldn't be big enough.The user interface on starting this up is an improvement over the previous and the PS3 interface if you ask me. Fully utilises the touch functions and is very well designed and smooth.The battery life on this console is pretty poor overall. With blu-tooth, wireless on and brightness on full this console lasts probably an hour and half. Turn all of these things off or onto minimum though and you can tease out a good three-four hours. I haven't officially timed it or anything but that is about what it feels like. But as this is common with most electrical devices today it isn't a major problem overall. I mean if you are out and about, blu-tooth and wifi are not going to be the top of your priorities list and the brightness is more than enough on minimum to see in pretty much any light so can't be accused of forcing you to waste your precious power.Form factor is important but user interface is less so (as long as it works, which it does). The reason I moved from 3DS to Sony was because I was sick of owning a console I wasn't using. Games on a console are total preference and opinion. It is my opinion that I hate most of the games on 3DS. They are all half arsed ports that look pretty terrible overall, or they are childish enough to make me think twice. That is why I moved to PS Vita, I saw plenty of games I felt I would play.PSN is the future of games in my opinion and Xbox Marketplace/Steam on PC as well. Many people like their physical games but I am sick of trying to find room for disk boxes on my shelves. Digital only games, will come sooner or later, but it will most likely be sooner than you think.PSN holds every game on the PS Vita, there are plenty of them though the list isn't all that long. But of the games on it, there are a lot of high quality, battle hardened titles on it that everyone remembers from the PS1/X days. Mortal Combat, Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3, those sorts.Then you have the PSP game catalogue. The PS Vita uses SD cards to play it's games. The old UMD days are over, and it couldn't have happened sooner. No more whiring noises coming from the device, no more ugly UMD drive thing popping open on the back. If you have a large PSP stack at home, KEEP YOUR OLD PSP. The PSP UMDs are not backwards compatible with Vita. As it stands there is no way of playing your UMDs that you own on Vita. But a massive selection of PSP games are available on PSN to download. You will have to buy them again though. Luckily they aren't that expensive overall. I haven't seen one for over £10.And finally one of the best parts about owning a PSP or Vita, is the fact PSN has a selection of ported PS1 games. Silent Hill 1, Resident Evil 1, 2 and 3, Medieval, Crash Bandicoot, all of those old gems can now be bought at reasonable price online, downloaded and played anywhere you have your Vita. And if that isn't a great reason to own a Vita alone I don't know what is.The games list on Vita is expanding, slowly but surely it is getting there. Just last week Jack and Daxter, Jak II and Jak III were made for Vita, E3 2013 revealed a number of nice looking games coming along.Then finally the party piece of the Vita. PS4 is engineered at an architecture level, which is a load of circuit boards and wires to most of us, to be compatible for the Vita. Now what that means is, you can use the Vita on PS4 games that allow it as a second screen, much like the Wii U does now. But best of all you can play your PS4 games on the Vita. Yes that is correct, though not in the sense you might expect.The PS3 can use what is called ""Remote Play"" on Vita right now. Except the PS3 wasn't designed to use it on purpose. The PS4 on the other hand is, so while on PS3 there is probably 20 really crappy games that can use the feature Sony have told us ALL PS4 games will be compatible for Vita EXCEPT the games that are designed to use the Playstation Eye.So what this does is as follows, you connect up your PS Vita to your PS4 using a similar method to linking two phones via blu-tooth. You give a pin to both parties and all people using the pin can connect up. So the PS4 starts up, and starts up a game, the game uses the PS4's hardware to run the game, the PS4 then converts all of the game footage into video, and transmits it wirelessly to the Vita. You control the game using the Vita controls which sends your inputs to the PS4, the PS4 does its thing then sends the result back to the Vita, so in essence you are playing your PS4 game, on your Vita and viewing it by video.The magic to this comes in the form of something called Gaikai. Gaikai is a game streaming service which Sony have bought. Gaikai is a name to sell this process to the public, what Gaikai really is is a bunch of servers. The same way Amazon has a server/s, which we all log into to buy our stuff, Sony have these servers which are used to push game footage to the Vita. The absolute specifics in this are where my knowledge runs out, but what it does mean is the process I described above for playing your PS4 games on Vita, can be done anywhere in the world where there is an internet connection. So out at a friends house? Play your PS4 on Vita. Having lunch at work or taking a break? Fire up your PS4 at home from your Vita. At the airport waiting for a two hour delayed flight? Play some PS4.In theory this is what Sony are going for, in practice though there will be some issues. The main one being you will probably need fibre optic connection to pull it off seamlessly. Ever been watching a youtube video and it just buffers over and over and over? Yeah me too, well that is what is going to happen in a way on your game if you don't have exquisite internet speed. But don't be alarmed you don't need to use Gaikai to use the remote play. Gaikai will be needed if you want to use it a long distance from the console. I mean why would you use the remote play if you have the PS4 near you? Well most won't but I personally probably will at some point.Luckily this is still early days, it may not be as bad as it probably is at the moment.A cherry to that cake is though, that Gaikai has been rumoured to allow you to play the entire back catalogue of PS3 titles. This will work on PS4 and on Vita. So in essence the PS Vita not only has its own selection of games, it has the PSP catalogue, the PS1 classics collection, the majority of the PS4 games provided you own a PS4, and the entire PS3 catalogue as well. Gaikai is supposed to be up and running in 2014. Lets hope they don't change their minds!So to summarise, this console is fantastic, it is reasonably comfortable despite a few issues. The console is top quality, it is easy to use, it has an astounding range of features that can be used by game developers. And the games catalogue isn't too shabby either. To top that off Sony have announces some beefy plans for this system in years to come.It may be expensive but Sony sure make you feel like you have made the right choice.If you want to know whether it is worth it for you, have a look at the games available, on here and on the Playstation Store, then ask yourself if you can see yourself playing those games. That is what I did and I am so happy with the purchase.

It's not perfect, but it's as close as you're going to get in a handheld console.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2012Verified Purchase
I know because of who makes it, the Vita is never going to be given a fair go by some and that is a genuine shame, as this handheld is incredibly impressive.  It delivers a massive amount of technical horsepower that nearly puts it on equal footing with HD home consoles, a rich, diverse feature set and an easy to use dual stick design which handheld consoles have been crying out for for many years now.  It is an exceptional piece of kit... but it isn't without it's flaws... not the least of which is the expensive price tag (Even though it has dropped significantly in price since it first went up for pre-order).First, the design of the console...  which is perhaps a tad on the ""long"" side (Though this is understandable given the huge screen it has I guess) in addition to being fairly heavy for something this size (Along similar lines to how the very first PSP was I'd say)and as a result it can feel a bit big in the hands initially, but once you manage to adjust to it, it feels very comfortable to use, with the buttons and screen all placed in fairly tight proximity to allow for easy switching from analogue sticks to buttons to touch screen on the fly.  It's a layout that works very well for what it needs to do, though there is perhaps a complaint to be made about how small and fiddly the analogue sticks can feel.  Also, I'd strongly recommend you get both a wrist strap and a screen protector for safety before you even touch the thing.  The screen can smudge quite easily when you're touching it and switching around control methods leaves open the danger of dropping it.  Better safe than sorry.  It's a great design overall, if not a perfect one, but it does what it needs to and that's the main thing I suppose.  The covering tab for the cartridge slot isn't much fun to open if you don't have long nails either, and the actual game cartridges themselves are ridiculously tiny.  I could see them being very easy to misplace or lose if you aren't careful.Second, the console's features, which is where it shines brightest.  The feature set on offer here is pretty amazing, with a variety of control options to draw on besides the standard buttons and thumb sticks.  The touch screen is particularly impressive in just how responsive it is.  Most of my experience of touch screens up to now has been through the various Nintendo DS consoles, so what the Vita does could be the norm for smartphones and the like, but I gotta tell you this is worlds apart from the comparatively simple jabbing at the lower screen of the DS with a stylus.  The home menu demonstrates this nicely with a completely touch navigated set up of ""Apps"" (Called the ""Live Area"") that responds quickly and smoothly to the slightest touch and so far the in-game implementations have impressed, with Uncharted for example, letting you do such things as ""draw"" a path along handholds on walls for Drake to follow rather than navigate him manually with the sticks, and carvings you can take charcoal rubbings of, where you actually 'rub' the screen to create the rubbing.  It works beautifully.  The rear touch pad is perhaps a slightly less impressive feature so far, but there is some clever implementation of it in some games, such as Uncharted again, where sliding your finger up and down the rear pad can be used to adjust zoom levels on sniper rifles and cameras very easily and Stardust Delta has a mini game where you have to 'crush' asteroids between your thumb and finger using the touch screen and rear pad simultaneously.  Clever, but thus far it's more a novelty than a genuinely essential control element.  There is also a gyroscope built in for 'tilt' nonsense in games that to be honest seems just as annoying as it did on the 3DS.  It's not a feature I'm a fan of in general.  Hardware features aside, the software features (Sorry... ""Apps""), have some really nice functions as well, including cross game/party chat, which is a feature people apparently wanted very badly on the PS3 for whatever reasons.  It seems to work very well as far as I can see.  There are standard features such as the media players for videos and music and a web browser (That doesn't have flash support yet, so no Youtube for you!) in addition to a console tutorial/mini game collection called 'Welcome Park', which walks you through the various features of the Vita and then sets you challenges in using them in order to earn trophies, which are catalogued in the efficiently laid out trophies app, which gives you the option of viewing either your Vita earned trophies only or a full collection of all your trophies earned on Vita and PS3 combined into one big list.  Sadly you can't as yet view Vita trophies using your PS3, but your PSN ID card does keep tracked of Vita trophies thankfully, once you've synched both consoles up to the network of course.  Synching your trophies by the way is considerably faster on Vita than on PS3 (Has yet to take longer than 5 seconds or so when I synch them on it), and it synchs them automatically whenever you launch the trophy app, handily.  The system also lets you use custom soundtracks on any game, manage your PS3 friends list and associated messages, take pictures with the front or rear cameras, and also remotely access your PS3 via wifi or ad hoc, which works much better than the same feature on the PSP, but still doesn't allow you to play PS3 games via the handheld... yet.  An interesting app I thought was the 'Near' app, which uses the network to scan for other Vita users in your area and provides data on what they are playing, which games are proving most popular and what the players think of those games demonstrated using emoticons and pie charts.  It's an interesting tool that has seen me inundated with friend requests from people who live nearby (who presumably found me using Near themselves) and the 'gifting' function that many Vita games incorporate utilising Near (That sees you receive content for games like extra missions, challenges, collectibles and such from other users as you 'find' them via Near).  I could see comparisons being drawn with the 3DS' Streetpass and Mii features, but the way in which the two function is very different (eg, You can't set your Vita to exchange information with other Vita owners you'd pass in the street), but that's still probably the closest comparison I could offer for it.  Lastly, I'd like to make mention of the way the Vita keeps track of the progress people on your friends list make through games and gives you a breakdown of the milestones they've hit in those games.  For example, I was starting Wipeout 2048 after trying it out on launch day and when I touched the 'app tab' for the game on the Live Area, it brought up a series of chronologically ordered boxes showing my ID beside pictures of trophies earned for that game and such info as ""achieved a time of 1m 45s on course X"" (Not a real course btw, just an example) along with boxes showing people on my friends lists' trophies and times for various courses and how they compare to my own.  It is basically like Need for Speed Hot Pursuit's superb Autolog feature... but for every game (Every game I've played so far at least).  There are other features, but I'd be here all day covering them all.  Suffice to say, on the features front, this console is a beast.The technical prowess of the machine is well known as being equally impressive, but trust me, it's only when you see the scale and level of detail on display in titles like Uncharted that you really appreciate just how much grunt the Vita has.  True, you can see how it doesn't quite match up to the visuals of the PS3, but it's pretty damn close... so close that it almost doesn't matter.  The quality obviously varies from game to game, but given just how impressive so many of the games available for it on day one are, it's going to be a sight to see what sort of games start appearing once the hardware has been properly mastered by developers.  It's a powerful piece of hardware and no mistake.Speaking of the games, it seriously cannot be overstated how exceptional a software line up the Vita's launch games are.  There are some truly excellent titles available, with the highlights for me personally being Uncharted, Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Wipeout and Ninja Gaiden, in addition to superb downloadable titles like Stardust Delta and Motorstorm RC (Which are both very cheap to purchase as well).  I've bought 8 games for it already, and can see at least 4 more I want to get just from the launch games alone.  I don't want to labour console comparison nonsense here, but in all honesty, I'd rate the Vita's first day games line up higher than the 3DS' first YEAR games line up, as in almost a year of ownership of the 3DS, I have bought a grand total of 9 games, with nothing else interesting me yet released.  I'm not a fan of fanboy baiting crap like this, but considering we're talking about new handheld hardware, comparisons between the two machines are inevitable, despite how different what they both offer is.  There is, however, a point to be made about how the Vita's short term release schedule is fairly sparse for the rest of the year, with only about 2 games a month showing on most release calendars.  Likely this will change come E3 and it's announcements, but for the moment things could be a tad more... ""populated""... on the games front, especially in comparison to the 3DS, which is finally hitting it's stride in the coming months from the looks of it.Chances are you'll have made up your mind about the Vita already based off of disproportionately negative coverage from some sectors of the media that's more about grinding an axe with Sony than it is how the Vita itself shapes up and of course the reports of poor sales of the thing don't really help it's case, but seriously, if you haven't already, go to your nearest HMV or somewhere and try out a demo model of the console for yourself and I think you'll be very surprised by just how well it works and how impressive the games actually look running on it in your hands.  Every person I've let use my console so far has been deeply impressed with it despite none having any real interest in it prior... leading me to believe the only thing that's going to make up anyone's mind for sure about the Vita is actually trying one yourself.  If it still does nothing for you at that point... hey, at least you gave it a shot... but I daresay most will find themselves surprised by how much they like the look of it.  And yes, I'm aware I'm saying reviews such as this one are essentially useless here if trying the machine first hand is the only way to make up your mind about it, but it's the truth.  I can harp on about how much I love it all day, but why should you listen to me when the only opinion you should trust is your own?  For my part though, despite some minor issues with the design and a price tag that could perhaps be described as a bit high, I think this console is exceptional.  There is a lot to love here, and while you'll probably be bombarded with negativity about it from certain sources, I have no hesitation in saying that most of what you'll be hearing/reading about it is total crap.  I think it's well worth the sub £200 price tags that are now more or less the standard for it.  Maybe it won't last, I'm not in a position to judge that, but while it does I'm going to enjoy it.Try it out.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2024Flavour Name: Baileys Original (Liqueur)Size Name: 1 LVerified Purchase
For me, Baileys Original Irish Cream Liqueur is more than just a drink; it's a delightful tradition and a nostalgic journey. This iconic Irish creation has been a cherished part of my life for years, and it never fails to bring a smile to my face. Here's why I hold it close to my heart.Baileys is the result of Irish craftsmanship at its finest. It took four years of dedication to perfect this exquisite blend. What sets it apart is the heavenly combination of smooth cream and the warmth of whiskey, all wrapped in a velvety texture. It's like a comforting hug in a glass.When it comes to tasting notes, Baileys delivers an exceptional experience. The sweet harmony of fine Irish whiskey and creamy Irish dairy is a true delight. Rich chocolate and subtle hints of vanilla come together to create a symphony of flavors that dance on your palate.Now, the beauty of Baileys lies in its versatility. While it's perfect on its own, served over ice for that touch of sophistication, I've discovered a few personal favorites. Drizzling Baileys over a scoop of ice cream transforms a regular dessert into an extraordinary treat. And for those mornings that need a bit of magic, a splash of Baileys in my coffee is the perfect way to start the day.In my book, Baileys Original Irish Cream Liqueur deserves nothing less than a five-star rating. It's not just a drink; it's a cherished companion that adds a touch of Irish warmth to every moment. So, here's to Baileys, a timeless classic that holds a special place in my heart. 🥃🍀

Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur: Creamy Delight with a Few Caveats
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 June 2023Verified Purchase
Rating: 4 out of 5 starsBaileys Irish Cream Liqueur, a classic choice for those seeking a smooth and indulgent drink, offers a delightful taste experience. While it boasts several positive qualities, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. Here's an overview of the good and bad aspects of Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur:Pros:Rich and Creamy Flavor: Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur delivers a rich, velvety taste that combines the sweetness of Irish whiskey with the smoothness of fresh dairy cream. The creamy texture and delightful blend of flavors make it an enjoyable and luxurious treat for many palates.Versatile Usage: One of the key advantages of Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur is its versatility. It can be enjoyed on its own, over ice, or incorporated into various cocktails and desserts. The possibilities are endless, making it a versatile choice for social gatherings or personal indulgence.Widely Available: Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur is a popular and widely available brand, making it easily accessible at most liquor stores, supermarkets, and online retailers. This availability ensures that you can enjoy this liqueur without much difficulty, regardless of your location.Attractive Packaging: The packaging of Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur is both aesthetically pleasing and functional. The iconic, curved bottle design with its classic label adds a touch of elegance to any home bar or drinks cabinet. The sturdy bottle also helps preserve the quality of the liqueur.Cons:High Sugar Content: As a sweet liqueur, Baileys Irish Cream contains a significant amount of sugar. While this contributes to its delicious taste, it may be a drawback for individuals who prefer less sugary beverages or those with dietary restrictions. Moderation is key when enjoying this liqueur.Limited Shelf Life: Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur has a relatively short shelf life compared to other spirits. Once opened, it is recommended to consume the bottle within six months for optimal taste and freshness. This limited longevity can be a drawback for occasional drinkers or those who prefer to savor their liqueur over an extended period.Not Suitable for Lactose Intolerant Individuals: Due to its primary ingredient being dairy cream, Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur is not suitable for individuals with lactose intolerance or dairy allergies. Those with dietary restrictions should consider alternative options.Price Point: Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur is generally priced at a premium compared to some other liqueurs on the market. While the quality and taste justify the cost for many consumers, those on a tighter budget might find it to be a less frequent indulgence.In summary, Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur offers a rich and creamy taste experience that can be enjoyed in various ways. Its versatility, wide availability, and attractive packaging are notable advantages. However, the high sugar content, limited shelf life, and potential exclusion for lactose intolerant individuals may pose challenges for some consumers. If you have a sweet tooth and enjoy indulgent liqueurs, Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur is definitely worth a try, though it may be best enjoyed in moderation to fully appreciate its unique flavors.

Loads of fun. Easy to use. Child friendly.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2016Verified Purchase
Played by 6x 40 somethings and 7 kids 7-13 yrs for a New Years Eve dinner. Played it straight from the box - no preparation, invites etc. This let the kids choose everyone's characters live at the table, which was fun. Don't be phased by the 18+ designation. Pretty tame and oblique innuendo that mostly went over the kids heads, and what did not was pretty harmless. No worse than what they would probably have heard anyway. We themed the evening as 1966 Nassau jazz club to get a more fun dresscode and playlists, then wrote our own story link tying the jazz club to the nearby colonial governor's residence, The Manor. Worked fine. The murderer is chosen at random at the start of the game and can be any of the characters. Everyone put on funny accents. We didn't use the CD. Great fun and the murder unmasked themselves at 23.59. Perfect timing. We will reuse this game lots.[Here's the link to the jazz club if you want to recycle it  - most facts from wikipedia - find the Eddie Harris track on spotify]It’s a hot and humid New Years Eve at the Calypso Horn jazz club in downtown Nassau, 1966. The anticipation of the Junkanoo celebrations, starting an hour after midnight, tides the crowd over the disappointment that the main act, the US sensation of 1966, Alabama’s finest son, Percy Sledge, will not be performing tonight. Along with a number of other American artists planning to see in the New Year in Nassau, Sledge’s flight was cancelled due to bad weather over the Florida keys.The support act, Gladys Bright and the Mango Pips, extend their repertoire one improvisation further. Eddie Harris, one of the US artists who made the trip before the storm broke, lifts the crowds with his own jazz sax version of Percy Sledge’s latest hit, which the local Bahamas DJ’s had been overplaying since its release in April that year. [play track].Sir Roland Theodore Symonette approaches tentatively from the Baillou Hill Street side of the club. He has mixed feelings about crossing to this side of town, and to this particular venue, on this particular night. The British Governor was enjoying his looser ties with London over the last few years, but felt his free-wheeling days of autonomous governance might be numbered. The Progressive Liberal Party was building up quite a head of steam under Lydon Pindling, the leading contender to become Nassau’s first non-white Governor. Sir Roland didn’t want to give these amateurs any unneeded ammunition for their electoral campaign. He was less worried for himself, but more for his houseguests Lord Heathcliff and his shrieking fiancée Naomi. Frightfully arriviste, they had neither tone nor manners, and it was much to Sir Roland’s chagrin that he has agreed to accompany them to the Calypso Horn so early on New Year’s Eve, with so much that could go awry.Lord Heathcliff was clearly tiring of the jazz club already. Maybe the music was too avante-garde even for his tastes. He proposed to Sir Roland that some of the new friends they had made at the bar should return to the Governor’s residence, known locally as The Manor, to enjoy a traditional colonial dinner, cooked by the inimitable Blanche Batter, before returning to the Calypso Horn for the Junkanoo festivities in the earliest hours of 1967.Sir Roland’s relief was palpable. As the party sucked the last drips of rum from the ice of their cocktails, he almost came to appreciate Eddie Harris’ sax cover of the Percy Sledge hit of the year that he sheepishly had had to admit to never having heard until tonight. Everything now would be fine. What could possibly go wrong….

Great fun, very easily adapted to numbers and no shows  and don't be put off by the 18yrs+
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2017Verified Purchase
We needed a theme for our annual birthday get together that involved kids from 9 to 17.  Having hosted lots of the more structured murder mystery parties I was a bit apprehensive about how the flexi party would work.  I had read all of the reviews regarding the 'adult' content as the 18+ warning concerned me a little.  I really need not have worried.  It was all very panto-like.  That is, if you understood the double-entendres then it was saucy and if you were too young to understand it then it was fine.  There was absolutely nothing explicit in there which was a relief.  The murderer was selected on the day and it is all down to the scripts so if you are the murderer you read the guilty and answers and everyone else reads the innocent answers.  It all makes perfect sense.  We had the full quota of 14 and it went off without a hitch.  The kids and adults loved to dress up and the characters were really specific.  There are invitations and a question menu each with questions to be asked to every character which can be amended if you have fewer guests.  My only big complaint,  which is why I gave only 4 stars, is that on the invites you get only a name and a costume suggestion.  The invitation doesn't say exactly who your character is  (eg the Housekeeper)and I had to keep referring back to the Amazon website to find out who everyone was.  This could easily be amended by having a page in the Hosts's guide to list everyone's name and their role and to include the roles on the invites as I had to text everyone to say what role they had.  Just saying the you are Em Fatale doesn't tell you that you are the widow of the murdered man and that would have been really useful to everyone.Other than that a great game.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 December 2015Verified Purchase
Played this with my family for Christmas as wanted to have everyone over beforehand as not seeing some of them until a few days after. Played this with 10 people and it worked really well. Everyone was really into the dressing up and there were many fantastic costumes. I have hosted one murder mystery before and really struggled to work out how to play it as it was pre-determined who the killer was so I didn't want to look at my character booklet and spoil it. For this game, as there is no pre-determined murderer,  I could read my bio and work out what would happen when. It was hard to judge how long the acts would take (was doing a sit down meal), act one only took around 10 minutes.Overall it was very easy to follow, and it didn't matter which characters were there as you could just explain that some had had to leave before the murder so couldn't be guilty. We used the audio and so it did reference the other characters who weren't there, this was a little confusing but it was interesting listening to their reasons, it did make us want to hear more though and so it was a shame they weren't there.

Played this game with a party of 10 and we had a blast! The list of characters to choose from were brilliant and the costume ideas were really helpful! The game was easy to follow and well scripted, also allowing for some ad-lib if that’s the sort of thing you like to do. I really like that the murderer gets chosen on the night so everyone could be guilty and it means you can play again. I’d say the only issue was the cd it came with as we didn’t have anything to play it on, would be more up to date to provide a YouTube link or a downloadable app to play off a phone etc. It wasn’t a big deal though as someone simply reads aloud the narration sections. All in all a great game and not at all stressful for the host to plan 👍

Lives up to the hype!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 December 2013Verified Purchase
I've had this since UK launch day and it's proving to be an awesome console.It's a lovely shape; slightly smaller than the pictures suggest (in my opinion), and looks modern, in half gloss/half matt finish separated by a thin strand of light running through the top (or side, if stood vertically).  It's so good looking, in fact, that it niggles even more that they still have not put USB ports at the BACK of the playstation, so the view is spoiled somewhat by the wires hanging out the two at the front.  If only they could have squeezed an additional four at the back...It also runs very quietly; I'd gotten so used to the hairdryer that was my PS3's cooling fan that the virtual ambient silence comes as a very pleasant factor (especially to the other half)Well that's the exterior.  More importantly - operation.  Well it's fast, and the next gen games that take advantage of its power are breathtakingly brilliant.  There's some free games available on the PS store to PS+ members (which will be anyone wanting to play online anyway).  I've played Resogun which is a side-scrolling shooter akin to the old ""Defender"" arcade game of the 80's, brought up to date.  The PS3 was already so capable in full HD, but it's really the high framerate (when so much is going on) that makes it stand out as a new generation.  This is perhaps more apparent on the proper third party titles.  Playing Battlefield 4 for the first time, I had a jaw-dropping moment.  I was playing multiplayer on a little pacific island archipelago, when suddenly the weather turned, it went dark and rainy, and the waves started battering the beaches.  Water, fire, smoke - that can be the tricky stuff for GPUs but on here it looks incredible.  It's so immersive, and all thanks to the power of the next-gen console.Storage-wise you are given 500Gb (less OS), which isn't huge (considering game and HD movie sizes), but should give the majority of owners plenty of time before it becomes an issue.  I'm quite pleased to know, however, that the drive is easily upgradable, and by the time you need to do so, a major upgrade will be very affordable (even SSD, which will not only add space but also improve performance in boot and load times).Controllers have also undergone an upgrade - and a more significant one than the Dualshock 2 -> Dualshock 3.  They feel more comfortable and ergonomic, especially after a long gaming session whereas on the older consoles I'd have started getting a bit of cramp (and the triggers are better designed).  They come with inbuilt speaker, and headset jack, and they have a new touchpad control (which I must say I've not yet seen used to much effect other than like an additional D-pad).  There's now a ""Share"" button, which allows you to upload a screenshot or video snippet of your latest bicycle kick wonder-goal or 500m sniper shot.  Last of note is a lightbar at the front which is used, like the touchpad, for some gimmicky things so far - hopefully some potential can be realised with this.  With the camera (separate purchase) it can be used to track who's holding what controller, and used in conjuction with facial recognition - this is neat, if a little ""show-off"".  It is, however, surprisingly reliable.  Again, I'd like to see the camera used to better potential - at the moment it's not doing anything particularly impressive.I have to say I don't quite get the same battery life out of the Dualshock 4 as I did out of the DS3, but I can't say for sure - it's just a gut feel, given that I've got 3 controllers and cycle through them quite a bit.The OS GUI is neat enough - I find it's not unlike the X-media-bar, but now with two levels - one horizontal with your day-to-day easy-access stuff, and another horizontal with the deeper and ""behind-the-scenes"" options... if that makes sense.  And naturally the whole visual aspect is improved.  It's intuitive, and puts contextual information in front of you - like for example recent game achievements from not only you, but also your friends.Video/TV on demand are slick, HD, and of decent performance, are now just as feasible an option to watch via Playstation as previously on Sky or Smart TV.One last feature of note - you can put the PS4 into standby, as well as completely powered off.  Interestingly, this appears to have little effect on ""wake-up time"" (I've found it to be about 30 seconds in both cases) but what's useful is that you can maintain power to the USB ports while in standby - so you can leave your dualshocks charging.  (NB - You need to set the option to enable this)As they did with the PS3 I have no doubt that capabilities will be continuously added through updates, and this console is going to get better and better.In conclusion - this is without doubt a recommended purchase

PS4 - Truly great!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2013Verified Purchase
I got my PS4 Bundle with the camera, Killzone and two controllers on release day at 11 a.m. and I set it up at 4 that afternoon.  It took less than 5 minutes to connect the console up to my Onkyo receiver and I used a new HDMI cable I bought from Amazon as I found the one enclosed slightly short for where I wanted to place the PS4.  After switching it on, the software updated itself to ver. 1.51 and setup was a breeze.  The operating system is real fast and PS3 users will be pleasantly surprised by just how much faster it is now when compared to PS3.  I then tried for an hour to sign on PSN but I suspect it was so busy with Day One purchasers it took a bit of time.  I just kept coming back every fifteen minutes while playing Call of Duty: Ghosts and eventually, I was able to sign-on and resume my PlayStation Plus membership I took out in June on the PS3.  I was able to download Resogun, Warframe and a couple more games and I then got on with gaming away for the rest of the evening and all night until 4 this morning!  By the way if you have a decent broadband connection, even the wireless is fast.The console looks good, harking back to the PS2 in some ways and is very light compared to the original fatboy PS3.  However, the build quality appears excellent and the size is surprisingly compact.  The console looks 'designed' and by this I mean that it feels to me a great deal of thought went into how it should look.  It certainly is very modern but it is also attractive and eye-catching.  It isn't just another box like my receiver or my dvd or  blu-ray players although not as formidable.  The disc slot is harder to see and the Eject and Power buttons are narrow and thin but require just a slight touch.  The console, remarkably, is not generating anything like the heat the PS3 did and was not too hot even after 10 straight hours of gaming (ahem!) due to those really large vents on the back.  I am amazed that Sony managed to integrate the power supply within the case considering how small it is compared to the previous PS3 and Xbox One, especially when it is supposed to be more powerful.  It all suggests that a great deal of time went not only into the design but also into ensuring that the PS4 runs cooler, quieter and more efficiently than any console before.  The console is not at all noisy and seemed whisper quiet to me, something I did really appreciate last night.  The Dualshock 4 is excellent and in my opinion the best controller out there at the moment.  It feels good, slightly larger than the 3rd version but appeared more finished.  The response is as one would want and within an hour it was like I had been playing with it all my life.  I like the new functions and even though the ear-piece supplied is basic, one can use a better one instead and it is a really useful inclusion nevertheless.Yes, there are few AAA games available at the moment but there are at least six such games out now that you can enjoy on the PS4 and more are on the way, from Sony, second and third party studios and independents.  By next summer there will be many games out and in the interim enjoy both your PS4 and PS3!  There are still many games being released on the PS3 and more to come so don't abandon it yet!.  I personally have six major releases I want to catch up on so far.If you area PS3 user, I can assure you that you will appreciate the PS4 even more and there is just no reason not to purchase it if you can afford it.

These have been the most accurate early results tests I've tried and having been pregnant many times I've tried a lot of tests. Sadly all but one of those pregnancies were not meant to be however am blessed to have one beautiful child (thanks to some amazing NHS doctors). But that's another story.Each time I suspected I had fallen pregnant  these First Response Early Result tests were the ones that consistently gave me accurate results and the earliest positive results so they're now the ones I go to first.The box doesn't state the sensitivity level but a bit of research tells me these detect lower HCG levels than most other available tests which is why you can test from six days before your period is due.My periods are not exactly like clockwork so its difficult to say exactly how many days early I have had a positive result but I've certainly had a positive before I expected to start. These tests have also given me positive results when the doctors urine test was negative and blood tests have confirmed that the First Response test was indeed correct.I know that when you're hoping to get that positive result, that waiting to test until your period is due can seem like an eternity but there is one thing to bear in mind with very early response tests of any brand and it's something I know well from experience.Occasionally you may get the big fat positive you've been hoping for and suddenly you're on cloud nine only to be devastated a week later when your period arrives. I have had this happen to me. I got a very early positive result (on more than one occasion too) and blood tests confirmed the pregnancies. But a week or two later what seemed like a period but was in fact very early miscarriage would start. The emotional rollercoaster this causes can be very upsetting so it's worth bearing this in mind if you are determined to test early.Had I not been under the care of doctors for repeated miscarriage and had these pregnancies confirmed by blood tests I may well have just assumed the tests had given me false positive results as many reviews have claimed these tests to have done, when in fact I have never had a false positive from one of these tests. I'm not saying that other people have not had false positives but it's not been the case for me.Anyway, you get two tests in a pack, individually wrapped to keep dry until use. The tests are really simple to use.  Simply pee on the stick (or in a pot then dip the stick in for five seconds if you wish). Wait three minutes and then read the results. Try to hold off on going to the loo for a while before testing if you can so that your urine is more concentrated. Results are easy to read. One line for a negative result , 2 lines (even if it's a faint one) for a positive.Good luck!

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2024Verified Purchase
I see a lot of people saying this gives you false positives, however a pregnancy test can not do that. They can only give you false negatives. FR is a lot more sensitive than the clearblue which means if you get a positive and you start your period unfortunately it wasn’t false it was just a very early loss that wouldn’t have been known if you didn’t test. Evaporation lines are colourless and positive lines are coloured.I love this product better as clearblue is known for its evaporation lines a lot more.

really early response
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2013Verified Purchase
I bought this after reading in some website that this was the most sensitive and reliable early result test. After reading some more on the web, I decided to take it only 2 days before my period was due, but it gave me already a faint positive.As I never used the test I was afraid of evap lines, but they have a helpline, which I called and was clarified that this tests do not give evap lines, so it was most likely a positive.To be honest, this are the major advantages of this test: a really early result and a certainty of no evap lines, so a positive will always be a positive. The results are offered in a great time frame, mine was in 2 mins and the result lasted for at least a week.The only downside is that the test line will always be lighter than the control line, this is not an actual downside, but as it was my first positive, and which I repeated 5 days later, as recommended by the helpline, and it was still lighter, kind of faint. I searched the web and realized it was normal in this test to happen.So apart from the fact the test line will always appear faint, if there is one then it's positive, it means to me a great deal of simplicity, the quick result makes it better and the no evap lines feature makes it nearly perfect!

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 July 2023Style Name: UK VersionVerified Purchase
I got this for my daughter as a gift and she liked it a lot. but I will say the flashing lights on the bitzze are really annoying but don't seem to bother my daughter too much although once she did say she is worried it might damage her eyes. The controls are easy info for a young child from like 7 and over to use but would not give it to someone younger as the controls are a little fiddly and the screen that displays the animals is very delicate. I was a little disappointed to know there is not much to do after you collect all fifteen pets the only thing that you really can do is feed it play games and pet it or respond to the help messages which is honestly enough and good for £30 but buying a Tamagotchi for £30 you can do a lot more though I do understand that you can literally touch this one which is nice. but overall I think it is good value for money and my daughter does love it. also, I do think even though I said a lot of negatives this is a really cool toy (especially for £30), and that's why I gave it 5 stars. but would recommend bearing in mind what I said to make sure this is the write toy for your child.

You can unlock more pets, and theres quite a few to collect, some rare, although my daughter unlocked them all within a couple of days which was a little disappointing as I thought it would take longer.I hope she's not bored with it and it's not a short lived item. I love how it works though where you can stroke the pet, definitely feels more interactive then a tamagotchi. The item is quite heavy, tamagotchis are a lot more portable and lightweight so this is a down side.

What a treat, bought for me by my wife as a birthday present which happens to be today, she has made this a very special birthday for me! I have the Gold, Green and Platinum labels by Johnnie Walker as I am a fan of their blends, each of them have their own characteristics and stunning flavours, with an ice cold glass of water in a separate glass to wash out the pallet, all the flavours come alive. This blend made to the 1869 recipe has a wonderful deep taste made with great care to be treasured. If all your after is a whisky to get drunk on the stock to the Red or Black labels, if you want a whisky to savour, enjoy and really appreciate then spend the extra and go for it, at just over £100 then this is well worth the dosh!!!!!!!!!

Ok this might be a small point but I bought this for over £150 to give to my grandad as a gift. I was so disappointed to see as soon as I opened the box that someone had somewhat amateurly tried to peel the sticker off the box, had been unsuccessful in doing so, and so just left a sticky half peeled residue… it’s literally the first thing I saw when I opened the box.When you pay this much for a bottle of whisky (which is a gift) you just feel so uneasy when this is the first thing you see. It’s unlikely that it’s counterfeit but I’m still a bit put off and there doesn’t seem to be a way to request a refund - so frustrating.

Great taste, great colour, a wonderful blended whisky from Johnnie Walker. Gifted on from my kids for my 60th Birthday. This is most definitely a sipping whisky. I would recommend drinking this exquisite whisky on its own, neat, with not a thing in the glass, not even ice.  Of course it's personal choice, and it's you whisky, so drink it whatever way you like.On initial tasting most of the liquid disappears to leave a very nice taste. Even my wife likes this one and she detests whisky!This Blue Label is very expensive. Personally, I think it's worth it, but I didn't pay for it, as it was a birthday gift from my kids! It is very gift-able, if you have a couple of kids or more.Lovely stuff.

Condition:Bottle clip on the inside was broken as seen in many other reviews. Shame really considering the price. Could be looked after better by Amazon.Value:I would say the whisky is more of a £60-80 value in terms of flavour and notes. It doesn't really have the sense of rarity with how readily available it is, however, this is still a very nice whisky and worth trying. I'm happy to have this in my collection and will drink it slow but personally I feel that Green Label is better.Giftable?:Yeah, would be a nice gift as presentation is lovely but unless the gifted person really knows their whisky, stick to Green Label or Gold Reserve.Flavour:Neat was quite nice but not as smooth as my preference.Ice was more enjoyable and aftertaste was better.Cocktail is probably very nice if you're willing to mix something with this value.A generous 4/5 as saying a high 3/5 doesn't feel quite right.

With its unparalleled scope, innovative gameplay, and stunning attention to detail, this game stands as a shining beacon of excellence in the realm of video game storytelling.From the very first glimpse of the vast, open landscape, you are immediately transported into a world teeming with life and wonder. The sheer scale of Hyrule is awe-inspiring, and the seamless exploration it offers is unparalleled. Every mountain peak, lush forest, and hidden cavern beckons you to uncover its secrets, inviting you to lose yourself in the sheer beauty of the environment.But it is not just the mesmerizing visuals that make Breath of the Wild a standout experience.

Greatest game of all time?!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 March 2017Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase
Having never written an Amazon review for a product, I just could not hide my feelings away from this fabulous game. As you can, I'm in love with this game and being a huge Zelda fan my expectations and anticipation were exceedingly than any other video game. Having played video games for 20 years does this rank above them all? Lets find out.GraphicsThere have been mentions of frame issues from several publications, however during my playing 20 hours of playing time with the game these do not detract from the gameplay experience (Note, when playing docked frame rates do become more frequent). Aside from these hiccups, Nintendo has created there most beautiful game to date. From the beautiful vistas in the outer world to the charming and vibrant villages you come across in the game, Nintendo has done an excellent of potraying the original Legend of Zelda (1986) NES game which has inspired the design of Breath of the Wild. The varied locations, the beautiful sceneries and landscapes make this a beautiful game to behold. (9.8/10)GameplayNintendo has created their most dense, articulate and compelling gameplay mechanics in their entire video gaming history. From cooking food, to managing inventory, upgrading clothing/weapon slots...the list goes on. The game is truly massive and yet it is a harsh and brutal game that requires patience and deep thinking. The depature of 100s of shrines compared to the dungeons (which there are in this game) is a huge change that has seemingly impressed me so far. Combat is fairly challenging and it's important to workout your enemies movements, for you to strike and possibly encounter a flurry attack. One minor complaint that may differ from other individuals are the horse controls which feel stiff and unresponsive to control at times. Though if that is the only thing to complaon about the gameplay in Breath of the Wild then that is saying something. This iteration of gameplay mechanics in a Zelda game is near flawless. (10/10)ValueIs this worth you money? Considering this was made for the Wii U and those that still own one it would be hard to recommend to buy a Nintendo Switch just for Zelda as launch titles are pretty dire where there are no other big games to choosr from. However, to those individuals I say this; you miss the form factor of playing Breath of the Wild wherever you go, whether it be in bed, on a commute, airplane or even the toilet. That is the value proposition here. The game itself is more than 100 hours (plus DLC), which all the more makes it worth more than the moneys worth. To those that have never tried a Zelda game this is perfect to get into the series, whereas Nintendo and Zelda fans alike probably own the game already. This is a must buy if your purchase the Nintendo SwitchVerdictIs this the greatest game of all time? Having been ranked inside the top 5 games in history on metacritic there is no reason to believe why it may not be. Personally, I believw this is an even greater achievement that Nintendo has accomplished with the Zelda franchise and formula since Ocarina of time (which is a timeless classic by the way). But seeing how much the series has developed and changed over the years building up to what the developers had envisioned a Zelda game to be all those years ago, this is a masterpiece on open-world design. Breath of the Wild is truly breathtaking and one of the most joyous and satisfied gaming experiences I have had since maybe The Last of Us. Is this the greatest game of all time? The answer to that question is a resounding 'YES'! If not, this is the best game Nintendo has ever created and will be a timeless classic in many decades to come. (10/10)Score: 10/10

This is an amazing piece of kit! The 10.1 inch Screen is bright with very sharp images and I love the motion tracking feature. (This really impressed my wife- she now loves this and all my other Echo products around the house).Set-up is simple if you have an Amazon account and it has to be placed on a flat secure surface or it notifies you and goes idle, until it is secure. It has a very wide turning circle so give it a clear space either side.I haven't set up the Echo to Echo video feature with the Echo Show 8 in the Living Room room. (I want to surprise my wife with this feature) so we have that to look forward to very soon.It is very expensive though, but I feel a very worth while investment, especially if you don't want to pay for a high grade speaker system.It feels sturdy, but is not too heavy and looks fantastic with it's simple styling and set up giving it a futuristic look and feel.The sound quality is excellent too and being able to watch Netflix and Prime Video is just great.This is by far the best Echo Show model I have seen, to date and I love it!Update: I have now tried the video chat and it works a treat. My wife is very pleased she doesn't always have to msg me if I'm in my ""study"" and we can chat face-to-face.  The screen image is excellent and the sound is really good too!!

This echo is absolutely fantastic, the screen quality is equivalent to a top end TV, the sound is superb and it’s a brilliant addition to any modern kitchen.Be very careful, during set up, be sure to activate tracking so that it follows you, also be very careful when you’re setting up profiles and make sure it knows everybody in the house by face, also control the rotation carefully so that it doesn’t bump into anything.Also, during dropping or video calls, it’s a good idea to not run around, give it time to recognise your face and try and move as gentle as you can and it will always track you and my daughter regularly tries to make it lose her and rarely succeeds…All the people that say that this doesn’t track you either haven’t set it up properly or are expecting too much of it, keep redoing the set up to make sure you get it exactly right, and if you can use it while facing the camera, you’ll have the best experience, Amazon are really not out the part for this device, especially at this price point during Blackfriday

By far the best echo I've used (and the least deaf)Bought it for the living room while on offer (£219.99) to replace our stereo as a home audio system. Sound quality is excellent, the screen looks amazing and crisp, I do like the screen follow mode however we have it disabled due to the location of the echo.If you're looking for a decent option for audio then I would recommend this product.

Missing basic features
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2024Colour Name: Glacier White FabricStyle Name: Echo Show 10Verified Purchase
I bought this to replace our previous Echo Show 10 model. While there are definitely some big improvements, it still feels as though the newest Echo Show 10 is missing some basic features that I would have expected to be included in newer models by now.So let's start with what's better than the previous model:1) Processing power - unlike the previous model, this one doesn't stutter or freeze. It handles things pretty smoothly.2) It moves - it's a handy feature in an open plan room, especially in a kitchen/ diner, where you're moving about the room and might be cooking, following a recipe or playing music. It's also a great feature for checking in on the dogs if I'm out.Now let's look at what's worse:1) Sometimes I find myself shouting at Alexa to even get her to hear me on this model. It can be very frustrating and doesn't work as well as the previous version. And even when it finally does hear me, it doesn't always get it right. I've changed the name on our devices to 'Ziggy' and the number of times she's played music by Ziggy Marley is extremely frustrating.2) The sound quality is good. I wouldn't say it's worse than the old model, but it's different and the bass isn't as punchy.Now let's look at what needs to be improved:1) Volume control - When you adjust the volume, the volume of everything is increased or decreased. I don't want Alexa booming at me when I'm playing music loud. She doesn't need to as whatever she is playing is reduced as soon as it hears her name so it can hear what you're saying. I've never understood why she needs to shout back at you when the music volume is automatically lowered! I want to be able to control the volume independently for voice responses, music, alarms and notifications.2) Personalisation - Amazon has a habit of creating very bland alarm tones, notifications and jingles (like the power on jingle when you start up a Firestick that sounds like tripping over in mud). Some of us would like to hear a futuristic tone, acoustic sounds, nature sounds, jazz sounds etc. I would like to make my Alexa my own, not what a megacorp decides I should like.3) Output - I want to be able to play my music through Bluetooth speakers, but I only want the music to be played through the speakers, nothing else... No Alexa voice, no alarms, no notifications, no recipe instructions... Just my music. Notifications and Alexa voice etc could still be played through my Echo but I'd like to keep them separate.4) Design - The design of the Echo Show 10 is nice but it's not very futuristic. The edge/bezel of the screen is still far too thick. The camera needs to move to a central point above the screen. There is nothing ""wrong"" with the design. It's just when customers buy an Echo, they buy it because it's convenient and also because the idea is still a little bit futuristic. It would be nice to see a sexy and sleek Echo device that looks as though it's come from  2050, not 2015. The whole point of Alexa when Amazon first released it was that it was futuristic. Back then it didn't need to look futuristic because the whole concept was. But speaking to Alexa is now a normal part of our lives so the look of the device is now even more important than it was originally.5) Privacy - I would really like to see much more on device processing.6) Video calls - I use videos calls 90% of the time rather than voice calls on my phone. I would use video calling on my Echoes too if the apps were available. It would be great to see more video call apps included with the Echo... Google Meet, Messenger, WhatsApp, Zoom and Skype.So am I glad I upgraded? Definitely YES. Using the new Echo Show 10 is nice, cleaner and the processing power increase makes a huge difference. But I'm just a little bit disappointed that the features, design and technology haven't really progressed that far. I've really only bought this upgrade as using Alexa has become a necessary part of our every day life in our household. It controls lights, TVs, plugs, music and much more. Our old Echo was showing its age and this new one is really only a small upgrade but in my opinion, the next version needs a pretty massive overhaul of some basic features and design to stay ahead of the competition.

It's fun to see the unit follow you around. It's not perfect and if more than one person  is close it may get confused . It has the same functionality as the majority of echo devices and it has very good sound quality . The screen has limited functionality but that's a feature of the echo show devices. You ca  use YouTube as well as amazon prime  for viewing. Verbal instructions are a little more limited than Google devices but amazon also has its strong points and the device is unique

My optician has always been concerned that my eyes suffer from chronic dryness, so that its difficult to see in the mornings. After 3 eye operations  -  2 for cataracts and one to improve a muscle - my doctor added eyedrops to my regular prescription and all was improved. Then a couple of years ago, for some penny-pinching reason my eye drops were changed - the new ones were difficult to apply - you got  what seemed to be a spoonful at a time - not a drop. I made it my intention to complain to the doctor - then forgot and with Covid it wasn't possible to speak to a doctor.Three months ago I went to my optician for a regular check and he immediately pounced on the state of my eyes -  he said I must have different eye drops and the best he could do then was to sell me the recommended drops and tell me to ask my doctor to use those regularly.SO - the drops were Hycosan Extra and I have used them at least twice daily since then. Eyes are much better, drops are perfect and so easily applied.  Just as the optician promised, they lasted well over 3 months at my normal dosage, and he could tell me that even though I was paying, the new drops were much more economical than the other ones.So - I still have to sort my doctor and prescription out sometime. Meanwhile, as I will now be away for a week and my first Hycosan drops have been used, I needed new drops quickly.  A quick investigation and I was delighted to find I could get Hycosan from Amazon.  Perfect service and delivered  so swiftly.I can totally recommend Hycosan Extra. - sight is important and Hycosan drops are so good.

 The Versace Blue Jeans Eau De Toilette is a fragrance that promises and delivers a refreshing burst of bergamot, citrus, and lime, enveloped in a masculine aura. My initial interaction with this aftershave was through its packaging, a metal tin adorned in the iconic Versace style and looking like jeans, which, considering the product's affordability, felt like an added luxury.The packaging is aesthetically pleasing, aligning well with Versace's reputation for style and elegance. The blue glass bottle, apart from its visual appeal, is practical, offering a good grip which is especially useful when handling with wet hands. With 4 lion heads placed around the bottle and the iconic Versace pattern around the base, you couldn’t ask for more.The spray mechanism works flawlessly, delivering a generous mist of fragrance with each press. The scent itself exceeded my expectations, especially given the product's price point. It offers a fresh, day-long wearability that I was specifically looking for.The bottle's thick glass and the well-constructed spray nozzle suggest a durability that’s good for regular use. The fragrance's longevity is commendable, with the scent lingering pleasantly for hours without the need for reapplication.Its refreshing scent profile makes it a comfortable choice for daily use, providing a sense of awakening and freshness throughout the day. While the sweetness of the scent might not appeal to everyone, it strikes a pleasant balance that I personally find appealing.When compared to other aftershaves in the same quality bracket, Versace Blue Jeans stands out for its exceptional value. Many comparable fragrances command a much higher price tag, making this product a steal.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 July 2023Size Name: 75 ml (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
The initial burst of citrus and lavender is refreshing and uplifting, creating a youthful and energetic aura around me. As the scent settles, the heart notes of geranium and jasmine add a touch of sophistication, making it suitable for both casual and more formal occasions.One of the standout features of this fragrance is its longevity. The scent lingers on my skin throughout the day, requiring only a few spritzes for a lasting effect. It's perfect for those busy days when I don't have time for frequent touch-ups.Moreover, the sillage of Versace Blue Jeans is just right—noticeable enough to leave a lasting impression but not overpowering to others around me.The bottle design is sleek and modern, adding a touch of luxury to my fragrance collection. The sturdy construction ensures it can withstand the rigors of travel without any leaks or spills.However, I did notice that the scent might not appeal to everyone, as fragrances are a subjective matter. Some might find it too strong or not entirely to their liking, which could affect its overall popularity.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 March 2024Size Name: 75 ml (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I have been collecting fragrances for several years now, and have multiple £100 plus bottles, I have added this one mainly as a gym scent., but is it worth it?...This review will be based on the fragrance as a fragrance initially, rather than it's price point.Bottle: I like the design, reminds me of an old school glass coke bottle, the cap is very cheap and plastic, and the atomiser is not great.Each pump of the atomiser minimal fragrance comes out and it's a tight stream.I much prefer a wider cloud, so you have to use a good 8 sprays to have a suitable amount on your skin.Scent: it has far too many notes to list, but to simplify, citrus at the top, floral and woods in the mid, more woods in the base.The opening is awful... Far to sharp, the initial citrus smells like citronella candles, or lemon cleaner... Very sharp and very alcoholic... Incredibly synthetic.However once that dispapates (takes a good 20 minutes) and you get into the mid notes it settles down into a powdery floral, musky scent which I actually really like.Longevity: on my skin it's average at approx 6 hours.Verdict, if you can get past the opening, it drys down into a nice scent, it is very synthetic, however it is fresh and clean with a little musk.It's worth adding to any collection.Now for price this is good value, not many better at this price point.

I'm not normally a fragrance wearer but was encouraged by my wife to try and find my 'signature scent' and I have a feeling I may have found it at the first attempt. I chose this partly because the other reviews were good, but also because I didn't want to spend a fortune on something that I then didn't like. But both of us really like it. I'm not going to try and describe the scent because I can't, but it's masculine without being overpowering and seems to have good staying power.

A classic party toy, well recommended
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2015Style Name: English versionVerified Purchase
Noisy, loud, slightly idiotic.  Repetitive with it.  Bop It!is an utterly infuriating party game/device which calls out instructions for you to carry out - ""pull it"", ""twist it"", ""bop it"", etc - before passing it on to the next unfortunate game player.  For all its irritating idiocy, its a strangely compelling game, and before long you'll find resistance broken as you too join in the bopping, twisting, pulling frenzy.This version of Bop It is a stripped down version, with slightly less to do, in a slightly smaller package than the original (which had spins and flicks as well).  But its all the better for it.  Just as much fun to play, and easier to pack/store.  My kids regularly pick it up to play with on their own, or to challenge friends and each other.  And it always seems to make them laugh.A classic toy, well implemented.  Delighted to have bought it.

I don't mind the noise - at least it's happy!  I love the way a single child can play on it by themselves when ""no-one will play with me!"" but also it can be played with together for those days when everyone is getting on fine!

We weren’t sure about spending the money on this, but we have a happy girl at Christmas. It is sturdy and has lots of accessories. It took about an hour to build on Christmas Eve, but could do it faster now we know what we’re doing!It might be obvious to say, but it is big, especially with the slide sticking out to the side.

Decent enough quality for Barbie brand but way overpriced.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2020Style Name: 2020 DreamhouseVerified Purchase
This house is HUGE but luckily it fits neatly under the stairs. My 8 and 10 year old girls were thrilled with this and I have barely seen them since Christmas! I watched the price carefully for some time and bought it (also using the kids wish list discount) for £150. For this price it was a bargain (main joint present for two girls). I would never pay the full price for it as it would be way overpriced. I was apprehensive about getting it at all as it is basically a huge, plastic thing. Barbie plastic tends to be cheap and breaks easily - not quality like Lego, Playmobil or Sylvanian Families (which will last and can be reused over and over and can be handed down which is what I prefer) but my girls wanted the Dreamhouse and I have to say whilst putting it together it did feel sturdier than expected. It took a couple of hours to assemble and was an easy, one female job!

Discontinued in UK
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 February 2022Verified Purchase
This was sadly discontinued in the UK as it wasn't selling as well as the company had hoped. As such, any new stock is imported directly from the US where it's still available and the labelling reflects this. The contents are the same as before, but the labels aren't applied straight for some reason. The display box hasn't been included for at least 5 years so people should manage their expectations. The listing does very clearly state that what's sent may not be the same as the pictures though.There are ""alternatives"" to this product such as Cazcabel (thicker, sweeter, 51% agave ""mixto"" rather than the 100% agave of Patron), Mr Black (bitter and unpleasant, as well as overpriced), and Kahlua (cheap, brown sugar syrup), but none will satisfy you if you've come to love the silky smooth taste of Patron Cafe. Some are however serviceable if you're looking to mix them in cocktails. This nectar should always be sipped neat in my opinion, it's too special to be ruined with cheap vanilla vodka or the admittedly yummy chocolate Baileys.It's currently selling for 32 which is roughly what you'd have paid without promotions before it was discontinued, but I wouldn't personally pay more than that and would like to see it closer to 25. It was 50 last week, all prices direct from Amazon. Some third party sellers are definitely taking advantage of the fact that this drink is coveted and requesting double that amount, and it's frankly disgusting behaviour.Due to accessibility and wildly fluctuating prices this is unfortunately no longer an every day drink for me and has been moved to a special occasion purchase, but I think that makes it all the more of a treat when I do eventually pop open a bottle. There really is nothing else like it.

Thrilling Racing Fun with Mario Kart
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 July 2023Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase
Mario Kart has been a staple in the world of gaming for years, providing thrilling racing experiences and countless hours of entertainment. This beloved game franchise continues to deliver an enjoyable and action-packed racing adventure that keeps players coming back for more.One of the standout features of Mario Kart is its engaging gameplay. The races are fast-paced, filled with adrenaline-pumping moments, and offer a healthy dose of competition. The intuitive controls make it accessible to players of all skill levels, ensuring that both beginners and seasoned gamers can have fun and enjoy the experience.The vibrant and visually appealing graphics in Mario Kart add to its charm. The colorful race tracks, imaginative environments, and detailed character designs create an immersive and visually captivating world. The attention to detail in each course brings them to life, providing a visually stimulating experience that enhances the overall enjoyment.The variety of race tracks and game modes in Mario Kart offers a great deal of replay value. With a wide selection of courses to choose from, each with its unique challenges and surprises, players can continue to discover new and exciting elements with each playthrough. The multiplayer mode, both online and local, further enhances the excitement by allowing players to compete against friends or other players from around the world.Mario Kart’s inclusion of iconic Nintendo characters adds a delightful touch of nostalgia and familiarity. Being able to race as beloved characters such as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, or Bowser adds a layer of connection and excitement, especially for fans of the Nintendo franchise. Each character also has their own unique attributes, adding a strategic element to the races.While Mario Kart offers a fantastic gaming experience overall, there are a few areas that could be improved. The occasional presence of “rubber-banding” or artificial intelligence adjustments in races can sometimes lead to frustration, as it can feel unfair or limit the player’s ability to maintain a consistent lead. Additionally, the battle mode, while enjoyable, may lack the same depth and intensity as the main racing component.In summary, Mario Kart provides an exhilarating and visually captivating racing experience that is sure to entertain players of all ages. Its engaging gameplay, stunning graphics, variety of tracks, and inclusion of beloved characters make it a standout game franchise. While there may be a few minor areas that could be improved upon, Mario Kart undoubtedly earns its place as a must-play racing game and continues to deliver thrills and fun for fans worldwide.

Smooth and beautiful!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 April 2017Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase
Mario Kart is probably my favourite pick-up-and-play game. It doesn’t require hours of grinding to become proficient at it, and you don’t need to refer to an online guide to remind you what to do if you’ve not played it for months/years – you can just play it. I do like to unlock everything though and I tend to spend hours unlocking tracks and characters, I have spent years becoming familiar with the tracks and perfecting my character and car choice (Daisy in the B-Dasher, in case you’re interested.) For those completely new to Mario Kart, it’s a racing game which is more about fun rather than realistic driving physics.  You race around a range of tracks collecting items which can be thrown, dropped, etc and items are ‘weighted’ so that those at the back of the race tend to get items designed to assist them, this means that newbies can still involve themselves in the race rather than just straggling behind.  The awesome racers aren’t guaranteed to win – there’s always a chance of a Blue Shell whacking them at the last corner! Some years ago I got a Wii U specifically for Mario Kart and was blown away by how great it looked, it didn’t take much for the Switch version to turn my head.My wife was sceptical about the deluxe version of the game – is it worth getting Mario Kart 8 *again* when I already have it for the Wii U? The answer in short is: yes.And here’s why…Nintendo probably realise that Mario Kart 8 (Wii U) owners are likely to own this version too, so all the previous additional Downloadable Content is included along with a sprinkle of new characters. So all the tracks are unlocked right-away, but those who put the hours in are rewarded with random ‘parts’ being unlocked (tyres, etc). The main difference in terms of content is the improved Battle Mode. The Wii U Battle-Mode was terrible. On the Switch it has been revamped and the Balloon Battle mode is more like the battle mode I loved so much on the Nintendo 64.  This is one of five different battle modes:• Balloon Battle (pop opponent’s balloons)• Bob-omb Blast (lob bombs at each other to pop balloons)• Renegade Roundup (team battle with Piranha Plants)• Coin Runners (collect the most coins to win)• Shine Thief (keep hold of the Shine Sprite for an extended period of time)And these can be played across 8 different Battle Courses. (My favourite being “SNES Battle Course 1”. )Another new feature is Smart Steering.  It’s a bit like when you go bowling with the kids and you can have the gutters blocked off, Smart Steering stops you from dropping off the sides of the track. This means that newbies and really casual gamers can join in and not be frustrated at not being able to manage half a lap on Rainbow Road. It’s a great feature which means that a completely mixed ability group can play together and still have fun. For those completely new to racing games and struggling with both using items and controlling the kart, ""auto acceleration"" can be used.

After playing this, you can’t go back to the Wii U version without it seeming jerky, the animations on the Wii U look staggered in comparison to the flawless Switch. There are numerous online videos showing side-by-side comparisons in which there’s an undeniable difference. However, it has to be experienced to be appreciated.Multiplayer is excellent, 2 player is split-screen on either the Switch or TV, any more is TV only (if you’re on the same Switch, but you can play full screen if it’s on-line play). Those with little hands will find the bundled controllers surprisingly fine for extended play, but for those with massive hands like me – the Pro-Controller is absolutely brilliant and you’ll not struggle to hold an item behind you while drifting around corners.In a nutshell: You can see why people are calling this the definitive version of Mario Kart. The Wii U version was excellent, and this improves on it by adding a few new features and fixes the battle mode. Those who criticise the Switch and say it’s under-powered have completely misunderstood what a games console is all about – playability is king and this title is probably one of the greatest games in video game history. If you aren't interested in battle mode, then the smoother graphics alone makes this a worthy purchase. This is great for die hard 'Karters and instantly playable by those who have never played Mario kart before.

            Mario Kart is probably my favourite pick-up-and-play game. It doesn’t require hours of grinding to become proficient at it, and you don’t need to refer to an online guide to remind you what to do if you’ve not played it for months/years – you can just play it. I do like to unlock everything though and I tend to spend hours unlocking tracks and characters, I have spent years becoming familiar with the tracks and perfecting my character and car choice (Daisy in the B-Dasher, in case you’re interested.) For those completely new to Mario Kart, it’s a racing game which is more about fun rather than realistic driving physics.  You race around a range of tracks collecting items which can be thrown, dropped, etc and items are ‘weighted’ so that those at the back of the race tend to get items designed to assist them, this means that newbies can still involve themselves in the race rather than just straggling behind.  The awesome racers aren’t guaranteed to win – there’s always a chance of a Blue Shell whacking them at the last corner! Some years ago I got a Wii U specifically for Mario Kart and was blown away by how great it looked, it didn’t take much for the Switch version to turn my head.My wife was sceptical about the deluxe version of the game – is it worth getting Mario Kart 8 *again* when I already have it for the Wii U? The answer in short is: yes.And here’s why…Nintendo probably realise that Mario Kart 8 (Wii U) owners are likely to own this version too, so all the previous additional Downloadable Content is included along with a sprinkle of new characters. So all the tracks are unlocked right-away, but those who put the hours in are rewarded with random ‘parts’ being unlocked (tyres, etc). The main difference in terms of content is the improved Battle Mode. The Wii U Battle-Mode was terrible. On the Switch it has been revamped and the Balloon Battle mode is more like the battle mode I loved so much on the Nintendo 64.  This is one of five different battle modes:• Balloon Battle (pop opponent’s balloons)• Bob-omb Blast (lob bombs at each other to pop balloons)• Renegade Roundup (team battle with Piranha Plants)• Coin Runners (collect the most coins to win)• Shine Thief (keep hold of the Shine Sprite for an extended period of time)And these can be played across 8 different Battle Courses. (My favourite being “SNES Battle Course 1”. )Another new feature is Smart Steering.  It’s a bit like when you go bowling with the kids and you can have the gutters blocked off, Smart Steering stops you from dropping off the sides of the track. This means that newbies and really casual gamers can join in and not be frustrated at not being able to manage half a lap on Rainbow Road. It’s a great feature which means that a completely mixed ability group can play together and still have fun. For those completely new to racing games and struggling with both using items and controlling the kart, ""auto acceleration"" can be used. This just keeps your car moving forwards, I doubt it will be used very often but it could be good for those with hand mobility issues who otherwise could find controlling numerous buttons prohibitive to play.Other content changes include some new items to collect and re-introduces the ability to hold 2 items at once – which I’m pleased to see (always good to have a spare banana tucked away).The biggest difference you’ll notice though, is how much better the game looks.This is essentially a port of the Wii U game, and graphically speaking there’s the odd bit of garnish added to the original graphics – but the increased resolution and frame rate makes a huge difference.

🎮😂 ""PS5 Controller: More Than a Button Pusher, It's My Wingman!"" 😂🎮
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024Platform For Display: PlayStation 5Edition: DualSenseVerified Purchase
Ah, the PS5 DualSense controller, or as I like to call it, the ultimate wingman in the game of life. Let me take you on a journey through my experience with this piece of gaming genius.Upon its arrival, the packaging screamed, ""Get ready for a tactile rollercoaster!"" Unboxing it felt like opening a treasure chest – a treasure chest full of joy, potential embarrassment, and a surprising amount of haptic feedback. The DualSense didn't just come with features; it came with possibilities.Now, I chose this controller because, like me, it's not just about button pushing. It's about the immersive experience – the haptic feedback and dynamic triggers. I wanted to feel my gaming environment like never before. Little did I know, it would also enhance my non-gaming life in ways I couldn't predict.Picture this: Date night. I brought out the PS5 for some casual gaming with a potential romantic interest. As we played, the haptic feedback kicked in. The controller vibrated like a mischievous cupid, turning a simple gaming session into an unexpected dance of tactile sensations. Let's just say, the DualSense turned the game into a date-night MVP. Wink, wink.Embarrassment #1: I decided to test the built-in microphone during a heated gaming moment. Turns out, it was also transmitting my not-so-eloquent victory dance and celebratory shouts to my online buddies. Lesson learned: mute is my new best friend.Emboldened by my dating success, I thought, ""Why not introduce the controller to my parents?"" My dad tried the adaptive triggers, simulating the tension of a bowstring. He released it, sending the arrow flying – right into the TV. A costly misunderstanding, but the controller handled it like a champ.Work took an unexpected turn when my boss, curious about the hype, wanted to try the controller during a team-building gaming session. The adaptive triggers made a routine racing game feel like a high-stakes pursuit. Unfortunately, my boss, consumed by the intensity, stood up, knocking over the coffee, and declared, ""This is too much pressure!"" There goes my Employee of the Month title.Now, this controller didn't just cause chaos; it improved my quality of life. The haptic feedback made mundane tasks exciting. Opening a jar felt like defeating a boss level, and typing turned into a rhythmic dance of vibrations. I became more attractive, not just to potential partners but to everyday challenges.Oh, and the adaptive triggers? Let's just say they're irresistible. Friends who tried it couldn't resist the urge to experience the unique tension and force variations. It became the star of my gaming parties, stealing the spotlight from even the most captivating conversation.In conclusion, the PS5 DualSense Wireless Controller isn't just a gaming accessory; it's a life accessory. It's my confidant, my entertainer, and my accidental troublemaker. If you want more than just button pushes, if you want a sidekick in the comedy of life, this controller is your player two.Please appreciate this review with a chuckle and a like. Positive feedback might just convince Sony to hire me as the official PS5 controller comedian. 🎮😂

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2024Style Name: Ryzen 7 7800X3DVerified Purchase
Alright, let me tell you about this Ryzen 7 7800X3D beast I just slapped into my rig. First off, it's a game-changer. Seriously, I swapped out my old CPU for this bad boy, and it's like my computer got a turbo boost.The performance jump is no joke. Whether I'm gaming, editing videos, or just doing regular multitasking stuff, this thing handles it all like a champ. It's got cores for days, and that 3D V-Cache tech? Pure wizardry. Everything just feels smoother and snappier.And installation? Piece of cake. Pop off the old cooler, drop in the Ryzen, slap some thermal paste, screw down the cooler, and boom, you're in business. AMD really made it idiot-proof, which is great for someone like me who's more of a software guy.Overall, if you're looking to level up your PC without breaking the bank, this Ryzen 7 7800X3D is the way to go. Trust me, you won't regret it.

Better options for similar price, stock cooler is insufficient.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2023Style Name: Ryzen 5 7600Verified Purchase
When choosing between this and the x version there is very little price difference. However seeing as aftermarket coolers are around £40 I opted for this model as it came with a stock cooler. I wrongly presumed that the low tdp of this cpu and that reviews said the cooler was sufficient, meant that I could use a stock cooler and save the £40 for an aftermarket one.Sadly, the stock cooler is very small, I play games like rust and the cpu is hitting 70 degree when only under 50% load and the fan is noisy. A real shame and I regret not buying the x model now as I've had to go for the £40 aftermarket cooler anyway just to keep the thing coool.As a processor, very good, runs fast, seems to perform perfectly well and my £550 gpu is the bottleneck in games still. But the stock cooler.... sush a waste, don't use it. It's noisy and does not work well.

Treated myself to a fire tablet on Black Friday. I just needed a tablet to watch movies on- and for that it’s perfect. Set up was very easy, I downloded Netflix, YouTube and bbc Iplayer with no issues.So some drawbacks- it’s a bit clunky and glitchy. Touchscreen isn’t very..smooth? It seems to lag a bit and I find I need a press a few times or very hard. It has froze on me before and restarted but as I said- it’s cheap and basic, so not expecting much anyway, but it’s a good little tablet nonetheless.

Replacement for an earlier (2017) Fire HD 8.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2024Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBConfiguration: with AdsColour Name: BlackStyle Name: Fire HD 8Verified Purchase
This is a great tablet for the price. I use it primarily as a Kindle reader when colour  or speed matters. My other paperwhite Kindle is better for reading out of doors because the Fire HD 8 has a very reflective screen, but for quickly scrolling through several hundred books, reading books with colour illustrations and watching Prime videos, iPlayer etc, the Fire HD 8 is ideal. The cost of upgrading my 2017 HD8 to the 2022 HD8 (Android 5 to Android 11, and Fire OS 5 to Fire OS 8) was only £37 (after trade-in and discount) which was worth it for the improved performance.

I missed out on the Black Friday half price sale , because I couldn't decide whether to get one or not . When I did decide to get one , the price went back up . Then I noticed a returned tablet at the Black Friday price for sale , with a thirty day warranty and return, so went for that ,The Tablet looks unused , everything inside the box as new , except the box itself , which was ripped in places , but it was delivered in Amazon cardboard packaging .Apart from a surprisingly longish time to recharge it , compared to my cheap android TeleCast tablet , I'm pleased with this buy at the price I paid .

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 April 2021Verified Purchase
Good price, but I have to agree that there's very little flavour to them; it's watered down to be more like a tonic.The recommendation is to drink it with salad and other light food. I would have to agree, at least Budweiser is up front about it so I can't knock them for it.• Aimed at people who want a light refreshing beer that isn't overpowering. Not for lovers of craft beer.Personally I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't buy it again despite it being lower in cost to the original.

Love these headphones
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2024Colour Name: BlackPattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
These are more expensive than both of my son's noise cancelling headphones put together, but I love them, and you get the Sony build quality and sound quality to boot. They are exceptionally comfortable for long periods. Easy to connect to iPhone and iPad, they last for ages on a charge, to the point that I keep losing the cable as I charge them so infrequently.Great on a plane where the constant noise ruins listening through conventional headphones. Noise cancelling does not cut out all noise, so you can still hear the wife shouting at you, but not her snoring, which is excellent when listening to music in bed.The app is very good and so is playing with the settings of the EQ as I think they are set up by deaf music haters in the factory. The ability to fine tune the EQ them is so completely essential to get a sound that you are happy with. I am extremely particular with how my music sounds, being a musician and studio producer. Over hyped bass and muddy treble does not cut it for me.There are other complicated features that you can enable, but to be honest, I could see much difference and therefore the point.Touch control on the ear pads is very useful, changing volume, pausing, etc. Mic quality is easily good enough to make and receive phone calls whilst on a walk, and you can invoke Siri to do your bidding.These were bought to replace an earlier model that I had had for years, that I managed to sit on, and break the swivel joint at the side of the headphones which allows you to collapse them down to put in a case. I fixed it with epoxy and gaffer tape and then I think I left them somewhere and, bye bye headphones. These are pretty much exactly the same, although I did have to fiddle extensively with the EQ and suffer all kinds of over thinking before settling back to normal life and music appreciation.Worth the extra money? Read the reviews, read other reviews outside of Amazon... yes, they're worth it. Just don't sit on them or lose them.

Best headphones ever!!!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2024Colour Name: BlackPattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I bought these years ago, and now recently bought another pair as a gift for my dad. They're the best headphones, so comfy, amazing noise cancelling and the battery lasts so so long! Even when it dies, I can pop it on charge for a quick 15 minutes and it can last me another couple hours just on that.I think they're sleek and stylish, and the sound quality is so much better than my previous headphones. My dad is also super impressed.I'd personally buy these still over the newer versions as I just think they look nicer. Super sturdy as I've fallen asleep with them many of times and lay on them/crushed them and they're still perfectly fine. Great for planes. I use them mostly to watch TV with, they connect seamlessly to my TV & phone.

A solid buy for me (WH-1000XM4)
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 April 2021Colour Name: BlackPattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I've been interested in these since the WHxm3 where released but always put it off due to the price, When the XM4's got released I promised myself I was going to treat myself this time round.I noticed the the xm3's was still around £230 and when these went on sale for £280 I took the leap and hit buy-now.(after watching youtube) I knew I probably wouldn't use the few extra features that these have over the xm3's like the duel connect bluetooth (as it reverts to a lower codec) but figured it was only £50 more so I bought them anyway.After charging them up downloading the phone app and powering them on I was immediately impressed with the active noise cancellation, I have experience with ANC and I'm fully aware they tend to block out lower/bass(y) sounds however these were also managing to block out some (not all) of the vocals on the film I had playing on the TV through a soundbar, Much better then the other headphones I have owned previously.* A bit of background about me, I've always struggled blocking out background noise and it is amplified when I get stressed (harder to deal with) Social anxiety, At 30 years old I was diagnosed as being on the spectrum (high functioning autism), I was introduced to active noise cancelling soon after and 11 years later I have owned so many headsets its hard to count on both hands. ANC helps me function 'normally' in environments that people take for granted, supermarkets, park(s) etc. I have never been good around people or unpredictable sounds ANC literally improved my life in so many ways (probably sounds silly to you I know).Anyway I digress (sorry). They are very comfortable I consider myself to have a large adult head and these don't clamp down to hard, The material around the cups are super soft (just wish they were user changeable when they inevitably degrade/split). I do find my ears get a little warm after a while but that's the case with most of my cans,They sound very good, I used the EQ setting in the APP and set it to a default called 'bright' and that improved them a even more (that's going to be subjective though everyone has different tastes).The APP also has a optimize ANC mode apparently it calculates air pressure, hair style if your wearing glasses and a few other things I can't remember of the top of my head, Its plays some test tones in your ears, sprinkles a little magic dust and tweaks the cans, It recommends you do this if you change your hairstyle or playing environment. I thought it to be a bit gimmicky however we have just come out of months of lockdown and I went to get my haircut before walking around (a) park, I had a few minutes walk before I remembered the feature (with just ANC on). Not sure if it was a placebo effect but I felt it did a little more (marginal) sound cancelling after the optimize.Battery life is fantastic. I've not tested it from full to dead but I did have a really active day out (well over 12 hours) and still had 70% battery remaining, I've not charged them since buying them last month (although I have been mainly using my WF-1000xm3 lately).In all fairness I prefer to be out with earbuds over cans if I have a choice, The noise cancelling isn't as good with the (WF)xm3's but that's the nature of the beast, ""cans"" are always going to do a better job than earbuds in regards to ANC.The houses around me love to party in the garden, loud music, karaoke etc and that's where the xm4's shine, It blocks out all that and allows me to blank all that out and get lost in a bubble of quietness / uninterrupted tunes / movies on my tablet whatever I feel like doing..The touch controls work as intended I find placing my thumb on the side of the can before I swipe helps limit accidental swipes (skipping instead of turning up etc).I took a call indoors and was told it was clear, no issues there. I'm yet to try it outside/in public so I cannot comment regarding that.The case is a hard-shell it's pretty compact and fits nicely in my rucksack (in the pouch next to my tablet pouch), It has a net pocket for wires on the reverse side it doesn't really stretch enough in my opinion to be useful and the charge cable has a compartment inside the case anyway.All in all it feels like a quality/premium product and fulfills my needs in every way.July 2021 edit:These also pair up fine to my Philips Ambilight Smart TV (50pus9005/12), with no issues, I've not used them to listen to live TV as I rarely watch it, I have however watched a lot of Netflix, Plex, Amazon prime etc with no sync issues.I hope this review helps you in some way. Stay safe!

Great game but not as good as ps5
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2024Verified Purchase
Hogwarts Legacy on the Nintendo Switch is an impressive port that manages to deliver a great gaming experience despite some visual downgrades and compromises. The game offers a massive open world to explore, engaging combat, and a rich storyline that fans of the Harry Potter series will love. However, the Switch version does come with some performance issues and longer loading times compared to other platforms. Nonetheless, it's an excellent way to experience Hogwarts Legacy on-the-go, and I would recommend it to any Harry Potter fan who prefers playing on the Switch.

I get this shampoo for my husband, as it is probably one of the better ones for his dry, itchy and flaky scalp. He has tried numerous different shampoos and keeps coming back to this one. I wouldn’t say it’s perfect, but it doesn’t cause any irritation which he finds with others such as Head & Shoulders.  I must admit, I don’t think the aroma is particularly pleasant, but I have a very strong sense of smell and my husband who is actually using the shampoo doesn’t have a problem with this so it’s obviously just my super sensitive nose!  The price of this shampoo can vary quite dramatically, but this seems quite reasonable, and I’ve bought it this way more than once and will and definitely do it again.

A must buy when trying to tame dry scalp or dandruff as it soothes the scalp. If it doesn't work, try switching the conditioner as the shampoo itself, has worked wonders and has fully rid me of any old scalp issues. It does however, have a chemical smell but that can be masked with a scented conditioner. The shampoo, does its job and strips the hair of any excess oils in time for the conditioner to do its part. Overall, its worth it.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2023Size Name: 250 ml (Pack of 1)Style Name: TherapeuticVerified Purchase
The area under the beard on my chin and under my nose started to get red and flakey a few years ago. It wasn't immediately noticeable but I would get flakey bits of skin on the chest of my clothing which wasn't nice, particularly if I was wearing dark colours. It would also make me itch and if I rubbed or scracthed the areas, the reddishness worsened and so does the volume of flakey skin on my clothes. Out of desperation, I bought some of this stuff in Sainsburys and, within a 3 or 4 washes the skin cleared up completely. It's miracle stuff. It works much better if you use it in the bath because you can lather up your beard and leave it for 5 minutes before rinsing. In the shower, it won't get as long on the skin to work its magic. I do it twice with every bath and the 2nd time you can really feel the tingle as the lather enters your skin. This stuff really works and it's made a huge difference to my life. It's a bit cheaper on Amazon but a bottle lasts about 3 months because you don't need a lot. If you've got itchy skin under your beard or scalp, this stuff will sort that out. It smells a bit but not once you've rinsed it off.

Not effective for me
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2024Size Name: 125 ml (Pack of 1)Style Name: TherapeuticVerified Purchase
I purchased this shampoo to help manage mild scalp psoriasis.For the price point of £7 (at time of purchase) for 250ml shampoo is a competitive price for therapeutic shampoo of this kind. The price via Amazon is generally no higher than supermarket prices.Firstly the scent is not the usual fruity fragrance scents you get from a "" normal "" shampoo. This product does smell like coal tar so please be mindful of this when buying. I personally like the smell but it may be somewhat over powering if this is your first purchase.The shampoo lathers with ease and doesn't require a lot of product to get a good coverage of the hair and scalp. I find that letting the shampoo sit for a couple of minutes provides the best results. I would recommend repeating the process more than once if you have a condition such as eczema or psoriasis. (Please note this is not a treatment for medical conditions on it's own)Once rinsed off I found that my hair felt quite dry with my scalp feeling tight, as such I needed to apply a good quality condition.After use I found that my dry skin worsened but I presume this is the shampoo loosening the dry skin. As such it did produce quite a lot of dandruff so I found it wasn't suitable for use before I was going anywhere.Although effective at easing scalp dryness and removing loose skin, the associated dandruff and itching isn't worth it for me personally so I would likely not reorder.I would neither recommend or not recommend the product as my personal experience may vastly vary to someone else's.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 March 2024Style Name: Mould SprayVerified Purchase
I bought this because of the good reviews it had, but honestly didn’t expect much. I had a lot of mould behind a wall unit I had in my bathroom due to poor ventilation, it was a mix of both black mould and brown staining right down the wall, so again I didn’t have high hopes that this would touch it. I applied it, just sprayed on and left it for 30 minutes. I came back to find the mould, the marks, the stains, vanished. I didn’t need to scrub, I just wiped over the area with a very soft sponge cloth and water (there was nothing left to wipe away). This spray just eliminated it without me having to even do anything, a rare find to get something that actually is as effective as it claims to be.It is quite potent, and very bleachy so I would recommend using gloves and even a face mask if you’re working somewhere with poor ventilation. Additionally, it comes out as a spray/fine mist so I would also encourage eye protection as I found it did get in the air, and even more so if you’re spraying high up areas like I was. The smell doesn’t linger once washed off however.Such a good product for removing mould and stains, we were shocked with how well it worked and how quickly, had I anticipated this I would have taken a before and after photo.

Excellent - It’s the only one that works!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2023Style Name: Mould SprayVerified Purchase
Having tried many, many mould sprays this is the only one that is really highly effective.I’ve used the spray on silicone sealant that I expected would require expensive replacement as dark black mould spots were present, but just a couple of applications and the mould disappeared altogether.Very deep, dark & large areas of mould which has penetrated throughout the sealant may not disappear or several applications, but will fade significantly.In addition to bathroom & kitchen sealant, I use it on discoloured grout, backs of furniture (with care not to soak, having tested an area first & not expensive/varnished items), window frames & seals, skirting boards, and bathroom/shower walls & ceilings (I don’t think it’s recommended for painted surfaces, but as no scrubbing is required it’s been absolutely fine on white emulsion-painted areas in my experience). Wherever possible I spray the area generously and leave overnight. Very deep/dark/large areas may require a second or even third application.It does have a strong chemical odour similar to strong bleach and care must be taken to protect from breathing in, spraying near eyes - especially ceilings, etc but taking common sense precautions is all that’s required e.g mask, goggles (a must if spraying at higher levels) and always ventilate the room by opening a window.I work in property management and attend many properties with condensation mould (20+ per year). This has been fantastic for dealing with mould issues quickly and easily.We also use this routinely for cleaning bathrooms (grout, sealant & ceilings) between tenancies as it saves so much time and expense as opposed to scrubbing grout with bleach and a toothbrush or worse still to remove and reapply sealant around baths, showers, basins, etc.In my own home I used to have the sealant replaced in the shower every 12-18 months. Since using this, it looks like new and keeps fresh for several years. Keeping on top of mould spots and spraying as they arise prevents the requirement for multiple applications, results are speedy and it makes one bottle last forever!I’ve only dropped one star as the product takes several hours to do its magic so further application(s) (and property visits in the case of work) might be required. The odour is significant when working with large areas of mould…but, I’m just being strict in case people are highly sensitive to the strong chemical odour or expect one squirt to perform miracles within seconds. The safety catch above the trigger is a bit fiddly but an essential safety feature for child-safety and accidents. The internal tube now needs inserting prior to first use, which again is fiddly, but a good feature to prevent the tube being damaged by the chemical if it’s left to sit in the bottle for a long time before use - as has happened in the past.These are just my own personal experiences and opinions. Hope it helps!If there was an option I’d rate it 4.5/5

Bad chemicals , good  removal
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2024Style Name: Mould SprayVerified Purchase
Works like a charm , removes even the most bad ass mold  BUT you have to take your ass out of the room and stay there like a couple of hours at least  . When you are back in the room the only thing you have to do is to leave the window open for as long as possible and maybe for days in a row because the smell doesn't go easy . This is the only issue one have to deal with.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2024Style Name: Magnet DusterVerified Purchase
If you make sure to keep the sticky substance on the fluffy fabric off your fingers this product can be made to work well and remove dust effectively.  It is a bit of a shame that the flimsy handle is difficult to insert into the fabric dusting part.  It seems efforts to keep the manufacturing cost down have precluded the provision of a simple tape through which to insert the handle.  All told, a compromised device but it does work.

A revolutionary product
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2024Style Name: Magnet DusterVerified Purchase
A friend recommended this.  I thought... gimmick... but I was totally wrong.  No matter how much you spray polish and push dust around with the alternative a micro fibre cloth this wins every time.  No sprays.  The fibres on the mop head lift every particle away.  It is amazing.  The little handle is so light and it is easy to use in those difficult to reach areas.  Of course the downside is the waste disposal of each duster but I find I can use one a few times before it is full of dust and needs to be thrown away.  I am not sure how biodegradable the dusters are.

Smartphone shopping can often be tricky terrain, where the perfect balance of performance, design, and price is hard to come by. But every once in a while, a product comes along that makes you sit up and take notice. The Google Pixel 7a is one such gem.Right from the outset, this phone feels like a steal for its price. For the bundle that includes the phone and a 30W charger, the asking price seems almost too good to be true. But rest assured, the Pixel 7a delivers on every count. Starting with performance, the Pixel 7a runs like a dream. It comes with the latest Android updates and during my time with it, not once did I encounter any freezes or lags. The experience was smooth, fluid, and incredibly satisfying.The camera is where this phone truly shines. The wide-angle lens is a photographic powerhouse that can capture stunning images with a degree of detail and colour accuracy that is nothing short of a masterpiece. Whether you're an avid photographer or someone who loves to capture life's moments on the go, this camera will not disappoint.One of the most impressive features of this bundle is the inclusion of a free 30W fast charger, as mentioned above. This charger juices up the phone rapidly, ensuring you're ready to roll in no time. Moreover, with 24-hour battery life, this phone is designed to go the distance.

Absolutely, without a hint of doubt. This is one of the best Android phones I've tested in this price range, and it sets the bar high for other smartphones in the market.

A fantastic budget phone
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2023Colour: CharcoalStyle Name: Pixel 7aVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )Verified Purchase
£449 for a brand new phone is uncommon in these times. So it's right to be sceptical.Quick summary:Pros:- OLED 6.1"" Front Screen - carries the Google quality. Unrivalled full HD, far better contrasts, colour saturation than typical LED screens found in similar phones in this price range.- Pixel standard, high quality cameras. Good quality sensors combined with Google's software makes for a well utilised combo delivering above-average camera ability for the price tag.- 4K Rear Video recording (albeit at 30FPS, this is still great to have).- Night sight is phenomenal to have on a phone of this price. Offers a great solution to very dim settings.- Ultra-wide Rear Camera - Great for amateur photographers.- Magic Eraser. Worked great, touched up photos in seconds.- 7.5W Wireless Charging! Ideal for on-the-go.- 5G & 4G Support.- Fantastic battery life. Lasted a day of average use for me easily.- Phone hardware feels well utilised with the software - offering a smooth experience.- Smoothness is promoted by lovely 90Hz screen refresh rate.- IP67 Waterproof - no need to worry about water damage due to dust/rain.- Comfortable in hand.- More premium design than 6A predecessor.- In-screen finger print scanner is responsive & haven't encountered any issues.- Face ID worked no issues, but found finger print to be quicker.- Years of software & security support.Cons:- No SD card expansion.- Charging speeds of 18W Wired & 7.5W Wireless are quite slow.- Screen brightness suffers in daylight.- Quite large bezels around the screen.- No headphone jack (could be considered negligible by some).- £50 more expensive on release than 6A predecessor.- Glossy plastic back attracts scratches.- No adaptive refresh option, can either be set at 60Hz or 90Hz.--Overall, the pixel 7A offers a fantastic option for a budget phone with some particular features being the camera, the classic Pixel standout, being a key reason for choice over other phones. Benefit of going Google with your phone choice is the utilisation of the hardware by the software and this is something you don't have to worry about as it comes with years of future updates & support. A popular Google feature is the Magic Eraser and this comes with the 7A although it's noted you may have to perform a software update if it does not appear straight away for you.The battery life is phenomenal, probably helped by the software, and lasted a day of typical use with ease. For lighter use cases, you can definitely see it stretching few days. I recommend choosing the Google Pixel Charger bundle as the charging speeds aren't fantastic to begin with and would not want to risk going any slower with a 3rd party charging option.The display is OLED, full HD and offers a great experience for the 6.1"" screen size. The display has refresh options of 60Hz & 90Hz, the latter will reduce your battery life but improve the user experience so really up to your use case. Drawback of the display is the bezels which go around the edges of the screen which for me, age it a little but found I don't take much notice of it when I'm actively using the phone.What I'm most let down by is the lack of storage expansion. 128Gb quickly fills up and means you must rely on cloud storage, especially for photos. This will begin as free but might start costing you monthly as time progresses.In conclusion, this is a great budget phone, with some drawbacks as you expect for the price-point. The display and camera technology is unmatched for the money and benefits of Google software really shows when it comes to the fluidity of the experience.

The quality feel all round is pleasing, instantly impressing.  Transfer from my old phone was fast and easy.  Wireless charging works well and apps are better connected and work flawlessly, unlike my old android 12.Battery life is ok but it is heavily loaded being used all day for work with multiple apps and lots of calls.Charging speed is ok too, conected wirelessly in the car most of the time but fast charge via cable works well.Camera is great but won't get much use as it isn't a feature I need very often but does scan reciepts very clearly with Xero-Me app.So far, I'm impressed and although only 128Gb, I don't see myself needing more in the forseeable future.This is a Mid-Budget phone with High-Budget quality.

Especially if you are still using an original Xbox One, the performance gap between that and this is phenomenal. Sure there aren’t a lot of new games out at the minute - which is the only real downside, however there are plenty of games that are optimised for use with the console that exist already, and I’d assume that we will see more AAA titles being released as the world gets moving again... I’d definitely recommend getting this console down to the sheer performance and quality alone, you will not be disappointed!EDIT: (After 40 Days of Usage) This review is still fully accurate of my opinion on this console, it performs like a beast, it’s pretty much silent under load, I’ve been having a blast playing COD at 120fps on it and I’ve clocked about 300 hours so far with no issues, what a great piece of kit!

Fast load times and almost silent
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2020Style Name: Series X - Standard EdVerified Purchase
Personally, I like the design of the Series X as I have a black TV cabinet so it blends in and doesn't stand out. I can understand why people think it looks boring or ""like a refrigerator"" but I like it. If you like a fancy, show-off design then you may be disappointed. The only downside in my opinion is that it looks rubbish when it's lay on its side, which I have to do as it is ever so slightly too tall to fit in my TV cabinet vertically. The round stand on the bottom is not removable either so it is visible when lying down.When you boot the Series X, although the Xbox start-up logo is new, the User Interface is not. It's the same UI as the Xbox One. As a tech enthusiast, I enjoy exploring a new UI or OS to see what's new and different but for many people that is a chore. Microsoft made the decision to make the transfer from Xbox One to Series X|S as seamless as possible and that makes sense as most people will just want to turn the Xbox on and get into their favourite game as fast as possible.The SSD that Microsoft has put in the Series X|S is really fast. From powered off the console boots in seconds and can launch a game in a few seconds more. For comparison, I booted Red Dead Redemption 2 on my old Xbox One and it took 2:48 to go from Xbox Dashboard to playing the game. On the Series X, it took 0:38 seconds. Navigating the Xbox Dashboard is now lag-free compared to the Xbox One.The SSD is labelled as 1TB but there is 802GB of usable space. This is a result of two things; the OS installation and the difference between what the OS and the storage manufacturers call a gigabyte. To the OS, 1GB = 1,073,741,824 bytes whereas storage manufacturers state that 1GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes. The difference is roughly 70MB per GB.If you have a USB hard drive, you can still use it to play any Xbox, Xbox 360 or Xbox One games but you won't benefit from the faster load times. Personally, I use it as mass storage as moving a game from my USB drive to the internal SSD is faster than downloading it. Any game that is Series X|S optimised can only be played from the internal SSD or the Seagate Expansion Card that slot in the back of the console. Microsoft have made it easy to identify which games are X|S Optimised as the have a big, white X|S logo over the game icon.When in use, the Series X is extremely quiet. I don't even think I've heard the console apart from the start-up chime (which can be disabled in Settings). I've read reports of the console getting hot but I have not experienced this. Yes, it gets warm when it's in use, but this is normal for any piece of technology whether it's an Xbox, a phone, a tablet or a TV. As long as the top of the console is not obstructed, the heat will be dispersed.The controller has been slightly redesigned as well. It has retained the same shape but now has a grippier texture on the back and the shoulder buttons and triggers now have a matte finish. The triggers also have the grippy texture that is on the back of the console. I wasn't sure if I'd like this at first but after an hour or so, I got used to it and now prefer it to my Xbox One controllers (which will work with the Series X|S). The controller also has a share button which when pressed takes a screenshot, and takes a recording when held. It's not ground-breaking stuff, but it's a nice addition.In the box is a 14-day trial of Game Pass Ultimate, which, in my opinion, is currently the best deal in gaming. You get access to a library of over 100 games and with the launch of Series X|S you also get access to EA Play. It also includes Xbox Game Pass for PC and Xbox Live Gold Membership allowing you to play online and receive free games through the Games With Gold promotion. Any new game made by Microsoft Studios or a studio owned by Microsoft is available through Games Pass the day it releases.My biggest complaint is the storage space. With games getting bigger and bigger as resolutions increase, 1TB (802GB usable space) is simply not enough. I installed 5 games and was already using more than 75% onf the internal SSD.My other complaint would be that there should be more USB ports. There are 3 USB-A ports (two on the back and one on the front). I have a USB hard drive, and USB receiver for my headset and a charging dock for my controllers connected. I would have like Microsoft to have included a USB-C port as they are becoming more common, and that is what my headset receiver uses (without the need for an adapter).Overall, I love my Series X and it is a huge improvement from the Xbox One. Even though the OS is the same and navigating the menus doesn't feel new, every game looks better and loads faster and at the end of the day, that's all that really matters, right?

Enjoyable game and no scoring required
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 September 2021Verified Purchase
Had been considering buying this for a long time and am pleased I decided to get it in the end!  It arrived the next day with Prime, as promised.  I've taken a few snaps of the rules in case it helps anyone decide whether they might enjoy it.  It's a very simple game to learn and I particularly liked that there's no writing down scores on paper for anyone, which can be a bit of a chore with some games.  I also like that the board has reminders about the purpose of one and two eyed Jacks, plus you get a couple of spare playing cards with an explanation of how to play the Jacks too.So far I've only played it as a two player game and it worked fine.  Basically you get dealt a number of cards each.  The number of cards dealt depends on how many are playing (but for 2 players it's 7 cards each).  On the board each card is pictured twice except the Jacks which are excluded from the board (the pack you're drawing from consists of 2 packs of cards).  The object is to place your chip on one of the two cards on the board which match a card in your hand, discard the card and take the next one off the top of the pack.  Strategy comes in to play as the game progresses because you're also trying to get 5 of your chips in a straight line up, down, across, or diagonally on the board but you need the right cards to help you do this.  When you get a line of 5 chips it's called a Sequence and you need to score two of them on the board to win the game.  There are a few extra rules, such as the Jacks are used to either remove one of your opponent's chips from the board or they allow you to place one of your chips anywhere on the board (depending on whether the Jack has one or two eyes).  My other half often beats me at other games, and whilst I don't mind losing it gets a bit one-sided and is nice to win sometimes.  It's early days yet but so far I've found with this game I've managed to win some, because as well as strategy it also relies on an element of chance because if you don't have the right cards in your hand you can't lay your chips where you want to in order to make a line.I'm not sure the stated dimensions of the product in this description are correct but can confirm that the box measures 27cm tall x 20cm wide x 6.5cm deep.  The board folds twice and measures 51.5cm x 38cm when open.  Enjoyable game and recommended even by a non-card player!

Purchased this game a few years ago and it's still enjoyed as much now as it was then. We get Sequence out at the beginning of December and literally play it daily until the end of the Christmas season. Not sure why we don't play it during the rest of the year!It's a really good game that is enjoyed by everyone. Quite strategic and very addictive. You won't be disappointed with your purchase.

As good as ever!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 April 2014Verified Purchase
Beware if you take this anywhere to play, everyone will be asking for one!We first found this game in Greece decades ago. Bought one as a present for family, then others requested it. So we had quite a trade going from Greece to the UK for it. Eventually all our folks had it so everyone plays. We mostly have girls v boys. Kids of all ages can play - the very young can help, the strategy part is beyond them though.Our various Greek relatives have suddenly become interested in playing it. We lent them ours with the promise of bying them a new set. Would you believe it? You cannot buy this in Greece any more! So we ordered the first of several in the other direction. We must have had ours for 20 years and it was, until lent to the kids this summer, in great condition. Will be interesting to see how long their new one lasts, slightly different colouring but otherwise the same.Anyone we have played it with has loved it, no two games are ever the same. And we never play just one game, ever. We have played well into the night on summer's eves. Simple to play, difficult to master (largely bacuse you can never remember where anything is, and spades are often difficult to distinguish from clubs, yep they are!). Very entertaining, and of course everyone loves chucking someone else off the board!I'd purchase again in a heartbeat.

Disappointing quality of materials
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 October 2020Verified Purchase
Disappointed that the quality is poor compared to the set we borrowed from friends to try it out. Theirs was a recent purchase - not an early edition.. You would think - having sold ""over 10 million copies"" that they would be able to spend some of their profits improving the quality. The one we borrowed was tactile and - although simple - worth the £20 we paid as it is an enjoyably addictive game. The new counters are cheaper plastic and the cards flimsier. We're still happy with our purchase as we like the game but the excitement is tarnished slightly by the quality...

Brilliant Game
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2021Verified Purchase
Update:  Now my 4th purchase of this game for family after telling them how good it is & sending to them direct.  Everyone phoned to say what an absolutely brilliant game and all love it.Purchased as we wanted a  new game for two players & this is a brilliant game for 2 or 4 or 6 or 8 people.We have played as 2 player and with our grown up children who are still at home and everyone loves it. At first it may appear to look confusing but within minutes you get the hang of it and we are all hooked.  Whilst we have a whole cupboard of games as we are all avid game players this has been the first choice since purchased.  We are buying another one for one of the kids who is moving out soon and wants to have this game.  Highly recommend.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2019Verified Purchase
We saw a group of holidaymakers playing this and having lots of fun.  They take it on all their holidays and recommended it, so we decided to purchase it and have not been dissappointed.  An easy to learn game for all ages and the folding board, which is of good quality, makes it ideal to pack. There are two decks of cards and counters which are groups of three colours.  The basic principle is similar to Connect 4, but you need to make a line of 5 counters on the board. You can play individually or in teams.  All the contents are made of good quality materials.  I can recommend this product.

Use after each feed, r even before, doesn't disturb baby feed, not had any problems with having cream on with feeding, actually help baby lips too, no odor or taste.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2024Size Name: 100 ml (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I'm a recent convert to snail serum.  Once you are over the yuk factor and have done some research, its well worth a go.  The first one I used was given to me free to try.  I really liked the effect it had but was not so keen on the aroma, although it did quickly disappear once applied.  So I decided to have a look at some of the other serum's on the market.I settled on trying this COSRX based on other reviews which are almost all unanimously good, none of which mentioned anything about a smell and my decision to try it was also helped by the fact that it was on offer at the time.I'm not disappointed.  It is clear (rather than a cloudy opaque like my original) and has no aroma that I can detect whilst still giving the lovely smooth nourished feel to my skin.  I'm sold - this is my go-to from now on.

I I'd give this a try after reading about it and doing a little research. The price was a distinct advantage as a lot of skin products are costly. I layered it over my usual serum then added my moisturiser. Straight away I noticed my skin had a lovely healthy glow and my skin felt very moisturised. I’m on day 3 now and completely hooked! Someone mentioned today that I had a healthy glow, so not my imagination! When I’m done with the moisturiser I’m currently using, I’m certainly going to be giving the matching moisturiser a go.

It's fun to play with just two people as well as lots more.  The game takes a sensible amount of time to play, not too long, nor too short, though the fewer the number of players the quicker will be the game time.  It definitely doesn't drag on like the old board game.

I like it alot, purchased it here on amazon, not via Samsung as they didn't have any left in stock as does anywhere else.

Great, except for the screen...
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2024Size Name: 256GBStyle Name: S22 UltraColour: BlackVerified Purchase
First the good. Samsung get a lot right - most things in fact. Great software and things that generally work. However, there are 2 things about this phone that would make me think twice about buying it (or other Samsung phones) again. And they are all screen related.1. Fingerprint sensor locationThe fingerprint sensor is on the screen. This is here purely for Samsung to show off, but subsequently they are trading flare for functionality. It doesn't even work as well as the OnePlus sensor from years ago, because the OnePlus sensor isn't on the screen (it's on the back). This means that if you use a screen protector, the Samsung sensor probably won't work.2. Screen hardnessUnfortunately, as well, while the S22 U screen is made of gorilla glass, its Moh value is relatively low, meaning that, without the protector, it scratches REALLY easily. OnePlus screens (certainly older ones such as the OnePlus 2) are significantly harder.3. Screen shapeAnother way Samsung shows off is with how their screens have curved edges. However, all this means is that the on-screen image gets distorted at the edge. What's the point of extra screen if that extra is poorer quality, diminishing the quality of the whole.Having lived with it for a while, I wouldn't not buy a curved screen, as it doesn't ruin the experience, but if the choice was between 2 identical phones except for the curved screen, the flat one would win hands down.Basically, Samsung is trying to show off, but I would prefer if they just did a good job.

Quantum leap!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 June 2020Style Name: 32 GB Wi-Fi + Free mobile connectivityColour: GraphiteOffer Type: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase
I bought this Oasis 3 to replace my trusty 6-year old Paperwhite which had gotten a bit laggy and slow (like its owner).  An earlier reviewer had said it made for a whole new reading experience, which I thought was a pretty tall order - until I got my own.It is amazing, a real quantum leap from the Paperwhite.  It’s lighter, thinner and the nifty ergonomic design of the back means it’s very comfortable to hold.  The slightly bigger and squarer screen makes more difference than you would believe: it really does alter the whole experience. I actually feel I’m reading a proper book, and not a tablet: it’s much more enjoyable and I find I get lost in a book now, which I never really did with the PW.  (Which I can’t face using again now, the difference is that great.)The screen too is clearer (not matt, like the Paperwhite) and crisper.  It’s a real quality screen. Plus it has the added bonus of the warm light option, which is nice if your eyes are tired and you want a softer tone. You can also schedule the warmth to come on automatically at sunset and off at dawn, so you automatically get a warmer tone for night-time reading.  Clever stuff.As well as the touch screen - whoopee, it also has page turn buttons which are situated on the right hand side just where you hold it, so within fingertip reach.  Everything is very quick and responsive, and downloading only takes a jiff.Battery life - hmm, I never believe what it says on the tin anyway when it comes to these claims. I’ve not had it long enough to really put it to the test, but with airplane mode on, brightness at 15 bars and warmth at 5, and reading 1-2 hours a day, I’d say the battery isn’t lasting nearly as long as the PW but it’s not exactly disgracing itself either. Doubt it would last for weeks (but then how long is a piece of string?  All depends on how you use it) but as I top my devices up regularly anyway that doesn’t bother me.I bought the 32g with 4g, 32 being far too many giggies for my use but irritatingly it was the only version which offered both WiFi and 4g, and that flexibility’s always been a must for me.  It’s meant I can download new books in the most unlikely places.  I teamed it with a decent screen protector and the posh red fabric smart cover (overpriced but very nice) and now I can swank all over town with it.  Or could, if we weren’t still in lockdown.  Maybe I can wave it out the window and make the neighbours jealous.So, lovely Amazon peeps - stay safe, stay well, and if you need a lockdown treat then this is just the job. It really is that good.

Superb! As a gadget-lover I was delighted to receive my new Kindle Oasis a couple of weeks ago and am thoroughly enjoying getting to know it.I was initially put-off this Kindle when it first appeared on the scene, as the asymmetry did not appeal to my eyes and my Paperwhite was behaving very well.However, I'm already totally smitten.Yes, the front perhaps does strike the eye as unbalanced, but the feel is wonderful.Having owned numerous Kindles since they first broke into the world of great gadgets, starting with a Keyboard Kindle, then Paperwhite, HDX, Kindle Fire 7,  Voyage and the All New Paperwhite (and maybe I've missed one or two along the way?)....you could say I'm a fan.One of the brand new additions to the Oasis hugely appealed and that's the warm lighting. It's great. I read in bed every night and always use the black/white reversal option, so as to not disturb my sleeping husband. The Oasis allows both! White on black AND warmth, leaving me reading in a glow of amber, rather than bluey-white. Very easy on the eyes!Also, finally it's back, the text to speech option, this was missed out on the most recent Paperwhite, saving having to buy audio books if I want to be read to!I like the slightly larger screen and the reversable page-turn buttons, as well as a fully functioning/swipe touch screen. More fonts/sizes are justified, when this option is chosen.Merlot leather covernicely compliments the Oasis. What a shame though, that the only option which includes ""free"" 4g is the 32g, graphite one. Would have loved the gold version.Bliss too that the waterproof feature applies to this Kindle. What a bonus again!Would have preferred to be able to take out extra warranty. Sadly, no longer available via Amazon. Amazon suggested trying Squaretrade, (a previously used insurer for other kindles in the past.) I'm still intending to do this if I can.I was a little concerned that the left hand/right hand either way up, would be a problem as there's no option to turn it off, however, there's no problem there at all.Fab gadget. Charges really quickly and lasts as long time, even for an avid reader like me.Very pleased. Well done, again, Amazon. Best Kindle yet.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2023Item Package Quantity: 1Verified Purchase
I don’t know why some reviewers say gluten free bread doesn’t work. I tried the Warburtons gluten free thins (with banana and nutella), 5-10 min in the airfryer (yes of course without the actual plastic Crimpit as it would melt). Yum. Sealed well at the edges too. I don’t keep breads in the fridge which might make the difference here? I also made my kid’s sandwiches (not toasted) today as she always leaves her crusts. I made these with our regular sliced half/half factory bread. A bit of ham with wiped cucumber (with kitchen roll to dry some of the juice off to stop sogginess) and another one with ham and a bit of lettuce. Crimped in seconds and the crusts came right off. (I might start collecting those in the freezer to make breadcrumbs now that I am dealing with clean crusts lol). I pressed the bread a bit flat with a spoon first to make it thinner which took all of a second. Neat little pocket of sandwich which then slotted nicely in those reusable silicone ziplock food pouches. Eco points for mum on two counts! (Except of course for buying a plastic gadget in the first place but not throwing crusts out every day and not using foil or plastic wrap should hopefully all help over time). We’ll see if she likes the taste but I am looking forward to receiving her lunchbag without the usual nibbled crusts today! All in all highly recommended for mums, and people who are bored of gluten free sandwiches. I agree the price is very high for a bit of plastic but I guess that’s what you get if you buy the latest gadget craze. It’s very sturdy but could/should be half the price.

Dear CRIMPiT where have you been all my life?
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 February 2024Item Package Quantity: 1Verified Purchase
🥪 This is a review for The CRIMPiT - A toastie maker for Thins - Make toasted snacks in minutes - Healthy toasted snacks - Designed especially to work with low-calorie Thin bread.⚠️ Please do not put any part of the plastic CRIMPiT in the toaster, air fryer or any other appliance or heat source that may melt the PLASTIC. 🤦‍♂️ It crimps bread it doesn't defy the laws of physics.📦 The item came well packaged in a cardboard envelope. Inside was a presentation box and the CRIMPiT itself.Things I like:✔️ Nicely presented in a box with an instruction and a recipe card.✔️ There's a QR code inside which takes you to a page where you can view some more recipes, which is a nice little added bonus.✔️ Easy enough to use, though sometimes you do have to use a bit of pressure to get the bread crimped correctly.✔️ As long as you don't inadvertently melt the CRIMPiT it's easy enough to clean, there should only ever really be some dropped filling or breadcrumbs, which can easily be wiped off.✔️ CRIMPiT has confirmed that this item is BPA-free and uses non-toxic plastics.✔️ The CRIMPiT is dishwasher (but not toaster) safe.✔️ When used correctly, it makes delicious toasted thins, it feels like you're eating a toastie.✔️ CRIMPiT sent an email following a purchase with advice on how to use it, including to reiterate that you shouldn't put this in the toaster, this was a nice little touch as well, it's nice to see something like this when a business goes out of their way to say thank you.Things I don't like:❌ This is not necessarily the fault of CRIMPiT but some bread thins are uneven and don't fit correctly, which means you may have to trim the edges to get it to fit in the (what I like to call crimp zone).❌ Sometimes does need a lot of pressure, so if you have particularly weak upper body strength, you may need some help getting crimpy with it.The bottom line:🔻 If you're looking for a healthier alternative to toasties you make in a toastie machine, this may be for you. Bear in mind, however, that this crimps the side of bread, it's not groundbreaking, it's not some amazing technology it's literally some plastic grooves.This quickly and easily prepares thins for you so you can toast or air fry them to golden brown perfection. We've used both 50/50 and white thins and they both work a treat, and I imagine wholemeal will work just as perfectly as well. This is great and does exactly what it says it does.4/5 - A great product!

Do Not put this in the toaster/air fryer
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 January 2023Item Package Quantity: 1Verified Purchase
I have read reviews where users have complained that their Crimpit has melted when they put it into their air fry machine and of course, it would because it is not meant to go inside an air fryer or toaster or any other cooking device. Read the instructions and you find that this Crimpit is designed to create a sealed parcel of two slices of bread enclosing some filling ready to be taken out of the Crimpit and put into the toaster or air fryer for cooking. It does that well. I have been using bread thins from a well-known producer of all things bakery bought from my local supermarket. No crusts and as the name says not such a thick cut. I have not done anything complicated yet, just cheese and sweet pickle but the result has been most satisfying with the toaster giving faster results.  A toasted sandwich-maker could enable you to use standard bread loaf and deep fill but it takes up more space and is a nightmare to store and clean. The crimping does rely on a bit of brute force as you press down on your creation to make the seal and it is important you make the seal form well or you will have melted ingredients spilling out into your cooking device. If that is a toaster, that could be messy. The Crimpit is a great, simple idea that works amazingly well.

It makes toastie making simple and requires virtually no cleaning but it's just two pieces of plastic that hardly justifies the price. I'm afraid the constant offers a rather reminiscent of the DFS sale. Does anyone play full price for this? Just set a fair and reasonable price and quit with the fake offers

Some downloads will play embedded subtitles but some don't (I haven't figured out which, or why, yet!) and although you can install VLC media play on it, you can't adjust the aspect ratio in VLC on fire?! So you either have to put up with a stretched picture or no subs!Streaming works flawlessly, and it linked up wirelessly to my Majority Soundbar without a hitch (though I did have to do a factory reset after 2 weeks because the audio from the blu ray on HDMI just stopped working!

 TV was delivered today so this review may change. Video quality is fantastic with a great amount of settings to change it to your taste. Audio quality is very full, doesn't tear at high volume and has good base. Setup was quick and easy. The selection of apps is great and linking them was easy using phone. Arrived in perfect condition without a scratch on the box. My only complaints so far are : The screws are very hard to get into the legs. When trying to control the Tv very quickly it does lag but sorts itself out very quickly. I couldn't think of anything you will get more value for money, especially if purchased on Amazon day for a discounted price.Edit Feb 24 - TV still works great, no issue and no fall in product quality. I have had maybe 2 or 3 technical issues with the Tv, all involving Apple AirPlay connection (could be an apple problem)

Easy set up, crystal clear 4k, easy to navigate remote controlOnly negative is that if you are using the standard home screen (and not a device attached to an HDMI port) there is no way to adjust the screen resolution so using the built in apps such as iplayer or netflix the resolution is not 4k and appears almost blurry or out of focus, but once app is selected it'll then use the apps own pre-selected resolution (example being that the best video quality on netflix is controlled by your netflix sub)  complicated way of saying it, but fix the home screen to look clearer, please Amazon :)

Great TV
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 September 2023Size Name: 43 InchVerified Purchase
The quality of this tv is excellent, until now I’ve been using a HD tv and the upgrade to 4K is amazing. Everything else about the tv is good quality as well, it has 4 HDMI ports which is nice and one of them is arc so I can use my soundbar with it. It has an option for a stand and a wall mount which is good. A lot of reviews have been saying that the UI is a bit slow but I don’t think it is, I think it depends on the Wi-Fi speed, I have plugged my Ethernet cable into the back of it so it is getting a fast gigabit connection, with that speed internet the user interface is very smooth. It also supports HDR which I love but I have to turn it off for some things like playing GTA on my Xbox, it doesn’t look that good, actually makes it worse but I can just turn it off for that use, not a problem. The size and weight of the tv is good, not too heavy for a bracket. It also looks good with the bezels not being too big. The remote with the Alexa feature is excellent, being able to switch HDMI sources with your voice is incredible.

A 55 inch 4k TV for £379? (at the time of purchase) Hmmm ok I thought to myself, it ain't going to be great at that price but it will get me over Xmas and new year.How wrong was I? Picture quality is brilliant. Colours vibrant, clear, sharp & on point. Brightness is great, even in direct sunlight and sound, whilst not brilliant, is loud and clear (doesn't matter to me, I use an AV setup)All in all, this TV beats the 3 year old 43in Samsung (which cost almost 3 times more) it has replaced, hands down!!If I had to find one fault, the menus aren't the fastest but as it's pretty much used as a monitor for Sky Q and for some light gaming, that doesn't matter to me.Imho, at this price point, it is unbeatable.

This one was both and it is far better than another recent slightly cheaper Android TV I had bought. I also prefer this to an LG TV I own.Great picture, sound and easy to set up. Responsive interface and no crashing apps which I experienced on the Android TV. The controller is a good subtle evolution of the older Fire stick I own.

Still amazing!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 August 2017Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
(Introduction)The Xbox 360 controller is exceptional, it requires double A batteries. It comes in white or black, not a wide variety of colours but at least you have a choice between two. Once turned on a green LED light starts flashing. If the controller runs out of power just replace the batteries, very simple.(Setting up)To set up the Xbox 360 Controller all you need to do is first power the controller on; to do that hold down the Xbox button and then a green flashing LED light should appear. You also should turn on the Xbox 360. At the top of the Xbox 360 Controller, there should be a small clickable button, press that then the controller and the Xbox should be flashing but the lights should be flashing in a circle. Then your Xbox controller and your Xbox 360 Console should be connected. I do know that you can use the controller for PC MAC, as I tried to do so myself. However, I was using a MAC and installed the software then tried to use it sadly it didn’t work, pity. By the way, you do have to use a wired controller or use the wireless receiver for windows, not for MAC. I will rate the setting up a 7/10, very easy on the Xbox 360. Personally, hard to setup on PC.(Product design)The product design is admirable, here are all the components on the Xbox 360 Controller:-A button-B button-Y button-X button-The Xbox button-The D pad-The analog sticks-The Left bumper-The right bumper- The left trigger-The right trigger-The connection button-The start button-The back button.The A, B, Y and X button, unfortunately, it has no satisfying click. More like a soft and silent button. Personally, I like the satisfying click that buttons have to offer- like the connection button. The click is far more superior than most buttons on the Xbox 360 Controller. The D pad feels loose and has a soft click like the A, B, Y and X button, so isn’t noisy and isn’t satisfying, unfortunately. The analog sticks feel rubbery but I quite like the feeling, it has a nice texture. When you click the analog sticks it is loud and satisfying, it has a good strong click suitable for my standards. The left and right bumper have a strong click; like clicking the analog sticks, it is satisfactory to my standards. The left and right trigger flick loudly when pressed down and let go of. The start, back and Xbox button all feel soft, like most of the Xbox 360 controller for once though it is a nice change to feel something soft rather than something clickable and strong. The start and back button are rather plain and have nothing to offer, while the Xbox button has a green LED button that looks nice and peaceful. I like how it has a nice light. I rate the product design a 6/10. Personally, the soft clickable buttons aren’t my preference but that’s just me.(The Build quality)The build quality of this product is passible, the casing for the controller strong. Bearing in mind that it is an old controller, so Microsoft probably didn’t have as strong materials as they do now. I have dropped it a couple but after a few drops, the scratching was not too severe. While I was playing FIFA I did get a little bit annoyed and threw the controller at a wall, twice actually. The first time it didn’t break however it did on the second throw, well kind of. Parts of it came off but still usable, so actually impressive! I will rate the build quality an 8/10, really good, surprisingly.(The Conclusion)In conclusion, this product is a robust, strong controller it definitely can survive being thrown at a wall twice; when raged in FIFA. The components of the controller have a soft silent click, so when gaming the sounds from the controller don’t distract you. This controller in 2017 is still relevant and is still a number #1 best seller on amazon (in joysticks.)! It just goes to show how many people play Xbox 360 or use this controller for their PC. The setting up on the controller is quick and easy, however, I did struggle setting up on PC. Personally, I believe this product is an 9/10, still awesome! The only bad thing is the price and that’s it! I appreciate you reading my review!

Wireless controller for Xbox 360
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2011Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I bought this for my son as a replacement for his original controller which attached to the console with a cable. He often games with friends and the cables got in the way and limited where they sat in relation to the xbox console.  This wireless controller gives his more freedom of choice.There seems to be a decent range with this controller which is good as he often sits a fair distance away from the xbox console and TV.  He hasn't noticed any degredation in signal or control even if he is halfway across the room.The black plastic casing looks great and contrasts well with the coloured buttons on the right-hand side.The game controller is comfortable to hold and relatively lightweight so he finds it ideal for long play sessions. It is well made, all of the buttons and controls move freely with no sticking or stiffness.  The bottom and top half of the controller fit together well, there are no loose areas and no rough plastic on which to catch your hands.My son says that using the controller makes it so much easier to control actions in first person shooter games and he can react to sudden suprises way faster than other controllers he has tried.  He often plays against three other friends who all use the same controller - there is never any interference between them.So overall, a definite improvement over the cabled version.

Bought the GOLD one as an upgrade controller, and to use with a pc and wireless dongle
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2013Verified Purchase
I bought this as the ""improved"" version Xbox controller to use with my pc.It looks very nice in gold and the D digital feels a bit better than my old 360 controller. But apart from that, for a new pad it didn't feel as improved as I expected it to. Not bad, but I obviously expected too much of it.Still I needed a new pad and this one does look and feel very nice.N.B. After having given it a LOT of use I actually came to appreciate this pad much more than I did at first. It is a far better controller than the original 360 pad.It's a pity the new Xbox One controllers apparently don't work the same with pc's as the old ones did!Update 7 October 2015.I actually bought the gold coloured one of these pads, but I am sure they are identical, obviously apart from the colour, which makes it so difficult to understand why it is that some colours are as much as twice the price for ONLY this difference?The point of this edit though is that last week, almost 2 years since I bought that gold pad, the chrome D pad cross just broke off while in use. It has done normal daily gaming and not been harshly treated or frequently dropped but there you go. I don't know if they are prone to that, if it is a stress build up on the joint through use or what, but there is a small broken hole in the middle of the cross where it it has detached and four little plastic locating lugs underneath, but I cant 't think of any way to fix it in a useful way because any bodge will just become unglued again quickly.Up until that point I was very happy with it, definitely the best pad I've owned, so sadly I will have to buy another one. Just under two years is I suppose a FAIRLY reasonable length of time for use and I did use it almost every day, frequently for several hour sessions at a time.I will buy another one the same type, except I WILL NOT pay eighty odd quid for a gold one. At that price I wouldn't have regarded the broken one as good value. I have a couple of black original Xbox 360 controllers several years older, which do still work ok and are not actually broken, but you have to press hard on nearly ALL the buttons, or press them more than once sometimes because obviously the contacts or 'springiness' has worn down, but they have been very durable, whatever other faults they have.So just that word of warning before some of you maybe pay far too much just for the pretty gold coloured ones, it makes no difference to play, so it's a chrome black or purple one for me, whichever is around the 40 quid mark.I'm currently waiting impatiently for the delivery of the new Steam controller next month anyway, so I'm hoping for great things from that, especially since the price has now dropped before release to the entirely reasonable £39.99 as opposed to that also being first advertised as costing around the 80 quid mark, which I WAS going to pay.However you play, happy gaming people.

A+++++ Fantastic Battery Life at 100% for a refurbed iPhone that looks like brand new.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 March 2020Verified Purchase
This is a big jump for me and it’s taken a bit of getting used too with no home button. A day spent with your new phone though and you’ll be a seasoned pro!It came very well packaged with original apple Charing cable (white) with a black USB plug. The cable is not even a metre so if you’re wanting a long lead to reach to your side board it might not do.I checked the battery health and it’s at 100% for it being refurbed and in all honestly it looks and was packaged as brand new, works like brand new too.The battery on this phone is a powerful. I charged it to capacity 24 hours ago and it’s not even 24 hours later and it’s no where needing charged. And that was me listening to podcasts all through the night (as you do!).All round the camera quality is far superior. And when I said I jumped, I went up from a 6S to an XR so anything was better than my previous brick.All around amazing 😉 phone and so glad I went for this. For those or you worried about buying refurbed products don’t be, the only one owner prior to you has had it not that long, there’s not a single scratch and as I said battery lives range from 80%. My iPhone 8 had 87% and my XR has 100% and it’s literally Like brand new so for anyone considering buying refurbed items and thinking they’ll be scratched etc don’t be. It comes like Brand new. I’ve had phones and TV’s all refurbed, cracking models, no defects for a fraction of that cost.

good honest review for the iPhone XR
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 June 2021Verified Purchase
I've had this phone for just over 3 weeks, it arrived on the 13th May. I ordered an iPhone XR BLACK 64GB. what I had when I initially opened the packaging ( the packaging is clean, no damage, the phone is super safe and well wrapped ) was a BLUE! iPhone XR. An entirely different color to what I ordered. now normally people would send it back, but I needed a phone and I don't really have the time to send it back, to then be refunded 5-7 business days after they received it to re-purchase in the correct color. it should've been CORRECT the first time around. But even though I hated the color, I decided to just keep it and see if it would grow on me. I still hate it.Now, onto the phone quality:the phone itself had 0 noticeable scratches on it, looked completely brand new, fresh out of an Apple store. for £310, it's worth the amount you save instead of getting one from Apple. The screen has been ""iPhone screen ghosting"" ( search it up on google if you don't understand ) which is very annoying as the only way it fixes itself sometimes, is if you lock the screen then open it again, or leave your phone for a few minutes. In some cases, I've turned the phone off and back on which for the standard they claim there offering, shouldn't happen at all. something must be faulty on the inside for it to be so inconsistent with screen recognition. Finally. the face recognition, mine has worked 85% + of the time. with the exceptions sometimes I might have not had myself in the perfect position for it to recognize me. Not many issues with that but definitely have been a few weird moments where it should've worked and didn't. Don't know if that's down to the technology itself or just the phone refurbishment.Now the final section, the battery lifeUpgrading from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone XR. the difference is crazy, my previous phone would be dead inside a time of 90minutes on low screen brightness and on power mode. but on this phone, the battery life can literally last me all day. as I work from home at my desk, I'm not on it 24/7 so some days I forget to charge it and have enough to use it the next day. I'm not much of a phone person, I probably have 30ish hours of screentime a week which isn't a lot compared to other people my age. having upwards of nearly 100+hours. Battery life is 4.5/5 for me

Great Tablet, Great Value
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 August 2023Style Name: Fire HD 10Digital Storage Capacity: 64 GBConfiguration: with AdsColour Name: DenimVerified Purchase
My 1st ever tablet was from that popular 'fruity' company. (Not sure if reviews allow you to name rival companies - Im sure you can guess who it is) Cost me a small fortune and went out of date less than a year of buying it. Vowed never to buy a tablet from them again. Grossly over priced.This is my first Amazon tablet and I love it. I love the navy back. The screen is good the battery life is great. I added a large memory SD card from Amazon (i do not store my apps on it as this would slow them down).The price was great - got it on Amazon Prime day for around £70. I'm not sure I'd be happy paying more than £120 for it - I think this model sells in shops for around £120-150 so Amazon is definitely the best place to buy it and they do periodic 'sales' or offers on the price so it's worth holding out for buying one on here if money is tight.The apps available are decent. First time I've used anything with android on it. I got rid of the silk browser though and downloaded Chrome - much faster. Apart from Prime Video and Shopping I archived the amazon apps and found alternatives. I don't use Alexa on it as I prefer not to have AI listening in. 24/7.Update Dec 2023.Still working great. I have YouTube, Now TV, Prime Video & Netflix on it. Great in the kitchen when cooking if i want to listen to something or at night listening to audio books, music or podcasts in bed.Screen rocks, its excellent and Ive had zero issues with it.Forgot to say it is totally Fruit computer compatible, no issues. I still struggle to find the extetnal controls because im so used to years of the button positions of the fruit phone and fruit pad! Still a happy bunny tho..

This is what a good tablet looks like

I bought the first generation iPad. Big, clumsy, slow, and pretty much a large phone without the phone functionality. I vowed never to waste 3-400 quid on something so instantly obsolete. Recently I found myself wishing for a tablet sized screen with a simple operating system, I don't need it to try and be my phone, I have £1000 phone that does ok thank you very much. I just want to watch TV on a bigger screen and a few bits and bobs. Enter the Fire HD. Price - check, size - check, functionality - check.I took the plunge taking advantage of the Black Friday discounts and was very happy with the result.Let's be honest it's just a big screen and some apps, but that's all I want. I don't need it to be my main technology link, the centre of my tech life, I just need a simple screen that I can watch TV on and do a few bits conveniently.The device is well made, looks good, has a great screen resolution, and you can if required tweak and fettle it to suit your needs which are probably different to mine. I can't fault it. So far nothing has produced a wry smile and a shrug ahh well moment, it does everything I need it to do, but it does it easily with no immersive research session on how to make it do the most simple thing.I don't need Alexa, switched off easily no complaint. I don't need children's apps, maps, home device control, word processing, etc. etc. I just need a simple screen and a few bits.So if you need a simple tablet to compliment the tech you already own with paying the best part of 4-500 quid because its loaded with stuff you will never use this is the tablet for you.I like the fact it's linked to my amazon account, I like the fact it doesn't try to bully me into buying services, it just waves them in front of me and respects my not interested response. I'm happy with that.The price is keen, the product is good, If you need a cheap, no make that good value tablet that has the level of sophistication that makes it easy to use and painless to maintain, this is your tablet right here.Very happy, highly recommended. Apple would do well to realise there is a market for a cheap screen with apps, we have already paid a lot for all the other stuff.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2024Style Name: Wi-FiSize Name: 64 GBColour Name: SilverVerified Purchase
I have been debating getting one for ages. The main things for me were price, portability, power, browsing and light office work. This is coming from someone who had a gaming pc but wanted to move to a hybrid and portable set up of a PS5 and tablet.I actually set it up using my iPhone as you can transfer apps and data. I made sure I didn’t transfer media to save space. So I was up and running in about 10 minutes.This iPad covers all my needs. Browsing is seamless, and with the added split screen function you can do useful things such as copy and pasting between apps and browsers, or just comparing. It’s nice to not have two monitors and be sat at a desk.For light office work it’s great. Excel nothing more than adding and light formula. With word easy editing, nothing fancy. It blitzes these tasks with ease.I went with the 64gb version as I have a Microsoft 365 family licence. I therefore back up all the photos and documents to OneDrive, so the 64gb is barely used. I also stream my music and have subscriptions to video services, so again I’d always get the base model and use 3rd party storage options to save cost on the actual model.The speakers are great so having it on while cooking or just lounging is really nice.Price, right now is fantastic £371.Accessories, I like typing on screen so all I bought was a cheap cover and tempered glass screen. This makes it very portable and versatile.If you’re looking for something to get you through general day to day, this is a great choice. If you design, draw, or do heavy editing look at the other options.All in all I love it, and when this can’t get the latest updates I’ll buy a new one, and trade this one in towards it.

My Teenage Sons Review of an Ipad.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2022Style Name: Wi-FiSize Name: 64 GBColour Name: YellowVerified Purchase
A pricy christmas gift for my 14 year old. He loves his tech - here is a review from his perspective.""Hello this is Safi typing on Google docs through my new iPad. The experience is not nice for me because of the width of the iPad. It is a bit too big for me. When I saw the size was 10.9 inches, I didn't  think it would hurt my hands using it, other than that this is a really great device.The speakers sound really great and really loud with plenty of bass, a lot louder than my old IPad Mini 2.This iPad is running IOS 16 which I have to say is very different but very nice once you get used to the Operating System. It's really lovely and feels advanced to use.One thing that I am disappointed in is battery life. On my old IPad I felt that battery life was longer. Okay I do now that Apple promised 10 hours of battery which is true but I will say for someone who just uses literally their iPad all day would like something with more battery life.By the way, just to mention I am writing this review on this device.The A14 processor here is very powerful. Everything I have tried hasn’t been enough to kill the chip meaning that nothing really crashes. Games like Asphalt 8 work really well here. One more great or not so good thing is the screen. The screen gets reasonably bright but for some reason is very reflective. Because of this it won’t be nice to use outdoors as your travel device, but for indoor use this is really functional.Okay time for the moment of truth- can this IPad replace your PC?I would say yes and no.If you are doing basic tasks like web browsing and document writing but if you are an editor or a creator of any kind you may want a PC with a physical keyboard. I mean that shouldn’t be the reason because you could always buy the Smart Keyboard Folio from Apple for £279.99.The main reason is just that on an iPad you don’t have access to some browser extensions and software like full photoshop and also just how yoUnuse the app on an IPad and PC.Would I recommend this IPad?Yes I would. If you are looking for a tablet that can do 90% of daily uses then I would but if you need access to lots of add on and accessory software then no or for video editing because it’s just sometimes nicer to use a PC. And for the price I would say this is totally worth it.This is 8 stars from me.Thanks for listening and watching and I will see you in the next one. Bye.""#Apple #TechReview #Ipad

Excellent piece of kit for GT7 PS5
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 July 2023Style Name: PlayStation | PCPattern Name: G29 | G920Verified Purchase
This is a great entry level type wheel and perfect for Gran turismo 7. It really takes it to another level, to the extent that you’ll never want to play with a standard controller again!You get strong force feedback, quality pedals and a premium feeling steering wheel. You don’t however get the gear stick included, but the wheel does have paddle shift as standard for gear changes.Compared to the previous generation Logitech wheel I once owned (driving force GT) it’s a definite upgrade, being quieter in operation and generally feeling better overall. My only minor criticism would be that the option button is a bit tricky to locate without looking at the wheel, whilst you’re playing and there is no horn button in the centre of the wheel. The supplied clamps are very good, but it can be tricky securing it adequately, if you don’t use the right piece of furniture, but definitely not the fault of the product. I use a small table, which is fine if you’re mindful of very aggressive movements. My friend has a bespoke stand and the same wheel, which is absolutely superb for securing the wheel and enhancing the experience, without worrying about the wheel coming loose.I have heard others complaining about the feel of the brake pedal. I find it to be fine myself. It is a little stiff, but it does seem to break in a little with use and become a bit softer. It felt a lot better secured in the stand my friend uses, but it’s perfectly fine to use without, resting on the floor/carpet (it has a carpet gripper on the pedal base).I’d highly recommend this wheel, for the price I think this wheel does it all and provides a realistic, fun driving experience.

G29 Sublime
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 May 2016Style Name: PlayStation | PCPattern Name: G29 | G920Verified Purchase
First of all, yes Logitech did the dirty claiming that PS4 compatibility relied on some mythical ‘chip’ that only the G29 had and their older wheels couldn’t provide. Project CARS debunked that by supporting many wheels that didn’t contain said ‘chip’. However, dodgy company ethics and lack of trust aside, this is a review of a product, not a company, so with that out of the way, here we go….Credentials - I’ve had an improbably high number of racing wheels over the years, from the brittle Madcatz wheels of the PSX era, a gameport connection Microsoft Sidewinder for GP Legends on the PC, a number of Logitech wheels, Xbox 360 efforts and most recently, a Fanatec GT3 RS with Clubsport V2 pedals. I love my racing games from arcade titles such as the (now) excellent Driveclub to the semi-sim Forza and Gran Turismo titles right through to the more simulator(y)  rFactor 2, Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally and Project CARS.Why did I buy a G29 - The Fanatec gear is a level up in terms of hardware technology without doubt. However, my GT3 RS wheel was, to be honest, a needy screaming child of a peripheral. During two years of ownership, I’ve had to fettle, replace, reset, clean and, most memorably, resolder microswitches. It was a nightmare of ownership. The pedals, while works of art, were occasionally troublesome also. Roll forward to the last few weeks, and a rigorous stage of Dirt Rally resulted in a loud crack of snapping plastic and a number of plastic fragments exiting the wheelbase. This coupled with the failure of a few more microswitches meant it was time to call it quits. The G29 came up at what I consider a decent price-point a few days later. That’s fate I guess.And so to the Logitech -  First impressions are unsurprisingly similar to my old G25 setup, albeit minus the H-shifter. The plastics are cheap and greasy looking, but robust. The buttons and contact points feel solid and likely to outlast me. The leather feels good and makes your hands smell a bit funny initially.There is no extraneous give or slack in anything. It looks a little more toy-like than other wheels, but the extravagant number of switches, rockers, dials and lights are worth the fussy looks - more on those next.The wheel - Buttons! Buttons everywhere!! But, while initially overwhelming, you soon find out how much flexibility they give you. The rotary dial is satisfying to click around and is superb for adjusting brake balances on the fly during a qualifier in Project CARS. On PC, it means you can map more controls than ever before to the wheel rather than having to flail at the keyboard during a crucial moment. PS4 compatibility is superb (let’s be honest, it blinking well ought to be), giving you the full compliment of buttons to navigate the PS dashboard.The only missing features compared to the Dual Shock controllers are the touch-pad, the speaker and the headphone jack (a shame). Otherwise, you can leave your gamepads in their charging dock and happily use the wheel.The change lights are a nice touch, although if you have a more upright seating arrangement as I do, it tends to be out of your eye-line. A more laid back setup, such as a Playseat would make them a valuable asset however.The feedback from the wheel is pretty good. Coming from a belt-driven Fanatec wheel, it initially felt a little granular - hardly surprising as it uses a gear-drive. But that has proven to not be a total step back. The wheel itself feels a lot more precise  than the Fanatec. There’s no slack in the turn at all and road-positioning is a totally new level. Lap times did tumble after a very short learning curve, mostly due to the sheer consistency of the wheel movement. The Fanatec, despite a better resolution, optical sensor and a more powerful motor always seemed to be a step behind - wandery and more aloof. The G29 has turned spiky handling games into smooth joyous experiences.The Pedals - Ok, they’re not going to better a set of £250 Clubsport V2’s, but consider that they come bundled with a wheel for a lot less than £200 and they are not too shabby. The only difference to the ones on the G25 is the brake pedal which now has some resistance. This saves having to modify it like previous Logitech pedals (memories of finding the right springiness of squash ball spring to mind). It’s a cheap update, but it works very well. While only low resolution, all pedals feels responsive and easily modulated. One other advantage is that you won’t have to clean the sensors every couple of minutes (cough Clubsports….)Compatibility - As mentioned, the G29 works with the PS4 superbly and I really mean that. Not having to power on a gamepad to be able to switch the console off or access the dashboard is fantastic. In terms of games, Project CARS was made to work with the wheel and it shows, with the default control scheme being spot on. Driveclub is also well setup for painless ease of use. Moving across to the PC and most modern racers support the wheel out-of-the-box after installing the Logitech driver software. All positive.Conclusion - Ignore the money-grabbing Lgotech ethics and what you have is a superb but undeniably old-school wheel. That’s not a bad thing as judging by the old Drive Force wheel I have in the loft, it’s likely to be with cockroaches and Nissan Micra’s in being capable of surviving a nuclear apocalypse.Coming from the Fanatec fold, I’ll take that as a worthy upgrade.

Loads of fun
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2022Style Name: PlayStation | PCPattern Name: G29 | G920Verified Purchase
I have bought it for my son, but I enjoy using it as well. We are mostly playing Gran Turismo 7 and it gives loads of fun to use it compering to a pad. You need to get used to using it, it is not that easy at the beginning and it may be discouraging. But once you learn how to use it, it is amazing.I love the size of the wheel, and the leather cover. The build quality and the feeling is very good. I have compered it in the shop to the cheaper model of Thrustmaster T80 and it felt more like a toy for younger children compering to this one. It is nice that it has the functionality of the pad so can go through game menu using the wheel.Using it on the couch is not the most comfortable. I have found the pedals nice to use, but when playing for longer time the angle is not perfect for me and causes some discomfort. It feels much more comfortable to use with pc, connecting the wheel to the desk and using gaming chair.I would say for casual gaming it is a great choice, gives fun, feels pro, quality is good, and it is compatible with many games (e.g. Need for Speed). It is nice that it works with PS5 and PC but huge minus for Logitech for not making one version that would support xbox as well (you need g920 version if you want to play on xbox, but then it does not support PS).

I recently purchased the Sage Barista Express Coffee Machine, and it has completely transformed my morning routine into a delightful experience. The machine's sleek design not only adds a touch of elegance to my kitchen but also speaks of its high quality.Firstly, the ease of use is remarkable. With its intuitive controls, I was able to make my first espresso within minutes of unboxing. The machine heats up incredibly fast, ensuring I don't have to wait long for my morning coffee fix.The quality of espresso this machine produces is where it truly shines. The flavor is rich and robust, with a perfect crema that you'd expect from a high-end cafe. The built-in grinder is a game-changer – it grinds the beans just before brewing, which makes a significant difference in the freshness and taste of the coffee.Moreover, the milk frothing wand is fantastic. It creates silky smooth milk for cappuccinos and lattes that are simply a delight. The temperature control is precise, ensuring the milk is always at the perfect temperature.Cleaning the Sage Barista Express is surprisingly easy. The removable water tank and drip tray make the maintenance a breeze. I appreciate how the machine comes with all the necessary tools for cleaning and maintenance.Lastly, the customer service from Sage is commendable.

 If you want to experience the awakening smell of freshly ground beans and amazing coffee at home, this is one of the greatest options at this price point. I’ve owned quite a few espresso machines in my life, this is the more expansive I even had but it gives by far the best results. The difference in quality and taste is huge.Some advice: what the machine requires is some patience at the beginning or when you get a new coffee blend. You will need to adjust a bit the grind level, the amount of coffee, tamping and the time it needs for extraction. It might take a couple of not so good shots until you dial it in, but once you do you are good to go.I’ve been using it for 6 months now, and I have settled in a coffee blend I like, so I don’t need to dial the settings very often. The pro-tip here, is to get freshly roasted coffee (about a month, month and half should be fine). I also tried generic coffee beans from known brands, the ones without roasting date, but the results are not as good.When using the machine, the analog pressure gauge (I love this, feels so professional) gives you a good overview, so you can see and adjust for the next shot:Low pressure and coffee running too fast? Maybe dial the grind level to be more refined, or add a bit coffee if the portafilter can take it.Too much pressure and very slow extraction? Move the grind level dial to be more coarse.Once you play around a bit, you will be able to see what the espresso needs and you will adjust. There are many helpful online tutorials if you want to dive into the whole process, but in general one should be ok with minor adjustments and able to enjoy tasty, velvety coffee – given you use good quality coffee.If you don’t want to buy freshly roasted coffee, you can use the dualwall filters provided in the machine; they allow for some extra pressure control of the extracted coffee, but in my opinion, if you buy this machine, you probably want good espresso, so buy the good coffee as well :)In general the machine is very easy to clean, I pop the tray in the washing machine every now and then and has been looking like new, even though I’m working from home and I’ve been using it quite a few times per day.The provided milk jug, with temperature indicator is great for great cappuccino / latte foam.Overall, this has been an amazing purchase, if you enjoy a good coffee and you are willing to learn how to extract it, this machine will not let you down.

A massive upgrade on my previous machine
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 May 2023Colour Name: Brushed Stainless SteelStyle Name: Manual TampingPattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I had a couple of DeLonghi Dedica machines before this, both of which just about made it past the warranty expiry before giving up the ghost. Not great when you consider that, whilst  I use it daily, I'm the only person in the house that drinks coffee.I decided when the second one failed that I would go big(ger) rather than go home, and decided to go for the Sage Barista Express. It was a great choice.Firstly, the grind size settings should satisfy any taste - a very small amount of experimentation got me to just the right size grind. The auto-grind feature is very handy, and allows you to get anything else ready whilst it does its thing - I'm a latte kind of guy, so I have enough time to sort the milk out. A few people have reported that it can end up with coffee going everywhere - I can only assume that they are grinding far too much and it is spilling out of the sides (yet another thing that is adjustable). If you want more, you can always tamp it down and top it up manually, which takes about five seconds, so no hardship at all. The tamper is held in place magnetically - another nice touch.You can also adjust the amount of espresso that the machine makes, which is handy. You basically press a button to put it in program mode, set the machine away, and press another button when your espresso glass is full - it's very, very easy to set up.The water tank has a built in filter - a nice touch, though I live in a very soft water area, so not really necessary for me.The built in thermometer on the milk jug is a nice touch (and it survives the dishwasher, though I wouldn't recommend that)! I thought the jug looked a bit small, but I use a Starbucks Grande mug for my latte, and there is plenty of room for enough milk to fill that. Unless you go for vente all the time, you'll probably have no issues.The bean holder takes enough beans for around ten double espressos or so - you can also use pre-ground coffee, and the machine comes with various attachments depending on single / double / fresh or pre-ground tastes. It's also really easy to clean - the machine mostly looks after itself and vents after every drink, so you just need to empty the drip tray every few days (it tells you when it needs attention).This is a great machine. I wish I bought one four and a half years ago before I wasted my money on the others. The coffee tastes better (I didn't believe it would make any difference to the taste, but somehow it does - I think it is the fact that it goes through a pre-extraction cycle on a lower pressure before going full whack - and yes, you can even see how much pressure is being applied, so you can increase / decrease the coffee ground level accordingly), and it looks great on the side.

Due to the fear of having my phone snatched from my hand whilst using it to contact my partner whilst I am out walking my dog I thought of getting a pair of these (much cheaper than replacing my phone if snatched). Well, all I can say is, I made the perfect choice, the reception is brilliant, great range, checked it at approximately 2 miles and no interference at all. Very light with easy to use clip-on to a belt or coat. As a woman I feel so much more confident having the knowledge of one click of a button I am in touch with my boyfriend or whoever is on the other end. Be great to use around boot sales and markets if we split up. I have been telling all my friends about my great buy. Thank you.

Simple and effective
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 July 2013Verified Purchase
My 3 year old daughter was going through a phase in which she would wake up in the middle of the night and go to our bedroom. I remembered seeing this item on amazon, so I ordered it to see if it would do mommy and daddy a big favour.When it arrived, she loved it, specially the sun and the star images. The story book included is algo a good idea to show them the purpose of the clock, and the demo mode is also very useful to show how the little stars disappear as the night passes by.Now, when it's time to go to bed, she has the ritual of saying good-bye to the sun and push the button so the star watches her over the night. And we don't have visits in the middle of the night anymore, but sometimes she enters in our room earlier in the morning than was supposed to. She says to me that the sun has appeared, but that's because she has pushed the button to make it appear. It's my fault, I'm always forgetting to lock the clock when she's asleep :)Also it is possible to program two different wake up hours, so I use one for the weekend and the other for workdays, very useful indeed. It also  has an alarm clock, I tried it once but wasn't enough loud to make her wake up. :)The only thing that I don't like it so much it's its brightness. Although it's possible to adjust between 10 different levels, I think the lowest one it's still a bit brighter than I would like. It makes a good night light, but I have to turn the clock away from bed, because the blue light might awake her during the lighter phases of sleep.Overall I recommend it to parents who need to teach their children to stay in bed during the night, and also it makes a very nice night light.Pros:- Very easy to handle, even for children- Possible to program two different wake up hours- Demo mode makes it easier to explain to kids- Book with children's story to teach how the clock can help themCons:- Lowest level of brightness isn't dim enough- Alarm clock could have other beeps and the possibility to change volume

Our Best Amazon Purchase
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 December 2011Verified Purchase
We have bought alot of products from Amazon for our baby. But I have to say that this is the without a doubt, our best purchase. BUT, we bought it a bit too early, when he was only two years old which was before our baby knew his colors. At first, he simply did not get the idea that he had to wait for the yellow sun, because he did not now what yellow was. He was frustrated, we were frustrated and we put the clock away. A few months later, when he learned his colors, we tried the clock again. This time it was a BIG success. Every night, he would say bye bye to the Sun. He loved to see the star come out. Then every morning, he yells ""YELLOW SUN!"" and we rush to him. That is our deal. He waits patiently for the yellow sun. When he yells ""YELLOW SUN"" we rush to him with lots of hugs and kisses. It really works. Sometimes we hear him moving around. We know he is awake and waiting for the sun. And then he calls us. We love hearing him in the morning. It sounds something like ""Wewow Shun"" and we always are there in seconds. What a fun idea. We love it. He loves it. And everyone sleeps better.I have read some of the negative reviews, with people commenting that the light is bright (It is not too bright for us. But we have always used a night light so we can go in and look at him from time to time. The light from the clock does not make the room brighter than the night light alone), it is difficult to set up (it was a bit challenging to get used to at first, like many digital clocks today. But when you do it every night, you get used to it). That it is not baby friendly and your baby will keep resetting the time (that depends on your baby. We asked our guy not to play with it. He doesn't play with it so it is not a problem. If your kid is likely to play with it, you have to put it up out of their reach where they can still see it. Problem solved). That your baby will come in and tell you the status of the clock (our guy still sleeps in a baby cot)Frankly, this is a very well made clock. You can set it to two times, for example if you wake up early during the week and wake up late during the weekend. Or one time for the nap and one time for the morning. The animation is fun and idea is very baby friendly. If it does not work for you it is probably not the clock. It may just be that, like with us, your kid is not ready for it. If your baby does not know his colors or your baby can not be taught easily, then this may not be the right product for you. But if your kid knows the difference between yellow and blue and if you can teach your kid, and if you play the game that when they call ""Yellow Sun"", that you promptly arrive and give them lots of kisses and hugs, you will love this product. AND you will get more sleep too.

Great product, it works, simple clean design, useful features.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 September 2011Verified Purchase
First, like all things in life, it won't work for EVERY child - why expect it to?  But it does have an enormous success rate, so I feel bad for the parents where it doesn't.My daughter has just turned 2 and was starting to wake up earlier and earlier.  I bought the clock, set it for 6:10 wake-up and told her wait for the sun ... and she did!  After a few days I upped it to 6:15 and now we're on 6:20.  In the 6 days we've had it, only one failure with daughter waking up earlier.The important points:3 buttons control everything - an up, down and a selct. It's easy to operate.You have the option to set 2 different wake up times - one for morning and one for an afternoon nap.There is no 'go to sleep' time.  When the child is ready for bed you initiate the sleep mode manually and the sun winks, the yellow backlight fades and is replaced by the star with the blue backlight. (The reverse happens automatically at your pre-set wake-up time)There is also an alarm option but I havent used this.Now this one is REALLY IMPORTANT. I didn't want my daughter getting reliant on a blue light all night, but you can adjust the blue glow brightness (about 10 different levels) or have it turn off altogether!!! Perfect. I have it turn off completely, so when she is about to go to bed she sees the sun turn into a blue star and after a few seconds it goes to a dark background.  The next light she sees is the yellow sun in the morning.  Note - you cannot adjust the sun brightness but there's no point in that.It's nice to know that someone has thought carefully about what's useful (and what isn't).During the day I just wanted a standard clock in her room - well guess what, you can have this.  After a while (about half an hour but haven't counted) the sun switches to a digital time display on a dark background.Have already recommended this to friends.  Good luck!

So let me start by saying this isn’t necessarily going to replace brushing their teeth, especially if you have historic build-up like we had, but if you look at the picture included and imagine that the gums were bright red and the plague dark brown underneath, then this stuff definitely helps! I now have one of those finger tooth brushes and will endeavour to be more diligent at brushing to break down the heavy deposits.

            So let me start by saying this isn’t necessarily going to replace brushing their teeth, especially if you have historic build-up like we had, but if you look at the picture included and imagine that the gums were bright red and the plague dark brown underneath, then this stuff definitely helps! I now have one of those finger tooth brushes and will endeavour to be more diligent at brushing to break down the heavy deposits.

I originally ordered this for my 2 cats as their teeth were showing signs of tartar and staining ( also bad breath ) and I didn't want a massive vet bill for cleaning them. The cats are 10 and 11 so I was sceptical it would make much difference. ......How wrong I was.....this powder is great.......so good I now give it to my 2 years old dog to prevent tartar. The cats teeth and breath  have drastically improved and everyone comments on how white my dogs teeth are. Would definitely recommend

ProDen Plaque Off Powder
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 August 2016Size Name: 60 g (Pack of 1)Style Name: SingleVerified Purchase
They say:‘ProDen Plaque Off is an easy way to help care for your pet’s teeth, and when used regularly it can help to control tartar and bad breath. PlaqueOff does not have to be applied directly on the teeth, but rather comes in a powder form that is sprinkled on your pet's food. When the ingredients are absorbed into the blood via the digestion and enters the saliva, they prevent plaque by affecting the ability of plaque to 'stick' to surfaces in the mouth. Existing tartar also then becomes porous, and loosens by itself or can be easily removed by brushing or cleaning. It is made from seaweed, which has been found to have special beneficial effects for oral care, and contains 12 vitamins, 13 minerals & trace elements and is rich in natural iodine. It is free from artificial colours, preservatives, gluten and sugar.’Verdict:I initially purchased a smaller tub of PlaqueOff to test, unsure if my dog would accept it and if it did indeed work, as it is pricey.My dog is a 5, nearing 6, Pug/Jack Russell cross. I have had lots of issues with tartar control and I was desperate to find something that could boost the benefits of brushing his teeth, something he is not fond of. I was tempted to resort to dental cleaning at the vets but was very hesitant to put him through the procedure until I had exhausted all other options as he does have epilepsy and has had bad reactions during surgery in the past.The granules have been added to his dry food every day for almost a year. He is a very fussy eater and so I am always weary about adding supplements as in the past he has subsequently refused food even after stopping their use! With this, there was absolutely no hesitation and this has been sustained. The powder does have a very powerful seaweed smell when opening the tub, but this is obviously negligible even to his super-sensitive nose once sprinkled over his food. There is a small measuring spoon provided within the tub, so making sure the correct dosage is added is easy.There has been some negativity aimed at this product, but I believe this is largely through some owners believing this is a quick fix item to what is serious tartar build-up. It isn’t. Providing it is used as part of a complete oral healthcare routine, the product will boost results seen from these measures alone. This includes daily brushing and the provision of chews and toys that promote good dental care. The powers of PlaqueOff can only be seen if the dog is given items to actively scrub the plaque and tartar from their teeth as PlaqueOff loosens it!Alongside this, I use Logic Oral Hygiene Gel, another lifesaver which he loves the taste of, which can be used through the dog simply licking the product, though brushing does enhance results. For brushing, I use a Lintbells Microfibre Tooth Cleaner, which work better than a toothbrush. He also has a daily DentaStix and has plenty of chew toys and dental toys which promote gum health and help prevent tartar build up.Though this item is costly, it does not measure up to the debt racked up by veterinarian bills for dental cleaning! Now that I have observed good results and know he is tolerating it, I have bought a larger tub which brings the overall cost down. These tubs go a long, long way, so in the long run, the product has been very helpful and I would recommend it highly.Positive:- It works!!- Palatable- Simple to use- Large tubs reduce long term costsNegative:- Is quite costly- No noticeable reduction in bad breath

Today is the 9/02 and we only started using this for our elderly greyhound 4/02 and the difference is unreal, his canines were covered it grey plaque from bottom almost to tip and i swear almost 80% of the plaque has already disappeared and the white in his teeth are alot whiter. I was mentally preparing myself to take him for a dental clean all though reluctant due to his age and risks with anethesia but i honestly dont think he will need to now. No matter how bad your dogs teeth are covered with plaque please try this before doing anything else as it does actually work. It is pricey but worth its weight in gold for how well and quick it works!!

Actually removes tartar
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2024Size Name: 60 g (Pack of 1)Style Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I read on one of the reviews use for 3 weeks then use a tooth scraper gently and it will soften the tartar build up and it actually did. I have a pug which anyone with this type of dog is aware it’s hard to get their teeth with a toothbrush due to shape and also they absolutely hate it or mine does. Well he had a build up of harden tartar which I wanted to be removed by the vet who advised it would be 600 for scale and polish… tried this first and all of it has come off completely and I use the scraper only slightly and gently on his teeth and is now back to normal. Honestly try this for 3 weeks first to soften it before being charged lots for a teeth clean at the vet’s. Can’t actually believe it worked 😊👍

Brilliant Buy
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 July 2013Verified Purchase
I bought the Rainforest Jumperoo as soon as my son could confidently hold his head up on his own and it's worth every penny! The second I put him in it his face lit up and he started bouncing, he was also captivated by the front console with the lights and sounds.I think this product has been really well thought out and is bursting with features to give you value for money and your child hours of fun.The central seat swivels 360 degrees and there is entertainment around the whole thing. The front central console (the bit that needs 3 AA batteries that aren't included) lights up and plays music and animal sounds when your child bounces, it also has animal figures for your child to grab and manipulate.There's also a spinning lizard, a spinning sun, a spinning colour wheel, a butterfly on a bendy stick and a little peek a boo tiger that pops up when your child pushes a button so it has ALOT going on and actually becomes more interactive as your child gets older.My six month old nephew has a Jumperoo and is only just starting to notice some of the toys on it. It's like discovering a new toy for him and he's newly captivated every time he's put in it.The base is sturdy with 3 well made 'bungees' which are coiled springs attached to nylon strapping. There a three length settings so as your child grows you can make the seat higher, meaning they are still kept on tip toes for optimum bouncing!All in all this product is well made, worth the money and hours of fun for your little one.I would say that the only down side is that its a large bit of kit and is not made for small rooms - it needs a decent amount of space to stand and whilst you can take it apart, it doesn't fold down or anything, once it's up it's up.

An absolute must!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 February 2012Verified Purchase
I got this Jumperoo when my son was about 3 months old. I know he was young but he felt ready for it, being quite good at holding his head up from early on, as well as pushing and holding on his legs (his kicks at the end of my pregnancy literally took my breath away). He had so much gas and reflux that I'd spend all day holding him up and burping him. After 3 months of this, I was EXHAUSTED and really needed something that wouldn't involve him lying down or being seated (bumbo type) as both these positions would either make him cry or vomit. I did extensive research, read about the Jumperoo (only ever good things) and some friends mentioned how happy they were with theirs. I thought I'd give it a try and hoped for the best. Well..... if you must buy one piece of kit, make it this one! It is truly worth every single penny and more.At first, he was a bit dubious and scared of the flying parrot and frog, but I put that on the fact that he was so young. Soon enough though, he got to loving being in there and once he found out how the jumping worked, OMG.... hours of entertainment! I'd be able to leave him in there while doing a bit of cleaning, cooking, etc. When he was bored of it, it usually meant that it was time for a nap. The jumping and activity would sort of wear him out and he'd sleep so well after a Jumperoo session. As we're always out of batteries, I never got round to putting the sounds and lights on but he had so much fun anyway without them that I didn't bother. He's now nearly 8 months old and I just recently put the batteries in - he prefers it without. Now he crawls and has started standing and cruising around the  living room (maybe thanks to all that jumping?), he doesn't enjoy being in the Jumperoo so much. But he's still in there a little everyday, mainly first thing in the morning after he's had breakfast and so I can have a quick shower. At least I know he's safe in there as otherwise, I can't take my eyes off him for more than a second.All in all, I would definitely recommend this Jumperoo to anyone especially those with super active babies or those like us, with gassy/refluxy little ones. Again, worth the cost and the (large) size of it in your living room!

Frustrating fun!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 February 2024Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase
Like many Mario and/or platform games this is fun but can get very frustrating! You will die/fail a ton of times - don't expect anything else. Even people who lie on the internet that they're the world's best gamer will die a lot in this game.It is a vibrant and colourful sidescrolling platformer as you would come to expect from the Mario franchise. As much as it is kid-friendly in spirit I'm an adult and I find it quite difficult so I'm not sure how kids could handle playing it, although I'm something of a completionist so perhaps kids would be happier to run through the levels without collecting everything than I am.I do like it but it gets frustrating at times, but hey maybe it's just me getting old!

So useful
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 July 2023Style Name: Without Kindle UnlimitedSize Name: 64 GBOffer Type: Premium PenVerified Purchase
Although I’m averse to smoothing the path of Bezos I have to admit that this invention is my best purchase for a long time, and slightly addictive.As a writer I use a lot of reference texts, and find the Scribe great to organise them: Kindle books and pdfs can be grouped in Collections. Older books (e.g. Victorian era and early 1900s) can be uploaded as pdf e.g. from the Internet Archive. The ability to write notes on the source text - these help me to retrieve the relevant page quickly -  is so useful.I find the Notebooks excellent for capturing ideas and journalling. I once had a fancy leather-bound notebook but was too shy to write on the beautiful paper. Now I happily create and delete all sorts of notes. The Scribe can convert a handwritten note fairly accurately to text and email it to me. I then copy and paste the text into my draft, tidy it up, and it’s good to go.I haven’t used handwriting on a tablet recently, so I can’t compare the Scribe with competitors, but I enjoy its handwriting experience - smooth and easy. I’ve adjusted the pen thickness to simulate a rollerball. There is a useful set of notebook templates - I have made myself a diary - and notebooks can be organised into folders and subfolders.For me, the screen is the perfect size; with easily adjustable lighting it’s ideal for bedtime reading. Battery life seems excellent and it recharges quickly from any USB-C cable.There are a few drawbacks:Books published prior to the development of Kindle and still within copyright may be unobtainable for the Scribe. So if working with sources from, say, the 1970s to early 1990s this device would not work for me.I find the Scribe struggles to display some large pdfs. The limit for ‘Send to Kindle’ is 200MB, but 10MB - 20 MB seems to be the limit for viewing at a reasonable speed. I find that for big pdfs an iPhone or iPad is a more agile viewer. Books on the Internet Archive that were digitised by Google are usually below 10MB and display well; if a B+W version of the pdf is there, that’s the one to choose.There seems no way to create subfolders in the Collections, which might be a simple and useful upgrade in the future.The Shopping Trolley icon enables me to instantly buy books in the Kindle Store - this could be a good or a bad thing!Reviewers have complained that the button on the Premium pen is badly sited so that it switches accidentally between modes like ‘Pen’ and ‘Highlighter’ when writing. I set the alternative mode to ‘Pen’ so that it doesn’t matter if it switches.Folders of Notebooks don’t seem linkable to Collections.The diary template doesn’t include a calendar - diary templates with calendars can be bought from third parties but are expensive. I’ve created the equivalent of a paper desk diary by using the day-per-page template, writing in the dates by hand, creating a separate notebook for each month, and saving them in a folder named ‘Diary’.The magnet that holds the pen to side of the Scribe keeps them together on my desk but is ineffective in my bag. I’ve ordered a 3rd party case that holds the pen in a small tray. I thought the official case was too expensive. The device is slim but dense so that when reading in bed its weight is noticeable. I prop it up on a pillow.The bottom line:I love it - if I were one of those publishing assistants who had to evaluate masses of manuscript submissions all the time, this is the device I would use.

This Is definitely a Keeper... 7 months later I have no intention of changing my mind. I love It!!!!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 December 2022Style Name: Without Kindle UnlimitedSize Name: 64 GBOffer Type: Premium PenVerified Purchase
I've had the Kindle scribe for seven months now (Since it's first launched) I thought it would be good idea to let potential buyers, who are considering which e-tablet to get to know what's been going on.  since my Dec 22 update, a lot has changed, and all for the better.  Every one of my wishes that I thought might have improved the Kindle Scribe, has been met with its three updates, plus much much more! It's almost on par with the remarkable, only the remarkable can't increase its lagging 226 ppi or a backlight.  Amazon has promised to continue regular updates, so to me it's quite clear there may be additional updates, like possibly rotating objects with the lasso and or the addition of shapes. we definitely have 3.5 more years of potential updates, that I'm confident that Amazon will deliver. I use my scribe every day without fail, wether its just to jot down reminders, drawing or brainstorming ideas that my old brain might forget.  All I have to do to start reading or writing, is the open the cover, just like opening a book!Because it's only asleep, it takes about a second to wake up and be ready for whatever you want to read, write or draw . I know it's never going to let me down for insufficient power, due to its amazing battery, that lasts for weeks.  I love this thing and its with me day or night. After seven months, it really is still my favourite gadget and I'm unashamed of being a geek.  For potential buyers, I can only say, what are you waiting for? buy it before the price goes up.Dec 22 UpdateFor about a year now I've been longing for a product like this, since my brother introduced me to his Remarkable 2. Although he kept on telling me it might be better to buy an iPad because it can do a lot more.  It did not put me off, because I wanted a product, that I could write on, that didn't feel like writing on glass like my tablet/laptop does. If like me, you want a product that's distraction free, without all the gimmicks, you should consider the Kindle scribe. The Photos and videos do not give the Scribe any justice, it's elegant and stylish.  Its got quality written over it when you touch and hold it.  I have an old kindle voyage, but because its a bit slow and clunky, I really stopped using it.  But the Scribe has re-energised my reading again, and most of all no more yellow post it notes everywhere!!Honestly the writing is incredible; it looks, feels and sounds like writing on paper, only that you have an endless supply of it. (you can't get any greener than that) and no mess.I always screw up my messages in Christmas and birthday cards, but now I just write on the scribe  first, then copy what i've written.  Sure it can do with more features, like  different pressure and shading on the pencil, because I like to doodle when I'm on the phone sometimes, and shading will be useful for drawing.  But don't let that put you off, because that can be easily remedied with firmware upgrade. My brother told me his remarkable needed a few upgrades too, however its not 300ppi or doesn't have any backlight, something a firmware update cannot fix.  I went for the 64GB version because I have hundreds of large PDF files on my Nas drive, however it only took up 9GB! amazing! So I'd recommend the 32GB version because of he Pen, but trust me 16Gb is more than enough for most people unless you use Audible books.If you are looking for something like an iPad, I'm afraid this isn't. Its not meant to be! But if like me you wanted something that's not wasting paper like a real paperless office, with the ability to read thousand of books of different formats  (which the remarkable can't do, but it can read Epubs), with the most LEDs and best PPI e Ink tablet, then look no further than the distraction free Kindle Scribe.  It can be used day and night, without an exterrnal light, and with  warm variable lighting to protect your eyes. It's now my favourite gadget lol.

Fantastic Phone... seriously.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 September 2017Verified Purchase
It goes without saying that the gap between phones is getting smaller and smaller. Years ago, phones would either dominate the market, or just simply be forever in the ""cheap and acceptable"" area for performance and quality etc.I used to work for Vodafone, so got a lot of experience working with mobile phones and I have to be honest, I used to absolutely hate Samsung phones. However, that has all changed. This genuinely has completely changed my perspective on their handsets and I am sincerely impressed with what I have purchased. I have had several phones, including Sony Xperia z2, Xperia z5, Huawei p9, OnePlus 3T and recently I had a OnePlus 5 which I returned as faulty and instead for this Samsung S8. Allow me to break it down below into a few areas to give you a little insight with it.Speed and performance:I have to be honest, the performance on this handset is flawless. It is super quick, responsive and hasn't yet lagged at all or dipped in performance in the slightest. I can open the camera quickly (something that other phones struggle with if you're coming from an app), can take a photo and then go back to the app that I was in without any issues at all. Easily on par with the OnePlus handsets if I am honest.Battery:This is my only negative. I have the s8 meaning I have the 3000mah battery within the handset. I am pretty heavy on my phone, and forever checking emails and texting my girlfriend (gotta make her feel loved like haha) so always using it. After starting work at around 9am and finishing at 5, I am usually down to around 20% if I am in Quad HD Mode. I can put the resolution down to 1080p and will then with the same usage, be down to around 38% roughly on average, so it does make a difference. I don't find that things such as the camera have such a hard effect on the battery, unless you're filming in 4k, then you start to notice a metaphorical leak so to speak.Screen:My goodness... this is my favourite part. I always thought this bezeless, or at least small bezel thing was a bit of a gimmick, but oh no. I could never go back to a phone that doesn't have this kind of display ever again. This handset, is smaller than other smart phones, but has a bigger screen. Weird, huh? Well, because the screen practically covers the entire phone size, you get a beautiful view and great clarity that is simply gorgeous. I mentioned previously about Quad HD, which in my opinion is of equal sharpness to retina if I am honest. It does dip into the battery life, though, and to be honest, for normal viewing angles you will find 1080p perfect. 2k would be good for the VR experience. Honestly though, the screen is beautiful, I am being very serious when I say that this is the most beautiful screen I have seen on a phone before, and it has completely changed my opinion on how phones should be designed from now on.Camera:The camera is good. It offers good colour reproduction and produces sharp images. I am led to believe they have used the Samsung s7 camera in this. It has OIS, which is nice and definitely makes a difference. I find the video modes are good, and there are modes such as Pro Modes meaning you can take control of various controls on your camera. It's a shame that there isn't a dual camera setup, considering that a lot of phones are going that way, but let's be honest, if you're truly wanting to get into photography, then you're going to get yourself a DSLR. This phones camera performs excellently taking nice images and will suit the needs of the majority if not all of the people that use it. Video low light performance is a little bit average, but in well lit environments the colours are beautiful and are exceptionally well complemented by the gorgeous display.Bixby:Have to be honest, I don't like Bixby. Samsung have incorporated a physical button on the left hand side of the phone. I downloaded an app and disabled bixby in the system, so I don't have to content with that anymore. I would appreciate an update from Samsung allowing users to modify the rooting of that button, to complement their own wishes such as Google Now, or flashlight etc. Google Assistant is moving far faster, evolving in a much more advanced method, and works flawlessly 99% of the time. I had to repeat 3 times to Bixby to get the weather in Birmingham in the UK. Despite constantly saying ""What's the weather like in Birmingham, UK?"" it still kept referring to the sunny weather in Birmingham, Alabama... not the much wetter, much greyer weather here in the West Midlands.Overall:Look, this handset in my opinion is fantastic. Like I said, I used to hate Samsung and found their handsets overpriced and underspec. But I genuinely think this is a change. You can get a great deal and pay under the RRP if you look around well enough. The time researching for a better price is definitely worth it. The handset offers a beautiful, and I really do mean a beautiful design and great performance meeting many criterias and expectations. I love this phone. Honestly. I am usually so critical of phones and find it hard to settle with one, but so far, this handset is proving to be the best phone I have ever purchased. I would definitely recommend.One final note, the s8+? Yes, it has a bigger battery... but if you have an average sized hand (male), stick with the regular s8. Ladies, if you've got smaller hands, definitely stay with the S8... I am a man and use the normal one, because the plus size would require some serious hand gymnastics to reach the back button top left.If you found this useful, give me a helpful vote if you don't mind! Then I know that I have helped someone somewhere in the Amazon world.Take care

The best glass 'phone I've ever used
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 August 2019Verified Purchase
Good points:- Properly waterproof (until the screen cracks)- Virtual reality (if you buy the Gear, which is, err, cheap compared to the 'phone).  Not quite the stuff of sci-fi, but un-tethered and bloomin' good for a 'phone.  Also probably the only real use for the highest screen resolution. I can get about 3 hours' VR out of a charge.- Android- Some nice extras (fast processor, really nice screen, heart monitor, and the location uses at least 4 different satellite systems)- Screen still works when cracked, including touch.- Induction charging- Most spares are cheap and easy to get hold of, and there are plenty of Youtube demos showing how to replace them.Bad points, in order:- Curved screen. The most fragile part of the device sticks out beyond the rest, what could possibly go wrong?- Curved screen. Worth mentioning twice because it makes it hard to hold the device without touching the screen.  Also significantly increases the cost of rigid screen protectors.- Expensive screen.  Becomes a problem when it breaks.- Battery is on the small side for such a power-hungry device.  Awkward to replace, too.- Samsung requires access to location information whenever location is turned on.  It's in the terms and conditions, but they don't specify who they plan to tell when you go on holiday.- Mine refused to update for over a year (took a while to notice and a while to fix)- BixbyAll in, this is a really good portable computer, and a pretty good 'phone.  If you plan to carry it around then you will need a good case for it, but there are some good ones on the market now.  Probably not ideal for builders or wrestlers.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 June 2017Verified Purchase
I like it. It's slightly less wide than my last phone - iPhone 6s plus, but much better. I missed androids ergonomic thoughtfulness in how easy they make life. A phone ringer that actually rings this time is a bonus, but also the intuitive auto fill, rather than a battle with the iPhone to get it to recall that sentence I write thirty times a day. Not many good ring tones and harder to import the song you want to use. I think they want you to buy theirs.I don't love the position of the finger print touch button on this one,  at the back, which I think is proving less reliable or accessible, or the shiny case, which I have covered as it gathers prints and looks grubby.Most of the set up of apps and banking etc was easy. The password and contact lists had to be done by hand, despite numerous transfer attempts -arduous and took hours.Too much Samsung app push at the start and still can't get Nanny cam or cctv apps up and running - had to pay someone to help. That said I like it. What do I like? - the day to day running has more options and goes a little smoother - it's like it's on my side, not against me.The battery life is worse than the iPhone, but the fast charger is great. This was extra by the way, as was the long lead and case plus screen protector.The graphics seem brighter and the camera is very clear though. The speed of things is also superior. It's much lighter and easier to handle than my last phone. Feather compared to brick in feel.Pricey as it is just a phone, but better to have one that won't become obsolete in the next ten minutes.Update: I've managed to import some good ringtones now via hedge and the finger print touch position is growing on me.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2024Colour Name: BlueSize Name: HandyVerified Purchase
Bostik Blu Tack – a product so ubiquitous, yet so underrated. This unassuming little lump of blue putty has been a constant companion in homes, offices, and classrooms for generations. As someone who has relied on its versatility time and time again, I can confidently say that Blu Tack is an absolute must-have. 🙌Let's start with the obvious: its reusability. No more wasting rolls of tape or boxes of thumbtacks – Blu Tack can be molded, repositioned, and reused countless times without losing its adhesive properties. It's a small but significant step towards reducing waste and embracing sustainability. 🌱But the real magic of Blu Tack lies in its myriad of uses. From hanging posters and party decorations to fixing wobbly tables and holding cables in place, this multipurpose adhesive tackles it all with ease. Heck, it even doubles as a cleaning tool for removing pesky lint and dirt from keyboards and clothing! 🧽What truly sets Blu Tack apart, however, is its safety and user-friendliness. Unlike many adhesives, it's non-toxic and won't leave unsightly residues or stains on surfaces. Plus, its pliable texture makes it a joy to work with, even for little hands in classrooms or crafting sessions. 👦👧On the flip side, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider. While Blu Tack excels at light-duty tasks, it may not be the best choice for heavier or more permanent applications. Additionally, its vibrant blue hue might not be the most aesthetically pleasing option for some users. 🎨Overall, Bostik Blu Tack is a true unsung hero of everyday life. Its versatility, reusability, and user-friendly nature make it an indispensable tool for anyone seeking a reliable, fuss-free adhesive solution. Whether you're a busy parent, a creative soul, or a practical problem-solver, this little blue wonder is sure to become your new best friend. Embrace the magic of Blu Tack, and let your #BluHacks unleash a world of possibilities! 💙

Works well. Sticks and removes easily. Would definitely recommend this over cheaper alternatives as I have tried them and they don’t really work that well. Stick to the original.

Most people know what blu tack is, and for those who don't. It is an adhiesive that feels a bit like playdough and can be used to put things like posters onto wallsThe blu tack is easy to use. It doesn't stick to your hands. but is sticky enough to stick up whatever you need it to, like a poster on a wall for exampleIt holds well and is really long lasting. My daughter has had posters on her wall for years with no issue.And the best part? It doesn't leave any marks at all

I recently upgraded from my Kindle Fire 10 to the Kindle Fire Max 11, and I'm thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. This device has truly revolutionized my entertainment experience, deserving every bit of its 5-star rating.The 11-inch display is simply breathtaking, with vibrant colors and crystal-clear resolution. Whether I'm watching movies, TV shows, or reading e-books, the Kindle Fire Max 11's display enhances the entire experience. It's especially delightful for binge-watching series or immersing myself in captivating novels.The tablet's processing power is remarkable, evident in smooth gaming experiences, particularly with games like Minecraft and Roblox. It effortlessly handles multiple apps simultaneously, ensuring a lag-free and seamless user experience for gaming, web browsing, and productivity tasks. I've had this tablet for a while now, and its performance has been consistently outstanding.Battery life is another standout feature, lasting a long time even under heavy usage. I no longer worry about recharging as frequently as I did with previous Amazon tablets. This is particularly important for me, given my penchant for watching a lot of movies and videos.Impressive audio quality adds to the multimedia experience, delivering clear and immersive sound. The speakers make it feel like I have a portable home theater at my fingertips, enhancing enjoyment whether I'm on YouTube, Prime Video, or listening to an audiobook.Navigating the interface is intuitive, with seamless integration with Amazon services.

I have had previous amazon tablets, fire 7 and 8, and ended up giving them to my kids. They were too slow to process things, not great at gaming, overall they felt frustrating to use.This tablet fixes those things. Its nice and fast, the games work well, and its a delight to use.I got this on sale and used some vouchers I had, and at the price I paid, im extremely happy with the performance. I also bought the keyboard case and my wife uses it for work sometimes, taking orders while she's out at events.I havent actually used any samsung tabs or ipads, but I cant imagine they perform that much better at the comparable price point.The Pros;- Really nice screen, in both quality, viewing angles and size.- Fast, nippy, great performance to price.- Battery life seems good so farThe cons;- The sound quality remains ok at best. If you want to be immersed in a movie or tv show, earbuds or headphones are reccomended. For general use, its fine.- The lack of apps in the amazon app store remains a con. There are workarounds if you put in a little work, though.Overall, extremely happy with this purchase

Exceeded Expectations!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 May 2019Configuration: Without AppleCare+Verified Purchase
I don't often write reviews on Amazon, but occasionally, I come across a product that deserves a bit of extra praise - not that Apple needs the extra publicity!I purchased a set of Apple AirPods as an alternative to using my excellent, but somewhat bulky B&O headphones when I travel on the train into London - for regular, everyday use if you will. I'd not really considered these as a realistic option for headphones, but came across some very positive reviews and the more I read about them, the more I thought they may be good. So I decided to take a (albeit low) risk and buy a set.Wow! I can't believe how good they actually are. They produce an amazing sound, far bigger and fuller than I thought possible, especially without having insulation around them like some ear bud headphones, to block out extraneous sounds. They don't actually block out extraneous sound anymore than the cheap ones that come with an iPhone, but the sound quality and weight of the sound is such that it mostly overcomes this - you can hear through it, so to speak!I tried these on Classical music with Mahler's second symphony and they sounded epic, making the finale of the piece really full and meaty, I also tried the with some brass band (Black Dyke Band playing Metropolis 1927), and they made the band sound full and fruity, and today at work I've had on some Rush (A show of hands), Peter Gabriel (So!) and Steve Hackett (Genesis Revisited II). The AirPods make easy work of all these. I realise that these choices somewhat date me! :-)I also found using them with my phone really good as well. Occasionally I detected a slight delay in one ear, as though the radio signal were interrupted, but no problem and have't experienced that whilst playing music! I love the freedom of no wires for phone use. No tangles today!Hopefully won't be updating this in a few weeks, but initial thoughts are that these are a cracking product.

Airpods really are the future
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 July 2020Configuration: Without AppleCare+Verified Purchase
Airpods have been out a fair while now, and if i'm honest i didn't really like the cost of the product against other items such as the Anker equivalents which are 4 times cheaper. But sometimes it is true what they say, you do get what you pay for.I purchased these for a sole reason, and maybe thats why i didn't want to spend the 4 times the price of the Anker equivalent. I wanted these for running, to pair with my Apple Watch.Now with the Anker product which i purchased first, they come with those rubber ear bits that are supposed to be put into the ear for comfort. Very quickly i found them to be uncomfortable and when running, they would assist in blocking out sound if they got sweat inside, which inevitably they did. Also the sound quality and ability to talk for phone calls was terrible on the Anker equivalents.So i bit the bullet and spent the extra to get Airpods...........Well done Apple.......Well Done!They just work, and I alongside many other people im sure, just want a product that works.Typical Apple box and packaging, its all well done and kept relatively minimal.Open up and out come the Airpods case, one flick of the lid and my iPhone found the airpods and already named them ""Daniels Airpods"", i mean thats pretty cool right?Without failure they just paired as soon as they were in my ears, i didnt have to go into bluetooth settings (which is how they link pair and operate) they just paired.Sound is way better than i expected, and i have previously always been a fan of Apple Earphones.The tap functions which are changeable in settings on your phone are great and reliable (just takes some getting use to) and the sound quality for phone calls is superb. People can hear me clearly no matter the situation and vice versa.These are another example of pure innovation or things that just work out the box, with minimal interaction and provide great value for money.The case itself holds up to 100% charge, and so do each of the earphones. Depending on the device and your settings they support various gesture controls, which include removal of an earphone will either continue music on one earphone or stop depending on the settings, and removal of both earphones can stop music (if set in settings) but when plugging back into your ears they automatically play where the left off.They are very clever indeed. And they also link to Find my device in the cloud services which help you locate them if lost.They let you ping for earphones and i believe the case just incase you misplace them.As i said, i originally bought these for running, and honestly i can say that i completed the same 5 mile route that i did with the Anker Equivalents, and i honestly didn't get them slip out my ears, or block sound or become uncomfortable, and i do sweat alot when running.I now use these everywhere, in the garden, in the house, at night. They have just added a different way of listening to music for me even in the house. Because its quick, and easy, reliable and good quality sounds.No more pairing of large bluetooth headphones and over ear bins, these are great.They are expensive, but are absolutely worth the money.

This seamless transition between on and off modes enhances the overall user experience.The sound quality of the AirPods is generally well-regarded, offering clear audio and decent bass. The H1 chip inside the AirPods ensures a stable wireless connection and efficient power management.While the 2nd generation AirPods lack some of the more advanced features found in the Pro version, such as noise cancellation and a customizable fit, they still provide a reliable and convenient wireless audio solution for those who prioritize ease of use and seamless integration with Apple devices.

At last - ear buds that don't keep falling out!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2024Configuration: Without AppleCare+Verified Purchase
I was reluctant to order these, I have already tried two other sets of cheaper brand earbuds that I just cannot get to stay in my ears, and didn't I want to risk spending so much money on another set that keep falling out.However, I never had the problem of my previous wired apple earphones falling out, and these Gen 2s looked the same shape as the wired ones on the photo (unlike Gen 3), so I decided to take the risk.Really glad I did!  Took them out of them charger, popped them straight in my ears without having to wiggle them to try to get them to stay in, phone recognised them and connected straight away, and away we go!  They feel very secure and the sound is great!Gen 3 look a different shape to these, so I am not sure whether they would stay in my ears so well, so I am glad I opted for the (cheaper) Gen 2!

First dslr for me.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 July 2012Verified Purchase
I went with Nikon for my first dslr as I was given an old Nikon lens and this product was released right at the same time.I used to take pictures years ago, but uni got in the way and now i have time to start again a bit more seriously.I know a fair bit about tech and liked the face that the canon 550 is basically a 600d without the flippy screen, so was available for less money. The new 650 looks like a major improvement with touch being added in. However, I love the build quality and image quality I am getting with the Nikon kit lens and indeed old manual lenses.I shoot raw and use lightroom 4 to develop the images and the detail retained is impressive.Had the camera for less than a month and used it when the weather allows, so im over 1000 shots and the learning curve for me has been non existent.Live view is a must have for me, its not always better than the viewfinder, but its a great feature for low angles, landscapes or any situation where you want to frame the shot precisely. The old springy switch on the 3100 is replaced with a regular button, which I was down about to begin with, but i like the button just as much (having held a 3100 about twice) and its still in the best location for it.I have yet to use the video mode for any real purpose. The creative possibilities there are good. The few times i have tried it is during a consort (in a marquee) and an acoustic set (in a barn, my musical settings have been obscure recently) and the audio was clear and true. The record button is on the top behind the shutter button, and its easy to get at, I prefer that to it being where the live view button is placed, as I use video much less.Also 24mp might be a trick to get people excited about the high count, but I like having the high resolution. As a last resort, I can crop without worrying too much and pick out the composition I was trying to get at the time. Noise and grain are dealt with extremely well and even at high ISO - up to and sometimes beyond 3200 - the results are pleasing, or at least mild enough to be easily recoverable in lightroom.Holding the camera is comfortable for me, the only flaw I could pick in the design is the aperture/exposure button location. Its behind the shutter release and to the right slightly. Its not horrible, but I would prefer it on the other side of the camera near the fn button (used to change ISO). I am left handed, and that might be the cause of that issue. The camera is not particularly heavy, I could carry this all day happily, whereas thats not true with bulkier pro dslrs.Battery life hasn't been as issue for me either, but make sure it is fully charged before you intend to use, as it may not last a full days intensive use!Everything else is well thought out and just works. All the menus are straight forward enough, and there are options available to setup the camera pretty much to whatever way you find it works best for you. Guide mode is not something I intend to use, but its very good at taking a step back and explaining all the controls and when or why to use them. Sample images are even used to explain the concepts further.Overall, if you are looking for a new dslr, want fantastic images, the ability to record quality video and perhaps learn to improve your photography after using a compact or bridge camera, this is for you. Nikon has a huge range of available lenses, some of which are affordable, but many of the better quality ones easily exceed the price of the camera. It is important to note that this is a dx format camera.There are two types of Nikon dslr. The smaller dx and the full frame fx. dx cameras have lenses designed specifically for them and are identified by the term af-s.Older af lenses will fit this camera but auto focus will not work. The focus motor is built into the lens on the af-s lenses whereas the bigger cameras have a built in motor and can accept any lens. This is not a major issue as many af-s lenses are widely available - and amazon tend to have good prices on each of them!Finally the camera has a crop factor of 1.5x. So every lens' focal length is multiplied by 1.5.For example the kit 18-55mm is approximately equiv to a 27 - 82mm lens in 35mm terms.Hope this helps as its way more complicated than it needs to be. If you get the camera, thankfully most of the details don't matter so much.[...]I found these reviews from Jared Polin to be helpful before I bought the camera.Enjoy taking pictures!

Nikon D3200 and the casual snapper.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 March 2013Verified Purchase
Having progressed from being a manual SLR user (2 Zeniths - Zenith badge and lenses but Pentax works inside, go figure! Then a Minolta) and the hassle of to carry around film, spare batteries (viewfinder and flash unit micro batteries), I moved to a teensy Olympus C300 but rapidly tired of its lack of anything but basic controls. Next was a Fujifilm S7000 which, until one of the internal filters failed (no reds!), could only really be criticised for its propensity to eat batteries. Which brought me to buying the Nikon D3200 and 18 - 55mm VR lens kit, UV filter, Case and other bits and pieces.For a casual snapper (I use it for internal pictures for websites and outside for anything that takes my fancy), the biggest ""chore"" was reading through the extensive user's manual. The camera is an absolute joy to use and, once the manual has been digested, exceptionally easy to change settings to match circumstances - auto picture stability for normal shots is a fantastic boon for the near geriatric user (of which I'm one) - battery life is very, very good, a high speed 32Gb card means no running out of picture space in a hurry and the price (Amazon price of £403.50) is exceptional for what you get. The only comment, not a criticism, I would make is that it is a little heavy and that a good neck strap and/or carry case essential for we dodderers.From my 5 star rating, you can see that I absolutely love this camera, it does everything that this casual snapper requires with the minimum of fuss, takes great pictures and (in the credibility stakes) looks the part. It may not live up to the high expectations of professional (or professional level amateur) photographers but for the casual snapper, I cannot recommend this camera highly enough.

Good but beware back focus error!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 May 2014Verified Purchase
Most people will gravitate to this camera because of the excellent reviews that appear for it all over the respected photography websites. That and the currently lavish 24 megapixel sensor. And it's a good camera for sure but not the massive leap in quality you'd expect if you're migrating from compact camera to SLR.My previous camera was a Panasonic Lumix TZ8 which was a great camera for its class. A really nice compact that worked extremely well and turned out some great photos. I expected the D3200 to shoot me into another league and it didn't really. It was better but it didn't really knock my socks off. But why?Partly this was to do with the 18-55mm kit lens you get with the camera. It's good but not great. But I also bought a superior Nikon 55-300mm lens and the photos were still distinctly lacking. So what's going on?After a bit of research I found that part of the problem was quality control. It turns out that the manufacturer of the actual product in China is known for shoddy final setup. That's to say the camera is fine but the final adjustments aren't performed correctly.This means that the D3200 ships with a back focus error. It's a small error but it really means that the photos you get are a bit soft and the overall effect is that what should be a 24 megapixel camera produces shots that look like a 12 megapixel one.It's important to note that I've had two of these cameras. The first I returned to Amazon who quickly sent me a replacement. The replacement had exactly the same problem.So, what to do? Well I rang Nikon and told their extremely helpful support people about the issue. The chap I spoke to didn't sound surprised and organised a return for repair. They paid for postage and the turnaround was quick.Now my D3200 works very well. The shots are sharp and my faith has been restored.There are some sites on the net that have identified this error and recommend a 'home fix'. This involves removing the lens, flipping up the mirror and adjusting one of the mirror stops so that the mirror shifts the focal plane a little. Apparently this will bodge it satisfactorily but you do sacrifice autofocus point placement accuracy. The actual error lies in the position setting of the sensor itself which is raised and lowered by a few screws - an adjustment which the casual punter most certainly cannot do.So, a good entry level SLR that might need to go back to the lovely people at Nikon for adjustment. But if it's still under guarantee then that's an inconvenience rather than a disaster. It's worth noting that this might also occur in the newer D3300 since it's a manufacturer final setup error and not a model fault. Incidentally, at the moment of this review, the D3300 is significantly more expensive than the D3200. There are some very minor differences between the two but read between the lines before you shell out for a camera that may not be a whole lot better than the D3200.

The unit is small, perfect for slipping in your pocket, or bag whilst on the go. It takes a while to charge, but I think that’s the norm with powerbanks, it does however charge phones quickly and last a reasonably long length of time between charges.I highly recommend!

First impressions, great but.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2024Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Perhaps I should have read the reviews in a bit more detail. The description, one of the smallest and Lightest 10000mAh external batteries, ultra-compact swayed me. Thinking it would be ideal for the Missus to put in her handbag to take on holiday I opted for this model having spent days trawling through and reading about the competition.Good points. Its reasonably fast at charging and looks well made. Its got a decent 18 month warranty. It does not have a usb c connection so I am guessing the design is a tad dated but not a biggie but just remember not to forget your charging cable.Portability, well its not exactly made for a handbag or manbag. Weighing in at 187g on the scales just now its the same weight as most mobiles so if your carrying both you will certainly know it. If you happen to have a Samsung Galaxy Ultra at 225g you are not going to hike this combination around for long. So its into the backpack, satchel, shopping bag, glove compartment for this beauty.So initial impressions are thats its a good charger but ""lightweight"" needs to be viewed in context.

Great that this stops charging when fully charged, and the indicator lights shut off, and it’s working really well after a few cycles. It’s an elegant size and weight so very happy with that too. Only (liveable) downside is that it doesn’t charge or discharge with a USB-C connector, which is the reason I have dropped the 5 stars to a 4 - other banks have at least a USB-C input option, and the latest ones have USB-C in/out as well as USB-A out and micro-USB in.

So lets start off with what you are buying; a 10,000mah rechargable battery pack, charged by an included micro-USB cable, and charging your mobile via a not included USB cable.So, those that complain about not being able to recharge the battery pack via USB-C, you should have bought a battey pack that included this.For those that say it shoud have been a USB-C output, it can charge at 2,400mah, this is well quick, faster than all wireless, and most cabled connections. If you had wanted a usb-c charger, maybe you should have purchased one. It is like buying a Ford and saying, it is not a BMW. erm, yes, it is a Ford!It has 4 lights that are indicative of the remaining power, (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%) for those that say well it does not display the exact power, if you really believe the display on those that do, good luck to you. Those that do generally drop from the remaining power (circa 10%) to zero in an instant, I know!The quality of the Anker unit good, it does what it should, enough said...

replaced my cooker
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2024Verified Purchase
As I was impressed with my first Ninja I bought another one as a gift for another.  The reason I really like the Ninjas is because the one I have has replaced my cooker, except for special ocasions such as Christmas as that is when four burners and two ovens are get a lot of use.The two Ninja baskets are quite spacious so one can cook a meal in them, for up to two people.  However, the Ninja can also cook plenty of chicken so one can cook enough chicken for a family of four, cook the chips then quickly reheat the chicken so up to four can be fed.I have cooked fried chicken, chips, pies, fish, beef joints even a duck in my Ninja.  It also bakes bread, one can make cakes in it (I haven't baked a cake in mine, yet!).For cooking fish I simply batter the fish, drop it in hot oil for around 30 seconds then remove it and p-lace it in the Ninja to air fry it.  As for chips I use the Max Crisp setting for one minute after they have cooked with the Air Fry one, to give them that extra bit of crispiness.Although the Ninkas are good for all sorts of cooking and can cook everything from fried chicken to jam there is one thing I tried and won't try again as it was too time consuming and too costly.  Roasting coffee beans in a Ninja is something I do not advise as coffee beans can be cooked in less than 1/10 of the time on a stove and at much less cost.  When I tried to roast coffee I eneded up giving in and finishing them off on the stove as the amount and energy used and the amount of time wasted was just too much.One thing I do find the Ninja good for is cooking food from frozen.  I simply read the cooking instructions then reduce the temperature by 10c and reduce the time a little and the Ninja cooks the food very well and in slightly less time.I also like the ""Sync"" and ""Match"" functions as it makes cooking a bit simpler.Now for the best nit... using a Ninja saves both time and energy thus saves money.  The Ninja can rapidly heat up so there's no waiting 10 minutes for an oven to preheat and it uses far less energy.  A typical main oven will burn over 3kWh of energy and the Ninja burns less than 1/3 of that.  With the cavities being small it takes far less time to heat and much less energy to maintain the heat.  Less energy use = less cost = more savings.  It is a simple mathematical equation to work out that a Ninja saves money and soon pays for itself.  If one saves £3 per week, on energy costs, then cooking with the Ninja means the savings will pay for the initial cost of purchase in around one year.  After that first year the £3 per week is a saving that can be used for other things.Overall the Ninjas have impressed me and so much that I have started using them for gifts.  They are; easy to use, easy to keep clean, they are cost effective, energy saving, money saving devices that every kitchen should have.  Ninjas are very good quality and excellent value so I am recommending them.

One of the best out there.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024Verified Purchase
I've had 3 air fryers over time before this one. I currently use this, and an airfryer oven as my day to day go to items.Packaged well, looks good and so simple to use. 10 minutes study on the manual, which also comes with a recipie booklet and cooking times as this system cooks very fast! And you are ready to go.Using it. Select which draw to use, select cooking mode, airfry, roast, reheat, dehydrate etc and select time and temp. Press round button and you are off.Want 2 draws? Same time and temp? Press drawer 2 button and click match and then round button to start. Drawers can also work independently, with selecting sync after setting different temp on draws and temps. So you can cook each to finish at same time if one cooks in say 17 minutes at 180 and the other cooks in 8 minutes at 160 they finish together. Works perfectly.Cleaning is a doddle. Recommend getting paper liners to help cleanup. Trust me on this. A quick wash of the drawers with washing up liquid and no scrubbing needed and you are done.Honestly this is the the best airfryer going. Pay the extra for it compared to the others out there. Max crisp alone for the last 2 minutes with chips brings them out crispy and fluffy.My wife always said if a house fire happened she would grab the kids and the hounds.Me, it would be my air fryers.Have done everything in this from a simple soft boiled egg (yes it does that, 7 minutes shell on at 200 and you have a soft boiled egg) to a full Sunday roast.

""Game changer"" gets used too often, but this time it's deserved!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2024Verified Purchase
I happened to have an unfortunate accident with my old air fryer when this one was on offer (my wife is suspicious of this coincidence), so it seemed like a no-brainer to up my game, and get the dual drawer Ninja.It's a big machine, but given the fact it holds more than double the quantity of my old Tower air fryer, it's not even twice as wide. The drawers hold (up to) a generous 4.75 litres in each, so if you're doing chips for instance, 1 drawer will easily feed a family of four.The controls are quite intuitive, and easy enough to use - press the number for which drawer you want to use, turn the dial to select the program, then change the temperature/time accordingly. There's a match button that will copy the settings from the first drawer to the second, if you're doing the same thing in both, and there is a sync option so that you can do different things, at different settings and differnet timings, but get them to finish at the same time.The food cooks well, the first meal we did was boneless chicken thighs and chips using the sync function. The chicken was nice and tender and cooked through, and the chips were crispy, but still fluffy inside. I turned the chicken halfway through, and shook the chips on occasion (as recommended in the instructions) to ensure that the weer cooked evenly.The manual comes with a timing guide, which gives you guide times and temperatures to use with frequently cooked items, and these seem pretty accurate from our usage so far. There are also a number of recipes you can try.The unit itself has hand-holds a the bottom, making it easier to move around, and the outside doesn't get too hot to handle.Our last air fryer had a vent at the back that blew straight out, which would cause condensation on the wall (and lead to having to replace a plug socket). The Ninja has a vent for each drawer, and they point upwards, which prevents the condensation issue (unless you place it under low cupboards).All in all, this is a great piece of kit, my only gripe is that the right hand drawer doesn't slide in as smoothly as the first, but that's just a minor thing.

Fun and Innovative Pleasure Device with Some Room for Improvement
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 July 2023Verified Purchase
I recently purchased the LOVENSE Lush 3 Bluetooth Vibrator, and overall, it has been a unique and enjoyable experience. The app-controlled feature, wireless remote control, and unlimited custom vibration modes are undoubtedly the highlights of this pleasure device.The ability to control the vibrations through the smartphone app adds an exciting element of surprise and intimacy, especially for long-distance couples. The wireless remote control functionality also comes in handy during solo play or when engaging in adventurous scenarios with a partner.The feature that truly sets the LOVENSE Lush 3 apart is the unlimited custom vibration modes. Being able to tailor the vibrations to my liking has allowed me to explore and discover new sensations, making each session personalized and exciting.The build quality of the Lush 3 is solid, and the silicone material feels soft and comfortable. The discreet design ensures that it can be worn comfortably in various settings without drawing unnecessary attention.However, there are a few areas where I believe there is room for improvement. Firstly, the connection between the vibrator and the app can be inconsistent at times, leading to occasional disruptions in the experience. Though it's not a deal-breaker, it can be a bit frustrating when the connection drops unexpectedly.Additionally, the battery life could be better. While it's not terrible, I would appreciate a more extended playtime between charges, especially for longer sessions.Despite these minor drawbacks, the LOVENSE Lush 3 remains a fun and innovative pleasure device that has added excitement and pleasure to my intimate experiences. If the connection reliability and battery life are improved in future versions, this vibrator could easily become a five-star product.As with any personal pleasure device, individual experiences may vary, so I recommend doing thorough research and reading other customer reviews to ensure that the LOVENSE Lush 3 is the right fit for your desires and preferences.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 February 2024Scent Name: Cheirosa '62Verified Purchase
I bought this perfume mist for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas (it was on the list!) and she loves it. It has a lovely scent of pistachio and salted caramel that is not too strong or overpowering. It is very refreshing and uplifting, and it lasts for a long time on her skin and hair. It is also vegan, cruelty-free, and paraben-free, which is important to me as a parent. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a fun and delicious fragrance for themselves or their kids. It is worth every penny.

Yes, this range of Sol De Janeiro body sprays are all the rage on Tik Tok but it is horrendously overpriced for what it is.  The pink passion fruit one smells divine but it fades after an hour and you need to reapply constantly throughout the day to maintain the scent, which means 30ml gone in days.  There are equally scrummy scents out there for a fraction of the price...  4*.

Only took 24 hours to arrive (if that really) and as one would do, i ripped open the box and used 2 sprays to try it.... And get me through the rest of my work day.... Imagining my upcoming holiday 😂 as i work from home, i usually just mooch around in loungewear and so today i just put on the same jumper i had on yesterday after lunch as it was a tad chilly in the house and my lord!!! The smell is still there, and is still giving off some good strong whiffs of salted caramel and pistachios.... Sooooo 2 sprays for 24 hours of scent... Or two full days, makes me one very happy buyer, honestly take the plunge, you wont be upset by it, 😊

Outstanding budget headset - With a catch
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 February 2022Edition: Headset OnlyVerified Purchase
The Oculus/Meta quest 2 - Facebook/Meta’s current leading headset being sold to the masses.An amazing VR headset capable of running VR games standalone using it’s modded Snapdragon 865/Qualcomm XR2 chip or playing them linked to a computer, wirelessly and with a wire.Using its inside out tracking with a 6DOF, it can track on all axis: Roll, yaw, pitch, X, Y and Z meaning you can move and look around realistically and almost entirely life like.In future there may even be full body tracking support, using mirrors and the cameras which sounds promising as right now, the quest 2 already features very functional hand tracking.The Quest 2 on it’s own is capable of running games like VRChat and beat sabre consistently at 72fps, if you choose to increase the refresh rate it can potentially hit 80fps and 90fps on moderate worlds in VRChat and less demanding games like beat sabre.A sleek design and surprisingly light weight, the headset itself has no issues aesthetically, it looks and feels pleasing.With a 1832x1920 per eye resolution the image is crisp and clear, standalone and linked to a computer; though, with a computer you can bring out the full potential of the headset, using its 120hz feature and fully utilising the maximum resolution of the headset you can’t get a better experience for the price.However;There are caveats to this.As an amazing headset as it is, it is still cheap in comparison to the rest, and this should be noted.The saying goes “You get what you pay for.” and this is true even here.The quest 2 has a very very short charging cable which cannot be used for linking to a computer outside of sitting down, it works at around 300-400mbps so it is completely capable of being used as a link cable but it does not do it flawlessly all the time, with this bit rate you are limited in visual fidelity.As you can adjust the bit rate to be higher in the Oculus debug tool, this cable won’t allow you to go much higher than 250 which provides very little impact in image quality compared to the default 150; I find myself scaling it up to 500 to see a noticeable change, as below this the compression is very real.Any cable that is USBC 3.1 or 3.2 will work just fine for link but the faster and more well built ones will work far better, the one I use is capable of 2.9GBPS (2900mbps) and works quite well, but even then there are still some compression artifacts.On the note of linking, some computers (desktops specially as any laptop I have tried which supports USBC charges the headset fine) do not charge the headset when linked, this is a motherboard power distribution issue as some do not distribute enough power to the ports to charge the headset, most are 5-10watts which will not charge the headset and instead let it slowly drain.In my case mine did not charge at all, it is not an issue of motherboard quality, some just do not give enough power.I use a 850w gold Corsair PSU on a ASUS B550F and found this to be an issue however, with my laptops I did not.On top of this, most laptops will not run the games you wish to play at higher than 45FPS.There are exceptions like beat sabre and other east to run games but at that point you’d be using the headset standalone rather than linked, using the link you’d be wanting to play boneworks, blade and sorcery or VRChat.The minimum spec I found to run these games smoothly at 72/80fps was a 1660 and 12GB of DDR4 2400/2666 ram on a recent 4 core cpu (I5 8th/9th Gen or a Ryzen 5)You can alternatively up the refresh rate to 120hz and make use of the 60fps space warp but in my experience it does not warp correctly, as 60fps is perceived as relatively smooth by the eye anyway the space warp creates issues.You can turn it off in settings but it does not help much either way on or off.If you cannot meet the 72fps target your best bet is 90hz and running 45FPS with space warp enabled.There have been rumours of a new space warp being released that works far better which would help many users but how true it is I’m unsure.Now for 90fps and 120fps, my 1080ti and Ryzen 7 3700X can barely keep up.For boneworks and such there is no issue, adaptive resolution can help there but, for games like vrchat it struggles heavily on maximum resolution.I find myself tuning it down to about 1700 per eye to hit 90fps and 1400 per eye for 120fps.This is just for link, with air link you may have a better experience using a RTX card as they have better encoders than my 1080ti however, I’ve found I can hardly run 72fps on virtual desktop half the time, I use a 5ghz 1gbps router that is almost always unclogged, granted I’m over wifi and not using ethernet, your experience may be better than mine.I don’t have complaints for air link other than how poor it runs sometimes; it will occasionally stutter heavily because of frame rate fluctuations, not because of my router.Air link runs better than virtual desktop but still has its issues along with far more noticeable compression.The head strap is quite comfortable contrary to popular belief, it’s just a bit hard to fit right and get comfortable in, people recommend you use the top strap to adjust it and not the back strap unless you want it tight but in my experience the headset ends up slipping off my head if I do not use the back strap tight to my skull, the top strap pushes it up my head and will cause it to fall off slowly.I recommend using a combination of both, but keeping the strap at the back somewhat loose but tight enough it won’t let your headset shake around.Alongside this, the headsets facial interface creaks very quickly, within a week of light usage mine began to sort of rub against the plastic and make a creaking sound.This seems like it’s inevitable but it should not happen so soon, by product of a cheap headset.But as for complaints that is all.Thrill seeker throughly stress tested his quest 2 and even dropped it from 10ft and it lived, it’s durability is not a concern, but the interface is a very big weak point, even in his video it was the first thing to break.If you’re curious of the video I’m talking about, you can find it on YouTube: “Thrillseeker quest 2 extreme torture test”I think this concludes my review.TLDR;Amazing headset, cheap price, works good alone, works good on link and air link but needs good specs minimum i5 8th gen/Ryzen 5 and GTX 1660 for a smooth experience, facial interface gives in after a while, headset is light and comfy, appearance is nice.

Really great VR but you’ll buy extras
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2023Edition: Headset OnlyVerified Purchase
This is my first VR headset so I’m no expert, and while I’d happily call myself a nerd in many areas, tech probably isn’t one of them so this review is going to be of most use to people that are not experts in the field.I wanted a VR that was going to be fairly future proof, I wanted to have lots of options to choose from so I could learn what I liked to do in VR and I wanted the experience to be high quality. This headset has done all that.The interface is easy to get used to and the controllers are pretty simple. The image quality is great once you get the eye pieces adjusted to you and the headset sat at the right level. It’s bright and you’ll spend a lot of time just admiring stuff at first.There’s a huge range of games/experiences to choose from, most you’ll have to buy but there is a good selection of free stuff and also free trials so you can work out what you’ll enjoy without wasting your money.Beat Sabre which came in the bundle I bought is fun and very addictive.I’ve found mine excellent for doing Boxing and Combat workouts via the FitXR subscription app, so that’s an extra expense but it’s such good exercise with so many options I’m fine with that.However, while the headset is comfortable to begin with and for sessions only lasting about 20-30mins without too much movement it’s fine, I did find I started to get pressure discomfort on my cheeks from the weight.So I bought an ‘elite’ head strap from a 3rd party that has a solid, fully adjustable, cushioned strap with a band going over the top of the head at the front taking the pressure off. It’s made it so much more comfortable to do lengthy high intensity workouts. It also has a built in battery for those longer sessions.The controllers are great, the batteries last a surprisingly long time and they feel robust. However I’ve bought silicone covers that have a hand strap as I am worried I’ll forget the wrist string one day and throw them across the room accidentally. It also makes them a bit more comfortable to hold and less sweaty on the grip.All round it’s been a great experience but one I’ve felt the need to enhance a bit which has been an extra expense.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2024Edition: Headset OnlyVerified Purchase
This VR headset is a must-have for beginners in virtual reality simulation. I found it to be engaging and fun, playing for several hours at a time and being emersed completely. However, it has some faults, such as low-quality guardian camera mode (which is responsible for switching from a virtual interface to cameras in real life), some games running slow by the meta app, the elite strap getting uncomfortable after a while, and pretty bad tension headaches after long gaming sessions. Though it was super cool, I had to refund this because it was difficult to play without these issues which I hope is addressed for the Quest 3.Overall, I highly suggest people buy the Quest 3 when it gets cheaper.

Accurate and Faithful Recreation of the Screen-Used Prop
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 November 2023Verified Purchase
The standard edition release of the 14th Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver is an accurate and faithful recreation of the screen-used prop. This toy is a sturdy rendition which works well for display, cosplay and active play. The sonic stacks-up well against other sonic screwdriver models released by Character Options and has a full-set of light and sound effects. The price point is high, but the toy feels as it will last over the years, without fear of damage or wear. This item is worth picking-up if you are an avid fan, loyal collector or new viewer looking to take home a piece of the action!

Love this, another win from Character Toys - the amount of care and attention that goes into these is amazing, really good replica of the prop and very reasonable RRP, though it’s difficult to find a seller that’s selling them that price. High quality product

Amazon emailed some English instructions but as it turned out, the colsole didn't work anyway and won't even let us finish the set up. This is the third faulty or damaged product we gave been sent recently. I'm in a wheelchair and getting faulty products to the post office to be returned to you is not easy for me.

Excellent handheld console
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 December 2023Platform For Display: OLED WhiteEdition: ConsoleVerified Purchase
Full and pretty long Nintendo Switch OLED review, from a serious gamer.Ummed and arred about this console for quite some time before taking the plunge and buying it with a bundle, case, game and SD card. I have other individual reviews for those products on my profile. When I say I am serious about gaming I am playing at least 5 times a week have been playing now for over 2 decades and have had all the latest consoles, handhelds and PC’s so am confident I can give a full review of this console. I haven't purchased online so couldn't comment on that side of the Switch but everything else I have engaged with.First of nice and simple I like it I’m also glad I have it. The OLED Switch is the one I think you should go for in my personal opinion, having played on the normal Switch and seeing the size of the Lite Switch I feel like for the extra money the OLED is the best choice. Also the Switch lite is unable to dock and remove it’s controllers which is half the point of the Switch in my opinion. The blacks and colours really pop on the small OLED screen, and the majority of games really do look visually great. (More on the TV bit later.) You get that little bit extra screen size with the OLED but at no extra addition to the console size. The screen size is really decent, I was surprised in a good way that I wasn’t struggling to see everything on the screen or read text. Mainly as they know the games are on Switch zoom in and the text becomes enlarged so you can easily read it. Hand held visuals I’d rate 8/10.The games are really well done, as anyone will know Nintendo know what they are doing, and you get the full Nintendo experience here, it is one that they have perfected over the years. There are also new ones to engage with new player, but veterans will feel at home with returning classics and updated character games which make you feel right at home. The online store too also has what seems like an endless (it isn’t) number of games on sale all the time, it’s around about 1100 at any one given time, these range from really basic games that are only found on the store which can be £0.90 or the known Nintendo titles that have 20% off the main price. But there is something for everyone some of the smaller titles are fun, well designed and easy going, I have enjoyed both Lost in Bermuda and Trifox games from the store which I picked up for next to nothing. This is really nice coming from console and PC gaming were the price of gams can exceed £100 so paying 90p is a really nice change. Even the cheap games are well done too which is nice, it seems like the developers do take their time with the games, I assume that this is the case as the switch store is the only store front where you can sell games for the switch platform. Games I’d rate 9/10The console itself is a nice design visually one that does look simple yet modern. However I feel like it could be a little too flat/ thin for those used to a controller or with slightly larger hands. Whilst you can buy ergonomic attachments or stand-alone controllers, this is for the standard controllers that come with the Switch. I fell as if the Steam Deck design is far superior the thicker handles fit in the hand much better for comfortability and for longer periods of gaming. The charging point too is also at the bottom, which gets in the way more than you might think and you unable to stand the console up really when charging, without bending or resting the console on the charging cable, something I don’t like doing. The stand and buttons that you press do feel good too, my only gripe is the back bumper buttons aren’t spaced as well as I would have liked and those with slightly larger fingers may find it hard to hit the right bumper button as required. Having said that for children which is probably the larger intended audience it probably works really well, also there is no stick drift for me yet, and the buttons feel like they have been designed to last for a long time. Design/ ergonomics of the console I’d rate 6/10.The TV mode is the big, advertised part of the Switch and probably why it got its name. This is something I really haven’t done all that much, but I will say that I have a 4k 32” all singing all dancing gaming monitor which on my PC looks gorgeous, absolutely stunning visuals, (review on my page.) Now I know it isn’t as powerful yes and I wasn’t expecting it to be as good but I wasn’t exactly blown away (I played Lego Star Wars,) again it’s ok but I wasn’t impressed, its 720p output really isn’t all that much in today’s market with ultra 4k, ray tracing and the works, so I’ve kept mine in handheld mode pretty much 99% of the time of ownership. As I have a PC this really wasn’t my intended use for the Switch so if it is something you’re thinking about having as a main home entertainment system for the TV I would look at the Xbox series S, for slightly cheaper you’re going to get a much better picture. Visual for TV mode I’d give a 4/10.The portability factor is good. Its big enough that you can see a lot of stiff on the screen at any one given time, but its small enough to fit into my jogging bottom front pocket and fits into a bag and can be easily carried around without weighing you down all day. It’s something that I like to be able to pick up and put down I can take it to work play a couple levels of Mario and then put it away again ready for whenever that maybe. Having a case is a must, as the joy cons could easily get damaged as well as the screen could become easily scratched if it is lose in a bag all day. Portability I’d rate 10/10.Overall, I really do genuinely love the Switch, I recently sold my consoles as I am fully PC now but have still kept my switch. The games are great its portable and it looks surprisingly good in handheld mode on the OLED variant. Yes, the ergonomics aren’t perfect and yes, I would like it if they were better as we know it is possible as we have the Steam deck to prove that they can be better. However, if it is that much of an issue there are excellent 3rd party add-ons you can get to make the Switch more comfortable for those longer game sessions. This is something I think people of all ages and game abilities will like, the majority of games are fun, and it’s nice not to have to shoot something all the time for once, (there are shooters for those of you who want them.) I highly recommend it for handheld gaming at home or on the move, I wouldn’t recommend it if you are looking for this as your only gaming console and your looking to play this mostly on a TV, I would as mentioned have to recommend a PS4/5 or Xbox s/x for gaming on the TV.Hope this helps someone make their decision, I think you'll like it from what I have experienced with the Switch so far.

The Best Version of the Switch - ignore the reviews based on Scapler Prices
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2021Platform For Display: OLED WhiteEdition: ConsoleVerified Purchase
Thoughts of a 51 year old gamer dad.I wish people would stop faulting the system because of People’s Greed. The Switch isn’t at fault - it’s scalpers and resellers that use bots to buy up all the stock in a heartbeat and then resell at 2-5 times MSRP. The problem with the current Pre-Order system is merchants like Wally, Amazonian, Besties Buy, and others allow this practice to continue to happen. Your anger needs to be directed at them for not doing something to prevent this. Limiting sales of 1 per house hold, Address, or verified IP address would limit this but all these retailers seem either too dumb or just don’t care to enact it because they are selling their stock. This same issue has happened with PS5s and the newer Xbox’s too. However Tar-jaé 🎯 does limit their sales. Which is how I was able to get a system for my son and myself. One of each color. Anyway I didn’t want this to be the review of the purchase - because I understand peoples frustration, just they are taking their anger out on the product instead of the real reason that is upsetting them.As to the Switch OLED, it is by far the superior system. There is a premium feel to this new unit compared to the older version. For and extra $50 you are getting double memory space out of the box, a true glass OLED screen which makes your whole library of Switch games come back alive. There is no comparison….the OLED screen is stunningly beautiful. You can really tell on any game that has black on screen. Luigi’s Mansion, Metroid Dread, and any underground Mario level, and Breath of the Wild will simply take your breath away…again. Then the build quality is just incredible. The bezel on the front (what there is of it) is metal, the body length kick stand and side rails are all metal. So, Joy Cons not only lock into place but feel incredibly sturdy this time around. No Hamburglar “wobble wobble” - if you get that joke you’re my people.  A newer designed dock with has 4K upscaling built in? And the included HDMI cable is also 4K compatible this time around….those all inflate the cost of production so I can’t see that being a coincidence. Nintendo has plans to use those upgrades.  So all the complaints I’ve heard about the $50 price bump seem nonsensical. I’d honestly say it’s worth more then $350 but Nintendo did what it did to keep it at that price point - including scaling down the packaging this time around to save on cost where they could….which I would rather have more system and less cardboard.So when you can, and find these in the wild or back on retail shelves - Don’t line a scalpers pocket - you should definitely upgrade your system if you’re a Nintendo fan. I personally love the system and my son loves his. They were well worth the retail price.

The Nintendo Switch OLED is a fantastic iteration that elevates the gaming experience to new heights. The enhanced picture quality on the vibrant OLED screen is an absolute delight, making every game pop with vividness and clarity that truly mesmerizes.One of its standout features is the improved battery life, allowing for extended gaming sessions without interruption. However, it's understandable to wish for a ""next-gen"" leap in performance, considering the evolving gaming landscape.Despite this longing, the Switch OLED beautifully bridges the gap between familiarity and innovation, offering a refined and immersive gaming experience that caters to both casual players and dedicated enthusiasts. Nintendo continues to prove its mastery in crafting consoles that captivate and entertain, making the Switch OLED a worthwhile investment for any gaming aficionado.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2023Size Name: 2.5 LitersStyle Name: ConcentrateVerified Purchase
As a homeowner with a patio, paths, and driveway that were suffering from an unsightly invasion of algae and lichens, I was in dire need of a solution. Patio Magic! Concentrate proved to be the answer I was looking for.The first thing that struck me was the ease of use. The concentrated formula means a little goes a long way. I mixed it with water as per the instructions and applied it to the affected areas using a simple garden sprayer. The application process was straightforward, and I appreciated that the packaging provided clear guidelines on dilution ratios and safety precautions.The results were nothing short of remarkable. After just a few days, I began to notice a significant difference. The algae and lichens on my patio, paths, and driveway started to fade and eventually disappear entirely. It's as if the surfaces underwent a magical transformation. The cleanliness and visual appeal of my outdoor areas were restored, making my home look significantly more inviting and well-maintained.What impressed me even more is that Patio Magic! not only removed the existing algae and lichens but also acted as a preventive measure. Even weeks after the initial application, my surfaces remained algae and lichen-free. It's like a protective shield for outdoor areas.Another noteworthy feature is the product's biodegradable nature. I appreciate that it's not harmful to plants or pets, so I could apply it with confidence, knowing that my garden and furry friends were safe.The 2.5-litre container provides ample product for multiple applications, which is great value for the price. Given the results I've seen, I consider it a wise investment in the maintenance and longevity of my outdoor spaces.In conclusion, Patio Magic! 16491 Concentrate is a game-changer for anyone dealing with algae and lichen problems on patios, paths, and driveways. It's easy to use, highly effective, and provides long-lasting results. I couldn't be happier with the transformation it brought to my outdoor areas, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable solution to revitalize and protect their outdoor spaces. This product lives up to its name, truly delivering ""magic"" for your patio and more.

It works
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 April 2024Size Name: 2.5 LitersStyle Name: ConcentrateVerified Purchase
I am writing this 11 months after the purchase so can honestly say it works.I applied it after I had jet washed the patio and allowed it to dry. I had been left with some algae black spots that would not shift. It was easy to apply using a pump sprayer. Because the patio was now relatively clean we didn’t see instant results but over the coming weeks/months, all of the algae has gone and has not returned this year. Will apply again this spring just to keep the algae and mould at bay. Would highly recommend.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2023Size Name: 5 LitersStyle Name: SprayerVerified Purchase
Very easy to use product with great results but you have to be patient and trust the product. We had quite a mouldy patio as we are NW facing and don’t get much sun in the winter.Applied this product in spring and amazed by the results a month later. Don’t expect immediate results however. This is one of those products that one day you will suddenly realise it has worked.Easy to set up the sprayer although it does seem to drain the batteries so I have bought my own sprayer and put it in that. Price is high but it’s definitely worth the price tag and a little goes a long wayCan’t recommend this enough. I will update next spring to see if it has prevented mould returning

There is a reason this is well liked internationally. If you want a simple pure whiskey with a pleasant taste that is not rotgut and under £20 this is it.I like it straight to sip but it is great for coffee, Irish cream, coffee cocktails and whisky mac. It is too light to add ice so don't  - use a cold stone or just pop it in the freezer first f you want it cool. Makes a good gift to bring to a party and usually will not last the night.

The new midnight blue colour is particularly susceptible to this issue. It is also extremely easy to scratch and doing so will reveal the silver metalic colour of the metal. This means you feel that you need to be very delicate using the laptop compared to others which are more rugged.- Apple's OS will take some getting used to if you are a windows user.

Fastest, convenient and long-lasting battery. Very few downsides.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 March 2023Size Name: 256GBColour Name: SilverVerified Purchase
I had the chance to buy and use the new MacBook Air M2  and I have to tell that I'm quite satisfied with this product. Overall, if you're looking for a strong, portable laptop that can handle everything from everyday basic tasks to heavier workloads, I'd strongly recommend this laptop.The M2 chip is, first and foremost, a game-changer. I've seen a visible jump in performance compared to my old M1 laptop, and it's really quick and responsive. The M2 handles everything with ease, whether I'm using many apps at once, editing photographs or videos, or browsing the web. The M2 version still has a very long-lasting battery which is a huge plus for me as someone who is constantly on the go.In terms of design, the MacBook Air is sleek and stylish, with a thin and lightweight build that makes it easy to take with me wherever I go. The screen is also stunning, with the new vivid colors and sharp details that make it a pleasure to use for work or entertainment. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the touchpad is smooth and responsive, making the whole system efficient and comfortable to use.For a student like me, the price can be a great motivator to buy a tool such as a laptop, this laptop has an above-average price tag which can change the majority of people's minds. However, I know what apple offers with their products, so if you have an extra buck to spend I'd say it'll be worth every penny as this is a high-quality product that'll last you a while.Overall, I am extremely impressed with the MacBook Air M2. It's a powerful and reliable machine that can handle everything from basic tasks to more demanding workloads. The design is sleek and stylish, and the screen is stunning. While the price could be a major factor for most people, this would be one of your best investments if you want a powerful yet portable laptop.

One of my favorite all-time laptops and a pleasure to use.  The keyboard is my all-time favorite: light touch, sensitive and responsive with absolutely no noticeable lag.  The screen which is amazing; sharp, bright and does not cause any eye strain, while the battery lasts quite long.Upgraded from an Intel based Macbook Pro with 16Gb RAM and the only feature I miss is the touch bar.  So far I haven't experienced any noticeable performance degradation even though this has only 8Gb RAM compared to my other macbook however I do recommend the 16GB variant rather than the 8Gb for 'future-proof' because the memory is unified (cannot be upgraded).Amazing laptop!

Mario's Back!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 October 2017Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase
If like myself you're of the generation who played Super Mario 64 upon its release, and were dazzled by the concept of a 3D environment that invited exploration, then you'll no doubt have had trouble accepting where the series has headed. This isn't to say that previous entries have been bad, but the 'wow' factor had somewhat been dampened by safe formulas.Enter Super Mario Odyssey, and boy oh boy was it worth the wait. You can tick off all the features that we've been clamouring for and more besides. Exploration? It underpins your progress entirely, with little to guide you other than your curiosity. Memorable soundtrack? It's one of the best the franchise has offered, featuring a huge range of instruments and styles. Customisation? Mario can purchase a wardrobe that will instantly put a smile on your face, ranging from snorkels to caveman outfits. And new boss battles? The creativity and characterisation finally makes them feel less like a chore, and more entertaining.Nintendo always deliver on gameplay, so it's unsurprising that the controls feel tight and instantly familiar. While Cappy may steal the show, classic moves make a return - the triple jump, long jump, back-jump and more - and it's just as comfortable to play in any controller configuration. Combined with the HD Rumble and sound effects, you get a wonderful sense of each environment that you wander, and you can't help but attempt different moves even when there is no reason to.You're also in control of what kingdom you travel to (The 'Odyssey' happens to be Mario and Cappy's airship), and how you spend your currencies. Regular gold coins can be exchanged in any kingdom, but purple coins are unique to the kingdom that you find them. Souvenirs and clothing will quickly fill the Odyssey! And if you get stuck for tips or new ideas, then you can view the travel guide and map for each kingdom. Presented just like a real tourist map, you can read it and view photos.But if there's one thing this game does better than any in the franchise's past, it's the storytelling. Peach may have been kidnapped again, but the narrative does an excellent job of helping you to root for Mario and his companions, with a clear arch and cut-scenes that play out at the right moments. The result is a much more cinematic entry than before, which adds plenty of drama instead of only cheap laughs. Case in point; the opening titles don't appear until around 20-minutes into the game, and you'll be in for some twists during the second and third act.Odyssey may well be a landmark game for Nintendo. Zelda: Breath of the Wild was always going to be a contender - and certainly one for Game of the Year - but whereas that game re-wrote the rule book for Zelda, I believe the Mario franchise was in greater need of a title like Odyssey. It's appeal stretches to just about anyone who can play a video game, and the quality in execution is flawless. Get it!

The Reason To Buy A Switch, Near Perfection, Simply Astonishing.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2017Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase
Super Mario Odyssey is easily one of the best Mario games ever made and the fact that it exists is acknowledgement by Nintendo that it can evolve with the ever changing Computer Game landscape. This game doesn't waste any time with lengthy exposition, in the opening moments gaming's most famous plumber is battling a monstrous Top Hat wearing white besuited Bowser atop of a floating Airship as the roaring King Koopa attempts to kidnap Princess Peach, force her into marriage and claim the Mushroom Kingdom for himself.Unfortunately Mario is bested in the opening exchange and his iconic Cap is shredded to pieces by the airships propellers, luckily enough though Mario is joined by a ghostly hat, Cappy, who is the driving force for this title. Cappy can be thrown at enemies as an attack but Odysseys gimmick is that you can inhabit a range of Classic and New Mario enemies throughout the world. In the opening moments of meeting Cappy he is hurled upon a Frog so that you can jump to a higher ledge and I never thought that a Frog wearing a Red Cap and sporting a voluptuous thick black moustache would make me smile, but It did.Nintendo has evolved Mario into an Open World experience which extends far beyond simple Platforming and Action and Adventure, this game works so well because it isn't afraid to take risks, we never thought we would see a Mario Game like this, the plumbers 30 year heritage is honoured and celebrated, it has the openness of Mario 64 and the creativity of Super Mario Galaxy, whether your inhabiting the caterpillar-esque Wigglers, stretching and retracting with a delightful accordion wheeze or the fluent movement of the Cheep-Cheep's swishing underwater each transformation is treated with the utmost of care and consideration and nothing feels superfluous, every aspect feels fantastic.For Me personally everything about Odyssey, from Mario's tiny facial expressions to the up tempo infectious music throughout the game everything feels meticulously crafted and presented, the painstaking amount of detail in this game is remarkable and appreciated. The visual variety and diverse worlds are as good if not better than anything that come before, you travel between worlds on your Airship named the ""Odyssey"" which you must power up with ""Moons"", the eye-popping colours of Tostarena Town back dropped against flame coloured red dunes of the sand kingdom is one of the more fantastical worlds set against worlds rooted in realism like the frantic streets of New Donk City.The amount of Moons needed to progress is minimal, Nintendo keep the main quest of Odyssey relatively brisk giving you the option to fervently search the kingdom your in or explore somewhere new. Having already arrived at Bowsers Kingdom I was a little disappointed as there could be an argument that the main quest is a little on the short side but I imagine after the credits roll there will be plenty of Moons and extra content left to hoover up. The variety, creativeness and imagination in each world is bewildering and this game will be the standard to which others are measured for a long time to come, masterpiece.

Streaming is excellent, response from the device is sharp and responsive and picture crisp on my 48"" screen.  Voice recognition is accurate and apps available are more than adequate for my use (not had a 'should have bought X' moment).  Price is right.All round winner.

I've had streaming boxes ie Shields and random unknown but recommended devices over the years, but having bought an expensive TV that did it all they all became redundant.But, my not even 2 year old TV now is suffering the typical fate of manufacturers selling it and forgetting it - ie apps have become buggy and unfixed or missing all together, and generally bloated performance wise.After a recent failing of YouTube on my TV I decided enough was enough, I'm going to try out the new Amazon Fire 4K Max sticks.Price - I mean it wasn't hugely cheap, but it's certainly not expensive in the grand scheme of media streamers and its certainly fully functional & if Amazon supports it like they do my very old fire tv stick on my bedroom TV which still performs brilliantly then it's worth every penny.Hardware wise, the specifications themselves are strong but the hardware included in the box is all you'll ever need, I'm not sure why there's some negative reviews about the remote quality as I personally feel its no worse than a normal TV remote, maybe some slightly rougher edges that will soon round off in use, it gets its weight from the batteries & it feels just fine.Setup - as someone who's dealt with complicated setups of streaming devices for years, the setup on the fire stick is down right boring - just pay attention to what it says on screen and you'll be left with a paired remote that also controls your basic functions.Performance wise, wow.. this things faster than my Samsung QN95 TV UI, and Xbox Series X for comparison, and it loaded up my Plex server on the first-run, in a matter of a couple of seconds, no stutter no bother.All the main apps are avaliable on the store, Netflix, Disney, iPlayer, YouTube, Prime Video, ITVX, 4, 5, Luna, and more.Plus if your tech savvy you can side load additional applications with relative ease.The UI, is the typical Fire TV UI nothing has changed there, splash banner at the top of the home screen advertising Amazon Video content (hardly a surprise) then your list of apps, easy.Functionality wise, there's enough settings in the settings menu to scale the screen properly to your TV if required, and sync up the sound if that's an issue, HDR / Sound modes etc basic simple but enough there to fine tune to one's specific setup should it be required.4K / HDR content plays with no issues at all from my Plex server, as does YouTube 4K etc.The Ambient mode, exclusive to the Max model I believe is a nice touch, basically a screen saver but more akin to an Echo Shows screen in that it displays the time, weather, reminders, etc after 5 minutes of being idle (or whatever time you set) - very quick to disappear and resume what you were doing, no slow down or stutter, just very ""Nice"".The only gripe I'd have would be the fire stick itself still has a Micro USB port, I mean come on Amazon/Jeff, its 2023 and even the fruity crew are rocking USB-C now.Technical tip: I'd advise using the supplied power plug, or if you do decide to run it directly from a USB port from the TV if you see a power insufficient warning, just use the plug - the device won't perform as it should and it will be unstable, possibly crash etc, while USB ports are rated for 5v (note the device wants 5.25v) it seldom actually manages a constant 5v.So, a great purchase for old dumb/redundant TVs (as long as they have an HDMI slot) to breath new life into them, but also nice even for modern/ year old hideously expensive TVs that get neglected by there manufacturers or the UI just isn't as slick as you'd expect it to be.All in all, very happy with my purchase & will recommend to others.

Fast, responsive and user friendly.....apart from a slight niggle and that's the remote.  How can I put it....when using it, it squeaks,creaks and feels cheap when pressing the buttons. I  hope I'm wrong but I'm wandering if it's going to last. Has anyone else noticed this issue  ?

The best Fire TV stick to date !
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 March 2024Style Name: Fire TV Stick 4K MaxVerified Purchase
I have purchased Fire TV sticks since they first came out, and each version offer something new and/or better.I have  2 TV's, one is 4K and the other is an older 1080p, but as you no doubt know, the apps supplied by the TV manufacturer can, and do change, which generally means you end up with half the original apps (if you are lucky) after 5 years, and why replace a perfectly good TV, when all you need to do is buy a Amazon TV stick, not only a lot cheaper but you will get all the very latest apps at the same time.These sticks are so easy to set up, as they 'talk you through' the process.The remotes also improves with each version, and I would advice that you purchase a 3rd party silicone cover to protect it, and they come is a massive range of colours for you to choose from.The remote requires 2 x AAA batteries which are included.I did however find that the ""Alexa Voice Remote Pro"", that is compatible with this TV stick is better than the supplied one, and as I had already bought it for use with a previous stick, it was a 'no brainer' not to use it.There are a lot of new features on this device for example Wi-Fi 6e support... if you have a router that supports that. It also supports Dolby Vision (12-Bit HDR+) and Dolby Atmos, but once again you need a TV that support those standards for picture and sound, but there again it will make the TV Stick future proof when you do come to upgrade your TV.Not to forget the processor (now Quad-core 2.0 GHz) and memory (now 16GB) get an upgrade too, all making things run smoother.I am impressed with every 'upgrade' that comes along and I personally think these are good value for money.5 stars all day long from me.

I saw these on Amazon for a great price for 24 cans but just my luck 7 cans where bashed one was burst & the other cans have sure signs of a box that’s been bashed around! That’s the chance I suppose I took ordering online. I will just need to drink then all quicker than I planned. 4 stars due to bashed cans as I like to drink out the can rather than a glass & 7 cans I’ve received are undrinkable from the can.

Cherry-Infused Delight: A Fizzy Experience Beyond the Ordinary
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 September 2023Colour Name: CherrySize Name: 330 ml (Pack of 24)Verified Purchase
When the craving for a revitalizing soft drink kicks in, I often reach for one brand in particular: Pepsi. But not just any Pepsi, the Pepsi Max Cherry in the 330ml can. This pack of 24 has been a consistent presence in my home, and for good reason.From the outset, the branding is unmistakable, with Pepsi’s iconic wave prominently displayed on each can. The design has a modern appeal, beckoning one to pop open the tab and take a refreshing sip. The cherry flavour, distinct yet not overpowering, provides a delightful twist to the classic Pepsi taste. The fusion of effervescence and that cherry undertone makes every sip an exhilarating experience.Key Positives: • Flavour Profile: The cherry variant is an interesting twist. It’s subtle, not overwhelmingly saccharine, and balances well with the effervescence of the soda. Pepsi has managed to keep the flavour authentic without veering into the artificial territory. • Calorific Value: Remarkably, each 330ml can contains just 1 kcal. For a fizzy drink, this is certainly an accomplishment. Enjoying a can doesn’t lead to the typical calorie-laden guilt that often accompanies indulgent drinks. • No Added Sugar: With the rising concerns over sugar-laden beverages and the health implications that come with them, Pepsi Max Cherry stands out. It contains zero sugar and zero carbs, making it an attractive choice for those monitoring their sugar intake. • Vegan and Vegetarian-friendly: In a world growing more conscious of dietary choices and preferences, it’s commendable that Pepsi Max Cherry caters to both vegans and vegetarians. • Recyclable Packaging: In today’s age of environmental awareness, it’s heartening to see that the cans and bottles are recyclable. Each can is not just a source of refreshment but also embodies Pepsi’s commitment to sustainable practices. • Sophisticated Ingredients: The inclusion of Carbonated Water, Colour (Caramel E150d), Sweeteners (Aspartame, Acesulfame K), and Flavourings (including Caffeine) offers a well-balanced and tantalizing drink without the need for excessive artificial ingredients.Delving into its ingredients, one immediately notices the absence of excessive chemicals. While it does contain aspartame, a commonly used sweetener, Pepsi has been transparent about its inclusion. The drink also contains caffeine, which, in moderation, provides that slight energy boost often needed in the mid-afternoon.The storage instructions are straightforward, suggesting the cans be kept in a dry and dark place. This is standard for most beverages, ensuring the product retains its flavour and fizz for an extended period.The safety warning is also worth noting. Like all fizzy drinks, the Pepsi Max Cherry comes in pressurised cans, and the reminder to handle them with care is prudent. Additionally, the drink contains a source of phenylalanine, an essential amino acid. This might be pertinent information for those who need to be aware of their phenylalanine intake.What truly adds a feather to its cap is its origin. Manufactured by Britvic Soft Drinks Ltd., a company with a reputable lineage in the beverage industry, it is a testament to the quality and standards maintained. The fact that it hails from the United Kingdom, a nation known for its stringent quality control measures, further instils confidence in the product.To sum it up, the Pepsi Max Cherry, 330ml Can, Pack of 24 has been a delightful addition to my beverage repertoire. Its invigorating taste, coupled with its conscious ingredient choices, makes it a drink I’d readily recommend to friends, family, and anyone in between. Whether you’re hosting a large gathering or simply enjoying a quiet evening, this drink, served chilled, is sure to elevate the experience.

Always been a fan of monopoly, someone who loves a family board game, interested in business and the money aspect. Bought this original version to progress my 6yr old from Monoploy Junior to this 8+ version. With a little help/teaching this version is perfectly fine for him as he grasped the basic concept from 4yr old with the junior edition. Minus the cheating because he likes to be the banker, often find a few extra $500 notes in his personal stash!!!Great fun, the player markers are metal, board has torn at the seam already where it folds away, could probably be made with a tougher lamination really. Bought at a great fair price.

A Classic Game of Strategy and Finance
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 May 2023Verified Purchase
I've always cherished the Monopoly Hasbro Gaming Classic Game, picking it up a few times a year when friends gather around. It's one of those games everyone has played at least once in their life, and if they haven't, they absolutely should.Monopoly is more than just a game. It's a learning experience. It teaches you the ins and outs of managing money and properties, skills that also prove beneficial in real life. The beauty of Monopoly lies in the strategic decisions you have to make – whether to buy a property, invest in houses and hotels, or wait for a better opportunity.While it's a fantastic game overall, it has flaws. Games can sometimes drag on, testing the patience of even the most dedicated players. However, the thrill of the game usually makes up for it.The quality of the game components is excellent – the board, pieces, and cards are sturdy and well-made. They've survived many intense gaming sessions, which speaks volumes about their durability.In conclusion, Monopoly is a staple in the world of board games. A blend of strategy, chance, and financial savvy keeps players engaged and returning for more. If you have yet to experience it, you're missing out on a classic gaming experience.

Value and quality family game
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2021Verified Purchase
Love the original still have my Waddington’s games copy made in leeds from the year I was born 69’ but it’s far too valuable to play hence the new modern copy, we love a game around the table with all the family once a month, decent quality though not as good as the sixties version of course, I think there should be more money for the bank as we often run out as we play fines to the board and whoever lands on free parking wins the pot. Other than that I love the new pieces and it was quite a bargain to buy a real family game for 14 .99 much better than seeing the kids faces stuck in their phones all day every day

Amazing little product
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 October 2023Style Name: Pack of 4Verified Purchase
Alright, folks, let's dive into these shiny little coin things called AirTags.**Look & Feel:**So, they're tiny, round, and have that unmistakable Apple vibe. No jagged edges or weird designs—just simple and smooth. You can even get your initials or an emoji on it if you're feeling fancy.**Finding Stuff:**This is where the magic happens. Linked up with Apple’s Find My network, you can basically find anything you attach this thing to. Lose your keys in the sofa again? No problem. Your iPhone and that AirTag will team up like Sherlock and Watson to find it for you.**Battery Life:**Apple says they last about a year. I've not had mine that long, but so far, so good. And get this – you can replace the battery yourself. No need to sell a kidney for a new one.**Stalker Alert:**Now, there's been some buzz about unwanted tracking. But Apple's thought of that. If a mysterious AirTag is tailing you, your iPhone will give you a heads up. Still, always good to stay on your toes, right?**Pricey Little Thing:**No sugarcoating—it's Apple, so it's gonna cost you more than some of the other trackers out there. But for the peace of mind and the whole ""it just works"" experience, some might say it's worth it.**The Bottom Line:**Look, if you're all in on Apple, these little guys might be a lifesaver for you. They're sleek, they work like a dream, and yeah, they're a bit pricey. But if you're the type who's always on a treasure hunt for lost items, this could be your new best friend.

An excellent tracker
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 November 2022Style Name: Pack of 4Verified Purchase
AirTags offer everything you expect. A seamless and satisfying Apple set up to begin with, mating with the ‘Find My’ app on your iPhone to present you with a comprehensive and easy to use ‘Items’ screen within, showcasing your AirTags graphically on the map as well as when they were last seen. Bear in mind that these effectively use crowdsourced data to help find your item - the positive of which being that there is usually someone with an iPhone nearby which means they are almost always located quickly. The negative being that if no one has been near your item then you have info on where they were last located say, 3 hours ago, which doesn’t always reassure you of their current location.I purchased these specifically for a holiday and they reassured me that my luggage was on the flight after all the recent baggage chaos to plague UK airports this year (although one must have been quite far from my seat in the baggage hold) so it didn’t update very promptly, regularly or reliably). They also helped immeasurably with baggage reclaim. I didn’t have to stand at the front watching and waiting - instead I kept an eye on the app and it showed me when it my luggage was on the belt and when I should be ready to yank it off.Since then I’ve kept using the AirTags for normal activities ie wallet, backpack etc and they’ve not let me down at all.Sure, the price is steep. That’s AppleTax I suppose but with it brings a high quality, good looking item that I enjoy using.TL;DR If you’re looking for a reliable item tracker in almost all circumstances then go for the AirTags. 4 stars only due to the cost. I’d feel better if they were a bit cheaper.

Should you buy Apple AirTags?
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 September 2023Style Name: Pack of 4Verified Purchase
Apple AirTags are small, lightweight tracking devices that can be used to track lost items. They are compatible with all iPhones and iPads running iOS 14.5 or later. AirTags use a combination of Bluetooth, Ultra Wideband, and the Find My network to help you locate your lost items.To use an AirTag, simply attach it to the item you want to track and add it to the Find My app. Once an AirTag is added to the Find My app, you can view its location on a map. If an AirTag is out of Bluetooth range, you can still use the Find My network to track it down. The Find My network is a network of over a billion Apple devices that can help you locate your lost items, even if they are far away.Comparison with other trackers:AirTags are similar to other tracking devices, such as Tile trackers and Samsung SmartTags. However, AirTags have some advantages over other trackers. For example, AirTags use the Find My network, which is a much larger network than the networks used by other trackers. This means that AirTags are more likely to be able to track down your lost items, even if they are far away.AirTags also have some disadvantages compared to other trackers. For example, AirTags are more expensive than some other trackers. Additionally, AirTags do not have a built-in battery, so they will need to be replaced every year or so.Pros:-Easy to use-Compatible with all iPhones and iPads running iOS 14.5 or later-Uses the Find My network, which is a much larger network than the networks used by other trackers-Accurate location tracking-AffordableCons:-Does not have a built-in battery-Only works with Apple devices-More expensive than some other trackersReasons to buy:-If you are looking for a convenient way to track your belongings-If you have an Apple device-If you are prone to losing your belongings-If you need to track valuablesPotential reasons to avoid:-If you do not have an Apple device-If you do not want to spend a lot of money on tracking devicesConclusion:Overall, Apple AirTags are a great way to track your lost items. They are easy to use, accurate, and affordable. However, it is important to note that AirTags do not have a built-in battery and are more expensive than some other trackers.Additional notes:-AirTags are not waterproof, so they should not be used to track items that may get wet.-AirTags can be used to track a variety of items, including keys, wallets, bags, and even pets.-AirTags can be used to create custom notifications, such as receiving a notification when your keys leave your house or when your luggage arrives at the airport.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 March 2024Verified Purchase
A doddle to install, inconspicuous, and works relly well. I was a bit worried by data usage - although I have a short commute the hours add up over a month - but it uses hardly any. I used under 2gb of data during a month (5 days/week). A recent trip of over 2 hours used less than half a gig. I get in the car wait about 10 seconds for the ping and say Alexa play (whatever) and it just connects. Did have a couple of dropouts on the 2 hour journey but reconnected fairly quickly as it is reliant on your phone network.

All-new Echo Auto (2nd Gen): A Pocket-Sized Copilot with Room for Improvement
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2023Verified Purchase
The second-generation Echo Auto aims to bring the convenience of Alexa to any car, regardless of built-in tech. While it succeeds in adding voice control for music, calls, and smart home management, some hiccups hold it back from being a must-have upgrade.Pros:Compact and discreet: Gone are the bulky days of the first Echo Auto. This slim design easily tucks away on your dashboard, staying out of sight but within reach.Crystal-clear microphone array: Five mics ensure Alexa catches your voice over road noise, music, and even chatty passengers.Versatile connectivity: Connect via Bluetooth or an auxiliary cable, ensuring compatibility with most car setups.Phone fast charging: A built-in USB port keeps your phone juiced up while you drive.Familiar Alexa features: Enjoy all the usual perks of Alexa, from music streaming and podcast playback to calls, news updates, and smart home control.Cons:Reliance on phone data: Echo Auto doesn't have built-in data, so all Alexa functionalities depend on your phone's data plan.Android Auto and CarPlay integration issues: While compatible, the integration isn't always smooth, leading to occasional disconnects and hiccups.Limited audio control: You can't adjust volume or playback within the Echo Auto itself, requiring you to reach for your phone or car controls.Overall:The All-new Echo Auto is a decent, portable way to add hands-free Alexa control to your car. Its compact design, clear mics, and phone charging are definite pluses. However, the dependence on phone data, Android Auto/CarPlay quirks, and price tag might leave some users wanting more. If you're deeply invested in the Alexa ecosystem and value voice control on the road, the Echo Auto is worth considering. But for casual users or those with newer cars with built-in voice assistants, alternative solutions might be more appealing.Recommendation:If you're a die-hard Alexa fan and frequently drive without car-integrated voice assistants, the Echo Auto offers a convenient, portable solution. However, if you're on a budget, have limited data, or rarely use voice control in your car, consider alternative options before taking the plunge.I hope this review gives you a helpful perspective on the All-new Echo Auto (2nd Gen)!

Impressive bit of kit
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 April 2024Verified Purchase
The Alexa we have at home can be a bit annoying, however this has been a revelation. I saw it as an alternate hands free kit but being able to get DAB radio has been really good.Having the music library easily to hand is great. I have found it most effective if you select an artist you like, and while the indoor Alexa musical choice is a bit word it picks some absolute bangers! No idea why.Yes this is dependent on signal strength but even in the digital desert of Norfolk it doesn’t drop out much. Travelled from Yarmouth to Sheffield and back yesterday, and it didn’t drop out once. Phoned Mrs H on way back and that was decent too.Worth £59:99, no doubt.

I bought this because here have been times where I'd love an Echo in the car to dish out voice commands, the in-car speech recognition is pretty dire.Installation is REALLY easy. I use the Bluetooth connection.Alexa is alert even with fairly loud music playing. But the weakest link in the chain is the Cellular connection.The whole premise and operability of this Echo Auto depends on the quality of your mobile connection. So living in a hilly area (West Cumbria) means that my connection drops several times within a few miles nomatter which direction I go. I know its nothing which Amazon / Alexa have control over but when I was scoping out the product and reading/watching reviews this fact was scarcely mentioned.So for playing radio or another streaming source you have to have a permanent mobile data connection otherwise playback stops and you have to ask all over again. Tonight I tried the device and I had to drive 2 miles from the Kangol car park in Cleator Moor to get a signal for Alexa to even respond to my queries due to poor mobile coverage.Also navigation is pushed firmly as a good thing to do with this device but of course navigation starts on the phone - no good if you're driving and the phone is in your pocket or glovebox.The limiting factor of course is when using the Alexa Auto with Bluetooth the phone is only linked to the car as an audio device so you have to bear that in mind.I'm kinda in 2 minds about sending it back for a refund because of these points mentioned but I'll give it a few days and see.A true solution for integration I think is still years away and will require proper collaboration from car manufacturers. Currently it's a faff and awkward to use with limited usability.

A really high quality pair of heaphones with some great features
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2022Style Name: 1st Gen. MagSafe Charging CaseVerified Purchase
I really love these headphones for every day use. They're small and convenient to carry around, they're quick to pair and unpair, and have great in-ear detection to autopause your music when removed.The case is simple, with a USB C or wireless charging capacity, a battery and charging indicator LED, and a useful feature that shows the battery of the case and buds when it is opened near your phone.The buds have really simple but effective inputs that can be easily configured. The defaults are single press for pause, double for skip, triple for backwards, and hold to change between transparency and noise cancelling modes. The buttons are light to press, but provide a satifying affirmative clicking feel when pressed. I much prefer the physical squeeze required rather than the side taps that my old Galaxy Buds Live had, this is because it is impossible to accidentally tap or tap too many times due to poor tap detection.The buds sport three unique modes for listening, alongside just plain output.-Active Noise Cancelling. This does a great job at blocking out background noise, and combined with the silicone ear tips allows a great fit, for passive noise cancelling.-Transparency Mode. This mode passes in noise from the outside, allowing better listening for traffic, conversations with the buds still in, and just listening to the outside world with music at the same time. I honestly can't believe how good this mode is at letting through everything at a sensible level, I can hear my footsteps as I walk, and the birds in the trees, but I can also hear traffic, all at the same time as my music. It is so well balanced, so I finally understand how Airpod users are having a conversation and forget they still have them in.-Spatial Audio. This mode makes it so that the audio is played through the buds corresponding to the direction you're facing from your device. This means that if your left bud is faced away from the device it will be quieter than the right bud faced towards the device. This mode is a cool gimmick that I suppose may be useful to get a more immersive film viewing experience.Overall the product is high quality, with great features.

Used them everyday since purchase
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2024Style Name: 1st Gen. MagSafe Charging CaseVerified Purchase
Just a really solid set of headphones. Noise cancelling basically changed my life - maybe an ADHD thing - who knew quiet was so nice?!Use them everyday, battery is great, charging case is brilliant. Being able to find them using the “Find My..” app is great.I was surprised at how good the noise cancelling is and I take delight at occasionally turning it off and wondering how I did anything effectively in life before I had the ability to enter my own little distraction free force field.As expected my ANC over ear Beats probably have a more effective noise cancellation but they serve a different purpose. The AirPods Pro as discrete, sound good and block out unwanted stuff. Perfect!

Amazing, and suprisingly, well worth the money.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2022Style Name: 1st Gen. MagSafe Charging CaseVerified Purchase
I took a massive risk with buying £185 earphones, this is way more than i'd typically like to spend.But i'd be damned, they're really, really good.The noise cancellation is fantastic, and really useful if you're a frequent user of public transport where things can get quite loud, once turned on all I can hear is my music.But by far the most impressive feature is the transparency mode. The ability to hear as if nothing was in your ears whatsoever is amazing, alongside features like conversation boost, which boosts the volume of the person you are currently facing, makes transparency mode a feature I never expected to be so good.Furthermore, audio quality is FANTASTIC absolutely no complaints from me there.It's worth noting that the Airpods Pro come with 3 ear-tips and none of which really fit me very well ( there's an option in settings for testing the fit) but I just stuck on the smallest tips and pushed them into my ears (obviously not being violent with it), and over a couple weeks or so of fairly-frequent use they just became more of a natural fit, and are much more comfortable now.So if at first, none of the eartips fit you, try a couple weeks just trying to make it work.

Undisputed best convenience
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 May 2022Style Name: 1st Gen. MagSafe Charging CaseVerified Purchase
Bought these to replace a first gen pair, which already had a round of replacements (one due to battery, other knocked out from my ear while leaving a crowded train). The battery was again busted in both, getting a replacement unfortunately would cost almost what Amazon is asking for the Pro's for, so went for it.The good:- fantastic convenience - for me, if you get a good fit, these are the definitive sports earbuds, they ""just work"" as much the first gen- sound quality is quite good - there is a critics bandwagon bashing these in terms of audio quality; I'm no audiophile, but I'm picky enough to tell the difference between a CD and lossy formats, and have to say I quite enjoy the sound and specially the bass on these ones, and also find the spatial audio and dolby atmos interesting; your mileage may vary, the quality of the seal you get hugely influences the sound on all headphones and specially earbuds, getting that wrong messes up the whole sound signature; regarding the treble, there is a trick someone found of going to Accessibility > Audio/Visual > Headphone Accommodations, then turn that on and select ""Balanced Tone"", that for me significantly improved the treble, kind of looks to me that Apple deliberately favours smoothing potentially harsh sounds over fidelity.The less good:- ANC is ok, miles away of the seal you get from let's say Sony WM-1000XM series over-ear headphones, I don't own Sony or Bose's earbuds to compare; I think is the most ANC people would want to safely walk around (probably better to turn it off altogether near traffic), but somewhat lacking for your typical open space office- larger case when compared with the first gen- more functions mean they are more complicated to use for less tech savvy people- more tightly coupled with AppleOver all, hands down recommendation if you have an iPhone, would be great if Apple supported these better on other platforms.

Affordable HD streaming stick
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 February 2024Verified Purchase
I am not even going to lie; I no longer have a cable connection to my TV – because “what’s the point?” I mean, think about it: we can access all the cable channels on stream, BBC, Channel 4, ITV, etc. and whatever you cannot find on cable… you can find through streaming Netflix, Disney, Amazon Prime… So, in a world where streaming content has become the norm, the Amazon Fire Stick emerges as a tiny yet mighty device that has revolutionised the world for those who have not yet been able to buy a Smart TV. Let’s have a look at why this Firestick is my go-to.The Perfect Size First things first, let’s talk about the Fire Stick’s size. It’s small. Really small. It’s about the size of a normal USB drive (fractionally bigger), which makes it incredibly portable. You can easily take it if you are jumping in between homes or when you go on holiday to ensure you never have to stop streaming. No more cable channels in languages you promised yourself you’d learnt but never got around to.Setup, Fuss-Free? Setting up the Fire Stick should be a breeze. All you need is an HDMI port and a Wi-Fi connection, and you’re good to go. Plug it into your TV, follow the on-screen instructions, and you’ll be scrolling through your favourite streaming apps in minutes. But when has anything been that simple? All I know is that technology can be super temperamental and that it took me over 2hrs to get through it. I wouldn’t say I am tech-savvy, but I do know how to follow instructions… or so I thought! The pain was worth it, though – try it out, and please do let me know where I went wrong! Another thing about the setup I don’t necessarily like is the fact that it needs to be plugged in – a part of me wishes it could be battery-powered, but I know that comes with its own headaches, so I am unsure whether it is something I dislike or something I find mildly annoying.Alexa, play despacito! One of the most popular features is Alexa. You can activate this voice assistance by following the on-screen instructions. And then… just press the microphone button on the remote and ask Alexa to find your favourite show, play some music, or even order pizza. It’s like having your own personal assistant right there on your couch. Plus, it should understand natural language, so for all of those with strong accents, you are in luck! I personally don’t have it on, but I do have an Alexa Dot, so… I am kind of covered anyway. Alexa lives “almost” rent-free at my house!Endless Streaming Options I can’t say I have needed an app that this Firestick hasn’t got. It supports all the major streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and, of course, Amazon Prime Video. With thousands of apps available, you’re sure to find whatever app you need.Smooth Performance Don’t let its size fool you; the Fire Stick packs a punch when it comes to Performance. Like anything, a lot of it will depend on your internet connection, but from what I have experienced, it delivers smooth, lag-free streaming, even in high-definition or 4K. The adverts for it will tell you that it is thanks to its quad-core processor, but I do take it to faith.Semi-customisable Experience Personalisation is key, and the Fire Stick kind of understands that. So a big thumbs up is that you can arrange your favourite apps on the home screen, also offering recommendations based on your viewing history – BUT – it does not allow you to have two Amazon accounts at once. Let me explain that: my partner pays for Amazon Prime – I don’t; I pay for Amazon music, my partner doesn’t. So if I have access to Amazon music, I need to be in my account, but if I want to stream through Amazon Prime, I have to log out of my Amazon account and re-customise everything on my partner’s account – a bit of a pain BUT not a major issue.Price Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of the Fire Stick, at least for me, is its price. It won’t break the bank, and it really helped me when all I could do was afford a £40 TV (which was a gift, by the way; talk about being broke!)So… would I recommend you to buy the Amazon Fire Stick? Absolutely yes. It is a small and mighty device that allows me to stream and watch everything I want without having to be glued to my laptop and/or phone. So join me, and let me know how it goes!

So, let's cut the cord, shall we? The Amazon Fire Stick is here to save the day, transforming your TV into a streaming paradise without the cable clutter. And guess what? I'm here to spill the beans on why this tiny gadget is the real MVP of home entertainment.First off, picture this: your ancient TV, once gathering dust in the corner, is now the star of the show thanks to the Fire Stick. Just plug it into the HDMI port, and voila! Instant upgrade. And hey, I took it a step further and paired it with a projector – talk about movie night goals right in the comfort of my own living room.Now, let's talk setup. Some folks out there might've had a bit of a tech tango getting things rolling, but not me. Smooth sailing from start to finish. No fuss – just pure streaming bliss.Oh, and Alexa? She's like your personal genie, granting your streaming wishes with a simple voice command. I hardly use Alexa, but it’s nice knowing you have your own virtual assistant at hand.And the streaming options? Endless. Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video – you name it, the Fire Stick's got it. And let's not forget Prime Video's sweet deal on the latest blockbusters – movie night just got a whole lot better.Performance-wise, this little stick packs a punch. Smooth streaming, even in glorious HD or 4K. It's like having your own private cinema right at home, minus the sticky floors and overpriced popcorn.And the best part? It won't break the bank. Affordable brilliance, my friends. So if you're ready to bid farewell to cable chaos and hello to streaming paradise, the Amazon Fire Stick is your ticket to entertainment nirvana.In conclusion? Two thumbs up, five stars, ten out of ten – however you wanna rate it, this little gadget is a game-changer.

Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite with Alexa Voice Remote Lite
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2024Verified Purchase
This is the cheapest Fire Stick you can get from Amazon & well, it's brilliant. I have an older telly which decided I could no longer use my ITV, BBC, Channel 4 apps etc. So thinking I may need to replace this TV, I made the desicion to try this Fire Stick first. Well to say it feels like I have a new TV would be an understatement, the TV now has a new life, an entertainment hub.Install batteries into your remote to enable control over the stick. Then install the stick into the rear of your TV set using the provided cables etc. Once connected to your WIFI & signing into your Amazon account, wait for few updates & hey presto your up and running, easy. Alexa let's get going!!As most of you know having Amazon Prime you get so much content to view and options are endless. I am really happy though because I can again enjoy BBC, ITV etc catch up as they are included.You may have noticed that I only gave 4 stars overall for this item, even though I really love it. This is simply down to the fact the remote has know volume control on it, and so I have to mooch about for the TV remote to carry out this action, very annoying. I know this is the lite version of Fire Stick, but a volume adjuster would have been nice. Even so I Highly Recommend this item.

We wanted a broader range of tv, all the streaming apps, catch up, music, there is so much on this new stick, I have an older one at home but will replace it on our main TV and use the older one on the kitchen tv which is also good.  It improves the picture quality on your tv, and provides excellent entertainment. The remote is very good and easy to use, there is a turn off button, which I haven’t got on my original stick, which gives peace of mind when we leave the caravan. Sound quality is very good and a wide range of music is available. Good price in the Easter deals.

Firestick is a game changer - we don't use live tv anymore
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2024Style Name: with Alexa Voice Remote ProVerified Purchase
We got this firestick to replace our old one (gone 13 years), it wasn't broken but was just getting slow. It speaks to the longevity of these fire sticks. This one is very speedy and fast, and has many applications to add on; BBC, ITV, Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Paramount - basically anything you can think of it has! So we don't need to pay for our live TV anymore as this firestick has it all covered. Our favorite feature is that it links to your amazon account so any amazon devices you have (ring doorbell, alexa etc), it connects to. We use it to answer our door sometimes as it connects to the ring doorbell if you say ""Alexa, show me 'the front door' (Or whatever you named your ring device)"" - you don't need to download any app to see the doorbell. We have also installed Nordvpn on our firestick, another great addition as it allows us to browse the internet safely - I'm so glad that theres the option to have this. The quality is very good on the screen, the interface is very nice and easy to access - if you ever get lost then the remotes have a fabulous feature where you can press and hold the blue button to talk and request what you want - this is so much faster for us than doing it ourself!! We love this firestick and it has changed our world. So glad we made the upgrade. It's such a bargain for the price.

""Wow""doesn't do it justice! Been avaid gamer since the 1980s and had the Atari and everything that came after it. Love my gaming.Unboxing and setting up was easy. The anticipation was high as i had never even had a VR headset on of any kind, plugged it and switched on. If you are in two minds about buying this like I was and you like your games then please DO NOT hesitate, it literally blew my mind and I have seen it all in gaming.  This is next level , no it's 10 levels above any kind of gaming now. I have seen the future and it's amazing. I played for one hour as it was late but I can't stop thinking about it. My expectations were high but this was so far beyond anything I could have imagined. I was expecting crappy graphics but it was more like ready player one! At one point I was opening a van door leaning out looking behind the can shooting an Uzi 9mm down a London street. I couldn't quite comprehend the thrill. 2D Is dead, things will never be the same again.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2018Platform For Display: Starter PackEdition: No additional itemsVerified Purchase
Absolutely blown away this thing is insane so much better than I thought. You'll need move controllers for most games though. Gran Turismo is incredible thee best experience in a driving game ever. Fact. I can't wait for more the playroom games are amazing too it's funny showing friends what we see as they are playing in VR after. Watching the TV like ""you was in there"" ☺️ im looking forward to seeing what new games come out.. Battlefield VR would be incredible and more FPS games too longer games as well More Gran Turismo and similar games F1 VR even GTA VR would be insane oh and a better real to life boxing game... Hint hint nudge nudge sony techs 😉 just an update I'd recommend sitting down playing most games preferably on a chair that doesn't swivel as you end up facing the wrong way, I've strapped mine so minimal movement, I've also fitted hooks with elasticated straps to my ceiling to hold the headset cable out of the way to protect its connectors, Ive found it best having the camera underneath my TV as my TV is on the wall my cam is about waist height. You will also need about 2x2m clear playing area, slightly less when seated but still 2m away from TV 😊

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2017Verified Purchase
After seeing this for sale on Black Friday I thought I'd treat myself. If you're reading this review it means you're thinking of getting one. Stop reading and buy it now. It's absolutely amazing. Easy to set up, and after a few tweaks of the settings I was roaring round the Nurbergring in no time. Lap after lap with a huge grin on my face. I even ended up feeling a bit sick because of motion sickness! Tried the PS4 Worlds too. It's so goofy you can't help but love it. I played a movie on my Amazon Prime (Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers) and it was just like being in the cinema. I used my own Sony Noise Cancelling headphones to properly immerse myself. The supplied earphones are a bit pants.There are a lot of folk saying that their starter pack didn't come with a camera, mine did.This really is brilliant. And now my missus can watch any garbage TV she wants to while I watch movies, sport (Now TV) or play games. Worth £250 for that alone...

Amazing experience, can't wait for more games.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2017Verified Purchase
Firstly let's talk about the contents of the pack. It contains the VR headset & processer unit (and all the cables etc), VR Worlds game AND the PS Camera. Yes, the camera IS included!!!! No idea why so many people are saying it is not included, it's the starter pack! Probably worth noting this bundle included version 1 of the headset.I managed to get the starter pack and Skyrim VR for £249.99 so I'm counting myself pretty lucky, and given the lack of VR games out there (as in full scale games such as Skyrim) at the moment I'm not sure if have paid much more for it.It's not too difficult to set up, but it does add a whole new bunch of cables into the mix so make sure you've got some space (a hdmi from PS4 into the processer unit, a usb from PS4 to processer, power supply for the processer and the cables from unit to the VR headset).The experience is amazing, it is so immersive, especially with the surround sound headphones. The quality is obviously not as good as a 4K TV but it's still pretty good. The overall experience is brilliant. The headset take a bit of fiddling to get it comfy and fitting nicely but once it on then it's all good.VR Worlds - this is not a full scale game, it's almost like a series of concept games to show what is possible. They are fun but don't expect days worth of gaming time out of them. They give you an idea of things that could be done and are pretty entertaining but act as teasers for the future (and the future is looking crazy).Skyrim VR - Amazon have lost my parcel so I can't comment yet, but I will come back after it gets posted out again and I get a chance to play it. But my friend recently bought it and based on his comment ""it's amazing so far but I'll let you know more after I man up enough to fight the scary spiders"", I am highly looking forward to it.Non-VR games/films - Well, I like this part. While wearing the VR you can still see and navigate the home screen, menus, ps store etc etc, so you don't have to take it off to do other things. And, you can play any game or film through the VR headset, it's obviously not VR but it's like playing it on a giant cinema screen. If you turn your head the headphones react and play louder in the ear that's closer as if turning more towards the source of the sounds. I love this, the ability to play any game is just awesome, the feeling of being sat at home on a comfy sofa playing on what feels like a huge cinema screen is brilliant.I have felt a little motion sick while trying the VR Street Luge game, but I was hungover at the time so I don't think that's an accurate representation of it.The reason for 4 star is that whilst the VR is amazing and immersive, the quality is not quite there. Also the lack of games is a bit of shame, there are a couple out there but most VR games are what feels like indie/concept games. Given some time there will be some amazing games out - I mean come on they've managed to port Skyrim, a game released in 2011, into a full VR experience so surely new games cant be too far away!I'd definitely recommend this if you can get a good deal.

Excellent upgrade
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 February 2019Platform For Display: 1TB WhiteEdition: StandaloneVerified Purchase
I didn't think I was going to get much from an upgrade from a classic XBox One to this XBox One S. I was wrong.Firstly I had read lots of reviews saying that people were getting refurbished or opened boxes, or that the mains plug wasn't UK, or that the DVD region code was wrong. None of these were true in my case - brand new, original packaging and security, UK mains plug, correct DVD regionNow onto the performance.Your games don't run at a higher frame rate, or give you any form of gaming advantage over the original, however, the control interface is much more snappy. No waiting forever for the XBox to boot up - it gets to the point that you are playing your game about 20% fasterThe controller has a subtly textured grip, much better than the slippery originalI only have a full HD TV, so I can't comment about 4k upscaling on the DVD player, but the movies look just a little more defined in the shadows than the originalIt's smaller in itself, and there is no huge power brick that needs to be hidden anywhere. It also runs slightly coolerThere is no Kinect port, but I never used it anyway, and you can by a hugely expensive adapter if you want to continue with your existing deviceIt's got a proper on-off button, but I find that controlling on off by using  the controller seems more fluid and reliable, so I now use thatA lot of benefits that I wasn't expecting, and a worthy replacement for by broken XBox one original.

Bought as a belated gift
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2020Platform For Display: 1TB WhiteEdition: StandaloneVerified Purchase
This is initially easy to set up with a basic guide to help should you need it, one cable here, the other cable there; the time consuming stuff comes after you switch it on.  Updates - that took ages.  Registering - that took a while.  This came with a code to give you a months free membership, after which it is about £9 a month for the basic membership.  One of the reasons for buying this model is that I have a half dozen Xbox 360 games (Skyrim, Dead Island, etc.) that I love playing so the fact that the Amazon site claimed that old games could be played was appealing, except that each disc for each game was rejected along with a message that only SOME of the old games could be played on this new machine; so not happy there as I will have to buy them all over again!  You can download games if you are a member, however, I am an opportunistic gamer and do not play well with others so only play by myself and not online, so that part is no good for me.  Otherwise the graphics are good.  Oh and I this as a Christmas/early birthday present as I am 60!

This console barely looks as if it has Bill Gates's stamp on it - for all the gold in China complaining about how bad computer gaming is when that is all I have too (sometimes). Very good console - with one glitch that breaks the connection and needs me to re-sign in. So what. This consumer is right - Nintendo is next.

Reliable, simple and useful, though not great value at full price.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2024Style Name: Amazon Smart PlugVerified Purchase
I've got quite a few of these smart plugs from Amazon, bought over several years whenever they come up on a deal. Before trying the first one I had an old fashioned time clock to switch on a lamp each night, the timings for which had to be changed manually every month as the nights drew in or out. The first Amazon smart plug I bought was a revelation, being able to set up a routine to switch on a lamp at sunset, and switch it off again at 11pm, and also to switch on or off by voice commands. I've bought several more since, and have set up all my lamps and lights that cannot take smart bulbs use smart plugs for home automation. They are expensive at normal price, but catch them on a deal and they are fair value. Sure there are cheaper products out there but are completely integrated with Alexa and work seamlessly which is why I like them. Incredibly easy to setup, they have been reliable for me with just the odd drop out now and then that has always been resolved with the old ""switch off and back on"" trick. Unfortunately I haven't found any other practical use apart from lights, but I am planning to use one soon to switch on and off a hot water recirculation pump, both on a schedule (routine in Alexa app) and also by voice command. They are quite big compared to some rival products, but I still like them and will continue to buy them when they are reduced price.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2024Style Name: Amazon Smart PlugVerified Purchase
Purchased this over other plugs as I wanted something official from Amazon that supported Alexa.I needed this to help integrate my son's night light with Alexa and our routines. It does exactly what you need it to which was to turn on and off the light via Voice or Remotely.Can't fault its functionality. It comes pre-configured to your Amazon account so set up is a breeze and jsut worked.The only negative I would say is the overall size, compared to other plugs out there which are half the size. Hopefully Amazon decide to reduce the size and release a new version.A good feature to have would be at least one additional USB connection on the plug to charge other devices.

Oh my word, needn't have worried, absolutely the best item I have used on my legs to remove unwanted hair and make my legs feel lovely and smooth. I use mine in the shower. Make sure your legs are wet, pop the item against your leg applying a small amount of pressure and proceed to make circular movements on the wet skin and you will see the hair and dry skin just disappear. Once legs are dried apply cream liberally to your legs. Wonderful, am very pleased with my product, won't go back to waxing.

They’re good at hiding the spots however I don’t think they extract anything or help with extracting. I also feel like the spots need to breath to heal and covering them up with these don’t help. Took longer to heal when wearing these

Super fun with friends
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2019Verified Purchase
I bought what do you meme because I really enjoyed playing cards against humanity with friends last Christmas and thought that making up memes would be a nice fun twist on game play. I also liked the fact that the name of the game is a play on words to Justin Bieber’s song what do you mean. Just to be clear though this game is not suitable for children.The game is straight forward like cards against humanity but here each person takes 7 caption cards and then one player takes it turns to be the judge  and puts up an image with a supplied easel which could be for example a photo of a fat cat lying on it’s back. The caption card a player might have is, ’when your stepdad Rick drinks all your Mountain Dew’ or ‘When you’re trying to lose weight but gain 3 pound every time you walk by and smell the chippy’.  Everyone then secretly selects one card and hands it to the Judge, the Judge then reads out each caption after shuffling them, it’s best to keep the photo visible to all players to create more laughs and banter.  The judge then votes on which one they found the most funny and suitably matching. The judge then asks the players who’s card they chose and the winner of that round takes the photo card. The game also comes with freestyle cards and everyone has to come up with their own captions for that image on the spot. The game keeps going till you get hungry and order a pizza, not my words though, seriously that bit is in the rules!The game has plenty of caption cards to get through and there is a reasonable amount of photo cards too. It also comes with a separate lot of adult caption cards to discover.I played this with some friends aged between 21 - 32, we really had alot of fun and were laughing hysterically at each round of the game. Some of the photo cards were recognised by some of the players which was good - being meme fans.As this is the UK version they have done a good job with making the caption cards relevant and current to a UK audience for example one caption card says, ‘when your mate tells you they voted Leave’.Although there is plenty of caption cards I can imagine the re-playability of it will become less and less over time but there are expansion packs out there and I would of thought that the company will bring out more like we saw with Cards against humanity. Also the game does encourage you to use your own photos.The box it’s self is good quality and should last well but is not that compact.  When packing away though it was a little tricky as the photo cards prevent the box lid sliding all the way down, as they cannot be stored alongside the caption cards which I would of probably preferred, but I think this would be possible after taking out the plastic tray the caption cards sit in anyway. The quality of the caption cards are not bad and pretty thick. The photo cards are a good size too.  I have included some photos of the inside of the box, the box itself and the contents.The price I felt was maybe a little steep but I have found this has been varying a little on Amazon.So to conclude I would recommend this game to people that enjoyed cards against humanity, who are not easily offended and enjoy banter. I look forward to getting the game back out before next Christmas.

Fun enough, but the pictures weren't the best
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 February 2024Verified Purchase
Bought this for family ""fun"" over Christmas. Yes there is a NSFW warning, and some of the text on the cards is pretty out there on the pervy scale. We could live with that, but the real let down was in the pictures. Many were just stock photos as opposed to the classic memes you find on the internet. I understand that this is probably due to the minefield of copyright infringements, so maybe it's just impossible to really do the concept justice without printing your own...

if you have AM4 just get this
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2024Style Name: Processor OnlyVerified Purchase
If you are wondering wether to upgrade to AM5 or keep the AM4, I would highly recommend just upgrading the CPU to the 5800X3d or 5700X3d when that is out (feb 2024).I saw HUGE fps increases across numerous games such as CS2 and COD. 100fps increase on CS2, unbelievable performance and now feels very smooth playing. Previously would get stutters.It is simply not worth upgrading to AM5 if you have a compatible AM4 board, most games are GPU bound and will make very little difference. Might as well save up for AM6 and avoid the hassle of rebuilding the PC.Remember to upgrade your BIOS before attempting the upgrade and if using encryption without a TPM to suspend it whilst upgrading, or you will have to put the old CPU back in!I would recommend noctua HT-N1 with this CPU, easy to install with a small blob and applies evenly.Do not do the X pattern with most pastes like people suggest, it's too much paste and easy to mess it up.For £260 (at time of writing), this is good value for money for the HUGE performance increase in most games if on an older ryzen CPU. You may want to hold out for the 5700X3D that is due in feb 24, however the RRP is expected to be around £240-250 so not much saving and lower performance.

Great CPU - How to make the most of it
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 February 2024Style Name: Processor OnlyVerified Purchase
To begin, I had a good mid range AM4 gaming rig (4 year old) that I was debating upgrading e.g. new motherboard and system overhaul at significant cost, but after some internet research I realised that with a BIOS update my MSI MPG X570 Gaming Edge WIFI motherboard could be upgraded from my AMD 3700X to 5800X3D, with the benefit of a substantive boost to 1080p or 1440p gaming performance.Please note that I had recently updated my GPU from an NVIDIA MSI RTX 2070 TRI FROZR Super to AMD Powercolor Red Devil 7800XT, and whilst I did note the performance boost on the GPU swap, it felt something was missing, as if the system could perform better (Cyber punk at 1080p averaging 97fps for example on ultra settings). That lead to the above research and decision to replace my CPU with the 5800X3D.CPU replacement went to plan and system booted fine, but I noted increased fan noise and elevated CPU temps. By design it would seem that AMD states the 5800X3D is fine to run at 85-100 degrees C....sorry but that doesn't float with me, safe yes, but noisy and power hungry. After a little research, I discovered if you have an MSI motherboard that supports AM4 and has the relevant BIOS update then you will have a setting for Kombo Strike in the CPU overclocking settings, which will essentially undervolt your 5800X3D by 30millivolts, meaning more efficient energy use and less heat, a setting that is within manufacturers safe tolerances too.Following the above I was very pleased with the improved thermals, after adjusting fan profiles (I just set case fans to a noise level I could accept and stuck them there, whilst letting GPU and CPU be managed by PWM curve based on temp).On a side note, whilst going through the above, I stumbled across 2 fundamental things I had overlooked in the past:1. TPM settings for RAM, it turns out I had never been utilising my RAM frequency as I should have (rookie mistake), when I activated TPM mode 2, I noted an additional boost to RAM frequency and FPS in certain games2. I discovered that the above mentioned bios update also facilitated the use of SAM (Smart Access Video), which in essence allows your CPU and GPU to communicate much faster (very basic explanation) assuming your hardware supports it. In some instances this has lead to an almost 20% boost in game FPS....and it is a free setting you may already have and not realise if you have an AM4 motherboard.Regarding the above mentioned cyberpunk, ultra setting FPS jumped to 215 fps using AMD 2.1 on Performance setting, but I would recommend Intel settings on Quality (185 fps) for eye candy.FYI I'm, not a Cyberpunk fanboy...it was just the most reliable benchmark I had at hand to task both CPU and GPU on mixed settings.Long story short, best of a CPU if you have a good AM4 board and want to wait and skip AM5 at present, AM6 isn't that far away :DPS is you are a user of AMD video cards and experience frame stutter, clear the V cache (google it) or just remove adrenalin and install the base driver without adrenalin fixed my issues in Hogwarts, RD2, Cyberpunk, BG3....Happy gaming

I upgraded to this from the 5600x. I’m currently running a 4070ti with the 5800x3d and the performance is perfect for 1440p gaming. Seen a lot of feedback saying that the cpu needed undervolted to deal with temps but I’ve not had any problems at all with the stock settings after updating the motherboard bios.

Outstanding CPU
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2023Style Name: Processor OnlyVerified Purchase
Straight drop in replacement (with latest BIOS pre-loaded) for a Ryzen 3600 in an X570 Asus motherboard. Once in, I applied an undervolt in this way: I accessed Precision Boost Overdrive in my motherboard's BIOS (if you don't know what this is, just press the ""delete"" key on your keyboard a lot during boot up). Set the Curve Optimiser to ""All Cores"", ""Negative"" by a value of ""30"", and then set ""PPT limit"" to ""100"", ""TDC limit"" to ""70"" and ""EDC"" limit to ""100"". That makes the CPU run marginally faster but crucially, much cooler and much more efficient. I tested the undervolt on Prime 95 which is a CPU stress testing software that generates Prime Numbers over and over to make the CPU work really hard. If you notice instability with these settings, then set all PPT, TDC and EDC back to their Auto defaults and then try Curve Optimiser All Cores Negative at only 25, then if still unstable, try 20, and so on, until you reach a negative value that is stable for you. Then apply the PPT, TDC and EDC and test again. You will have a great undervolt!

A superb game with ~20 hours total, but ~7 if you just want the story.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2023Platform: PlayStation 4Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
This is a review of the PS4 version run on a PS5. This version of the game includes a physical PS4 disc and a digital PS5 version. I plan to transfer my PS4 save to the PS5 version and pop every trophy for double Platinum. This is not possible to do the other way round (PS5 to PS4 version).The game is superb and runs almost flawlessly on the PS4. Spider-man Miles Morales set a year after the events of Spider-man PS4 (Remastered on PS5), where Miles Morales is getting to grips with his powers, a certain major event in Spider-man PS4, and Peter is on holiday in Europe with MJ, leaving New York City without any experienced defence against criminals and bad guys. It's upto Miles to take up the Spider-man mantle and defend the city.You start off with Peter to take down a rampaging Rhino through malls and a massive chase through the city, where eventually it leads to Roxxon headquarters and the main story begins. As you progress through the game, the people of Harlem and New York City see a different superhero with similar abilities to Peter Parker and start questioning whether they are the next big thing. After another major event (as seen at E3 and Comiccon close to the game's release) they realise the real problems are between Roxxon and the Underground, a group of resistance fighters who are against Roxxon's energy activity, and also have massive resources themselves.The game has a range of main bad guys with conflicts of interest and relationships to Spider-man and they are superbly and intricately fleshed out. I'm not going to go into spoilers but the only real complaint I have with the story is the main bad guy representing Roxxon, Simon Krieger, has not been fleshed out enough as a real threat and is just a generic rich corporate boss who pays others to do the dirty work.Like Spider-man PS4, this game is incredibly easy to pick up and play. You have all of the basic moves from Spider-man PS4, but what makes Miles different to Peter are his new abilities. Miles goes through an accident during the first mission and obtains new ""Venom"" powers (no relation to the character Venom), they become almost an essential resource to your gameplay. As you go through the game and obtaining new abilities and new ways of gameplay, you become engrossed with the development of Miles as a Spider-man. There is another ability you obtain later in the game which brilliantly expands on this but I'm not going to spoil it here.There are new skill trees in the game, and they are unlockable in the three categories combat, traversal and stealth. Each category has three challenges each through the map of New York City for you to tackle and progress, all leading to a Final Test. No spoilers here but it is a tough challenge, and you need to be very adept in your awareness abilities to beat it.Throughout the game you have Activities and Crimes to do, all logged into a list, available with a left swipe of the touchpad. This is a great addition to keep tabs on what is available and what you need to do.However one major downside is when you complete the Activities in the game (all except one which is locked until you beat the game for the first time), well, let's just say that they just couldn't help themselves. I'm not going to reduce the rating of this review because it is just one thing, but some could easily ram 1 stars solely for this one thing. Just a heads up.The game has a grain filter on by default which does slightly dull the graphics and colour. You can reduce this in the in game menus and vastly improve the graphics and the colour, everything pops with a modern view and this version looks even better than the Spider-man PS4 version, despite being practically an expansion of the same game.I took 14 hours to get every collectable and 100% every district, and I have New Game Plus left to play as of writing this review. New Game Plus has a unique suit, increased level cap, three new skills and new perks and mods to obtain. Having fully enjoyed the entirety of the game in my first playthrough and obtaining every trophy that can be obtained at this stage, I plan to play on Friendly Neighbourhood mode to be the ultimate Miles Morales and head straight for two Platinum trophies.

Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 November 2020Platform: PlayStation 4Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
*4 and a half out of 5*Insomniac’s mini-sequel/spin-off to the excellent 2018 Spider-Man. In Spider-Man: Miles Morales you play as the titular hero learning the ropes and responsibilities of being Spider-Man and having to take on a new villain known as the Tinkerer.With the PS5 not releasing until later this week (19th November) and it being near impossible to get a preorder of one, getting the PS4 version day one was always going to be the option, and when I do eventually enter the next generation this game comes with a free upgrade as well.Graphically the game is still phenomenal and builds upon the already excellent previous game. The snowy winter time setting, the golden lighting of the sun and Miles’ new dynamic electricity fuelled combat animations all stand out and its clear that Insomniac are teetering on the next generation technology even for the PS4 version.Gameplay takes the familiar elements from the previous game in terms of stealth, combat and swinging. The latter feeling even more acrobatic and natural, with Miles’ aerobic and charismatic animations as he grows in confidence and taking more risks in the role. In addition to the regular combat fisticuffs, Miles also has bonus ‘Venom’ (not the character your thinking of) powers that can be charged up and cause electrical devastation.The story is substantially shorter than its predecessor. I beat the main story in around 8 hours (possibly less) and cleared up all the side activities in another 3-4 hours, so really there is a solid amount of content here for a spin off. The story is engaging and has some excellent blockbuster sequences. The personal and family focused edge shines through, as well as Miles having to gain New York’s trust and respect. Aside from the very generic villain Simon Krieger, the other antagonists (Rhino, Tinkerer & Prowler) all are well implemented and have fun boss fights.As for negatives, the game can be a little choppy at times in terms of frame rate and a lot of the side missions are the usual and repetitive busy work for the minor crimes and hidden caches. However a couple do standout due to the personal investment, such as the sound matching Prowler side story, the Spider-Man training sims and the surprisingly emotional scavenger hunt left by Miles’ father.Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a great way to swing into the next generation (even on PS4). Bringing back everything great about the last game in terms of its gameplay, as well as adding and improving on it in some areas. The story whilst shorter is a blast to play through and the game looks fantastic and truly jaw dropping at times. Aside from some repetitive side missions, this is a near perfect smaller side title, that I can’t wait to see what’s next.

The swagger is not exaggerated here; awesome game!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 December 2020Platform: PlayStation 4Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
This game is awesome. The world/setting, plot, voice acting, and gameplay are all top notch. Loved the diversity and representation in the game, which was not at the expense of the story or anything. It would have been interesting to hear from Peter Parker's perspective what he thinks when people in Harlem say Miles is ""their"" Spider-Man, or how they feel Peter let them down if at all, but the writers don't explore that idea. Maybe next game?Miles' powers add a nice element to the game. The stealth missions were fun. Of course, swinging around New York never gets old and the graphics are incredible. People say the game is short, which admittedly it might be compared to monsters like Witcher 3, but you feel ""full"" and satisfied after playing it.If I had one bad thing to say about the game is that it does not bring back a lot of your usual Spider-Man enemies or cast members. There were maybe 4 character villains in the game, which I am not going to spoil for you. Only one of them was someone you'd think of off the top of your head when you hear the words ""Spider-Man villains"". There's another famous one that you can fight, in a way, but I won't go any further on that. Insomniac went all out with the villain usage in the previous game. Maybe they did not want to repeat that experience too much by shoehorning as many villains as possible here. I'm excited for the next game! Until then, I strongly recommend this one if you haven't played it already.

Yes it’s expensive, yes there’s no so much games exploiting the device, I knew that but I attended to buy it only to benefit from the immersive experience with Gran Turismo 7 which is basically one of the few games I’m playing with my PS5. I recommend it if you’ve the same attention, also, there are some statements from Sony to make the device compatible with PC games in the incoming months, if true this will definitely make the device even more attractive.

Switch on VR via function button, release the VR unit pushing the VR to your face so little or no light, only see the  PS5 VR2 display. Now just adjust until the image clear.

Brilliant VR Headset From A Virgin VR Gamer
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 May 2023Edition: PSVR2Verified Purchase
I have been tempted by VR for some years now. Years ago I looked into it for the OC but was put off by the specs needed to run the games and latterly lost a little interest due to the lack of AAA titles. I was tempted by the PS4 PSVR but never got around to getting a PS4 and once again the interest waned.After a VR day with friends, my interest was reignited. The whole experience was fantastic but the graphics on the VR day were a little disappointing and I was excited to see virtual 4K gaming via the PSVR2.First and foremost, the whole set up is straightforward. Having never dabbled in Meta Quest etc, I was a little apprehensive, and the box lay unopen for a couple of days as I convinced myself I'd need a full day to familiarise myself with the equipment. I needn't have worried.There's not much in the box. The headset itself and the two lightweight controllers, plus a USB C cable to charge the controllers, one at a time. There's also earphones and 3 pairs of sizes to fit all earholes. The one thing to note is the controllers came uncharged, and needed charging before setup could proceed. So if you're planning on getting this as a gift for someone who is impatient, bare this in mind.Once charged, set up was a doddle. Each stage from putting the headset on, to mapping to your eyes and mapping out your room is done with short animations. The buttons on your headset are shown in front of you if you're worried where to press on your head, and then you're away.One thing you may have read about is the ""sweet spot"" of the headset. Unlike my virtual reality day, the tilt of the headset is critical as even a degree or two up or down will result in a slightly blurred image. At first I thought this was the resolution, but it's simply fixed by tilting up or down and then tightening the headset.I've got Star Wars Galaxy's Edge and Gran Turismo and I'm blown away. The visual fidelity is unreal and I will review those games separately. It's hard to believe you have 360 degree reality around you with a home set up. Of course the whole hardware costs are £1000 so you need to ask yourself how much into gaming you are.For me as a casual gamer I have no regrets. So far i'm asking myself whether to invest another £200 into a steering wheel and pedals, and this is from someone who has previously had no interest in driving games. So far the catalogue is pretty sparse, to my mind. I'm looking forward to The Walking Dead and the VR version of Resident Evil 4, which alone may make it all worthwhile.As a virgin at all this, I'm very impressed so far and I think a steering wheel and Gran Turismo alone would make me feel like a I have full simulator at home.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2024Edition: PSVR2Verified Purchase
I loved the OG PSVR and was expecting big things from this but it's much the same.Some of the features are cool, the external viewing/tracking cameras mean you don't have to take off the headset to find controllers and view surroundings and the way you setup the play area feature is great.The viewing area is slightly larger and a little clearer but the graphics of the games are dependant on the game - if the format is for the PSVR,  theres no real difference in quality really.  And since theres still a poor selection of new games,  you will probably still want to play the older titles (though quite a few have been upgraded now) so don't sell your old set until you're ready to leave those games behind.Much much easier to set it all up - literally 1 cable straight to the PS5.  An important thing to note is that this system works best in LIGHT environments where the PSVR was better in the DARK.Also the quick menus for accessing stuff like volume and screen size aren't as accessible as they were on the PSVR/PS4.  You have to go through the main settings to adjust stuff.  A chore and not as fluid as the previous version.The controllers feel weird,  not ergonomically shaped so it's a good idea to buy silicone grips or button stickers.  Also,  the round circular bit of the controller that goes around your wrist is quite a distance (1-2 inches) -  on some games I can guarantee you will hit yourself in the face or the headset.Controller battery life is poor (2-3 hrs) and you can tell when they start to die as they fail to track before they go dead which results in you thinking you played poorly etc.Even with these gripes,  it's still genuinely a great product. Worth it for anyone new to VR,  but not worth the jump from the original PSVR at its current price unless more quality games become available (there are currently a few decent ones but theres also a lot of low dev rubbish).

A Little Tricky at first but huge amount of fun
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 March 2024Verified Purchase
Firstly I'd say that this game needs someone to act as ""Claudia""......that in itself is a fun role to play and like the TV show, this is very entertaining.  The instructions are a little on the complex side and you need to read them through a few times carefully to make sure you get each phase of each round right but don't let that put you off as this game will make you laugh a lot.....the more players the better and be prepared to run around your house screaming like a bunch of crazy people.The only slightly disappointing element is once you've played this game 6 times, you'll not be able to play again as you'll know what's going on as you progress through the rounds.....hopefully they will release new mission cards to add to it at a later date.

more complicated than it needs to be.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024Verified Purchase
We enjoyed watching the TV program and thought to purchase the game, although some elements of the game keep your interest going for a while, it's not the type of game you can easily learn especially if someone's never watched the program, but also the instructions are somewhat confusing. Could have been much better.

Fun but takes a while to get the hang of it
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2024Verified Purchase
We played this game with the minimum number of people (4) but think it would be better with the maximum number (6 or 8?). It's good fun and not difficult to play, but there are lots of different steps and sections, so you need to read through the instructions as you play for the first couple of games. I also recommend reading through before you are ready to set up and play as there are a few things you need to have to hand to get the full experience, such as a timer/stopwatch and having music available to mask the sound of the traitor! good fun though and well-made board etc.

In today's digital world, clear and crisp video conferencing is essential for remote work, online classes, and social interactions. I was eager to test out the Webcam HD 1080p Web Camera USB to see if it could deliver on these expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised by its performance. What I Liked Superior Image Quality: The webcam consistently produces sharp and vibrant images, even in low-light conditions. I was particularly impressed with the color accuracy, which ensures that my skin tones and surroundings look natural. Wide Viewing Angle: The 110-degree wide-angle lens provides a generous field of view, allowing me to fit multiple people into the frame without sacrificing image quality. This feature is particularly useful for group video calls and presentations. Easy Setup and Compatibility: The webcam was incredibly easy to set up. I simply plugged it into my computer's USB port, and it automatically recognized and installed the necessary drivers. It's compatible with a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.Plug-and-Play Convenience: The webcam is truly plug-and-play, making it ideal for spontaneous video calls or presentations. I didn't have to fiddle with any settings or drivers, and it was always ready to use. What I Used It For I primarily used the webcam for video conferencing with colleagues and friends. It was also a great tool for online lectures and presentations. The clear audio and video quality made it a pleasure to communicate with others, and the wide-angle lens was particularly useful for group interactions. Overall Impression The Webcam HD 1080p Web Camera USB is an excellent choice for anyone who needs a high-quality webcam for video conferencing, online classes, or social interactions. Its superior image quality, wide viewing angle, easy setup, and integrated microphone make it a versatile and convenient tool for all your video needs. I highly recommend this webcam to anyone seeking a reliable and affordable solution for clear and crisp video communication. Rating: 3 stars

5 stars all roundFlavour: It has a lovely dark sweet flavour to it. But doesn't burn your throat too much. Or maybe I'm used to it.Value for money: Is debateable with alcohol, I drink once or twice a year, so a bottle tends to last me a long time. But given that a rum and coke in a pub would use an inferior rum and cost a large amount of money, you're far better off with this beautiful drink!Presentation: The bottle is beautiful, has little handles on it and the label has a Kraken drawn on it. I bought this initially because it looks cool. And I still buy them. One every two years. Or more, depending how the year went.It's my go to drink of choice and you'll find none better in my opinion.It has flavour, it looks nice, and it's much cheaper than the pub. Plus you get the chance that you can talk about a different rum than Morgans with friends. Everyone will always assume you drink Morgans, till you correct them! You're not just a rum drinker, you're a Kraken black spiced rum drinker, sounds much more interesting.

Great console and just as I remembered.  I bought a Mario game to go with it and there I was.......hooked again!  I love this console.  You can keep your Playstations and Xboxes.  Nice controller with just the right number of buttons.  Don't like others with numerous buttons I can never remember what they do (though I normally just press everything - it seems to work out ok, especially if I am fighting lol).  Overall in very good condition and everything works.  I've ordered an expansion pack as I remember some games need one.  Fore armed and all that. Also ordered a memory pack to go in the controller.  Great Console.  Very good condition.  Great price.  Highly recommended.

Did not work properly- but now does.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 August 2017Verified Purchase
N64 does not work properly. Resets itself every hour or so in the middle of a game. Extremely annoying.Edit: After a week or so of playing, the console gradually began to not reset itself anymore, and in the end it worked perfectly. To the seller's credit, when I informed them of the issue, They offered to swap consoles or alternatively give me a full refund. All in all, a good purchase and I have updated my rating to 5 star.

The product also shows very few to marking and has up to date PAT testing stickers on it from the start of this year. I would advise buying the adaptor to go into av cable or HDMI instead of the standard Ariel port

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 May 2016Verified Purchase
Console works great, be aware the cable it comes with doesn't work 100% with newer TV's, it makes the screen appear super bright which was a nightmare. Ended up purchasing a modded cable after a couple of google searches which has made the picture great.Unfortunately I had to remove a star due to the controllers. After seshing Mario Kart for 5 months we noticed that whoever was controller three seemed to be losing more often than the other two controllers from a separate purchase. Upon inspection the 'Nintendo' controller that came with this purchase had a loose steering mechanism, when you flick it with its thumb it is looser than the other purchased controllers meaning that it doesn't respond great. Whilst this is probably due to the age of the console and controller it is the only area of disappointment in my purchase.

Coming from a Samsung Note 9, the performance still holds up today but due to its outdated camera and depleted battery performance; and the fact I dropped my phone numerous times in water and has finally given up on me lol - I decided it was time for an upgrade.This is the first time I bought a refurbished device on Amazon so was initially nervous on the condition once it arrived as the advert didn't specify the condition of the item. It was immaculate - like brand new when I finally got my hands on it. No scratches or dents, even on the sides which tend to accumulate with wear & tear.  It didn't arrive in it's originally packaging but was well protected in bubble wrap with the essentials included.Display is vibrate, performance of the UI is quick and fluid, and the camera is superb.  Full charge has easily lasted me a full day with moderate use.Paying just £350 for a 2 year old flagship phone, has got to be one of my greatest bargain purchases of the decade.Pros: Performance, Display, Camera, Battery Life, S Pen compatibilityCons: None at the moment5/5

Brilliant condition phone, without a mark on it. It was a little dirty in the charging port and in the hairline gaps around the edge, but nothing that caused an issue and very easy to clean. My only minor gripe is the battery, they state it'll have 80% or greater compared to new, and it arrived with 81% life. Within their spec, which is why I won't mark them down on it, but you always hope for the higher end of the scale!Overall, I would definitely buy again - and with Amazon's amazing 365day return policy, what's not to like?!

The Samsung Galaxy S21 has been a game-changer for me, and it's undoubtedly one of the best smartphones I've ever owned. Absolute stunner to look at. The 6.2” screen is nothing short of breathtaking. The colours are vibrant, and the video content look absolutely stunning. The screen is also bright enough to be easily readable in direct sunlight. The camera is impressive and was the main reason for buying. The triple-lens setup delivers stunning photos in various lighting conditions. The AI-powered features and 8K video add to its versatility. The Pro mode allows for more advanced photography with full manual control (apart from aperture) Super Slo motion at 950 fps is brilliant fun. Battery life quite good. The 4000mAh battery gets me through a full day of use, even with heavy usage and hot spot enabled. Fast charging, wireless charging, and the ability to reverse wireless charge is helpful. Fingerprint scanner and facial recognition. Both work quickly and provide an extra layer of security.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 June 2023Wireless provider: Unlocked for All CarriersColour: Phantom BlackMemory storage capacity: 128 GBVerified Purchase
Phone showed up and it's condition was really good, first impressions were good. Started using the phone and realised the company can't have tested the phone, the primary camera wouldn't focus on anything beyond 2 feet Infront of you. So contacted them and they were helpful, tried the troubleshooting and it didn't work. So they agreed to take the phone back and sent labels. This is where things went downhill fast.They confirmed receipt of the phone and said they will be back in touch in 1-3 working days. 10 days later I heard nothing from them, so chased them. They came back saying they never received the phone and could I supply tracking info, even though they had already confirmed they had received it. Explained this to them and they came back saying there had been a delay in processing due to the bank holiday, they received the phone a week before the bank holiday. At every point their customer service was rude and lied. It has taken almost 3 weeks to finally get them to confirm a refund, after me finally having to go to Amazon and them putting pressure on them as well. This isn't the first time the exact same thing happened either, first time was for an iPhone and the exact same thing happened. Renewed phones on Amazon are great, just this company is not. If you want to buy with the comfort of easily returning what you have bought, do not buy from these.

But basically although it has 20 different answers available they are really only of 'Yes' and 'No' and vague responses in between including 'ask again'! I am 73 so when I was a kid we had far more fun things to play with but that's not the point here I guess!! I don't doubt this will be appreciated but will be put aside pretty quickly.  It's a shame - more non-recyclable plastic waste!Clearly this is written by a grumpy old man but at least it will light my grandson's face up! Received promptly as usual from Amazon.

""Will I regret purchasing this magic 8 ball?"" ""You may rely on it"". This hasn't become the case yet! Indecision is no longer a thing for me - when in doubt consult the 8 ball, this will be your mantra. It does sometimes get stuck on the edge between two answers but I kind of like that - sort of implies you already know the answer or simply shouldn't ask the question! I first saw one on Toy Story and have wanted one ever since. You won't regret buying it! Accept life's chaotic nature, leave all the anxiety-causing stressful choices up to the divine eightball, everything happens for a reason - and that reason is the eightball.

About as good as the SNES mini, which is very, very good.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 March 2020Verified Purchase
This is a fantastic little package. The love and care that went into creating the mini console and controllers is even greater than Nintendo's two previous efforts. In terms of game selection, these haven't aged quite as well as the Super Nintendo mini. I'd say, purely for the games, the SNES mini is a better package, but taking into account the hardware too, I'd say they're roughly equal. Some of the games just won't hold your interest, like Space Harrier 2, Columns, Tetris, Alex Kid, Landstalker, Comix Zone, Altered Beast and golden Axe.Games that still hold up on this include Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Thunder Force 3, Castle of Illusion, Dynamite Headdy, Shinobi 3, Streets of Rage 2, Castlevania Bloodlines, Gunstar Heroes, Ghouls and Ghosts/Probotector, Contra: Hard Corps. Phantasy Star 4 and Shining Force are highly regarded too. Street Fighter 2 is a great game too, but the Megadrive sound is a bit weak and you don't really want to play it with a 3 button controller. Some people thing that this should have come with the 6 button pad, but that would kill the nostalgia factor for most of us. We grew up with and have nostalgia for the 3 button controller, even if it is a bit limited.As for missing games, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic and Knuckles are the biggest omissions. there's no reason not to have them. Revenge of Shinobi 1 and Streets  of Rage 1 are also sorely missed. And personally, I'd have liked QuackShot Starring Donald Duck, Gaiares and Lightning Force too. Fortunately, you can hack the Megadrive mini and add any games you feel are missing from the collection. The internal storage is tiny however, so anyone hoping to add Sega CD or 32X games is in for a headache.I've been playing this on a HD tv in gaming mode and haven't noticed the input and sound lag that has been reported. I'm sure it is there, but I think you would have to be very sensitive to such things to even notice it.I paid £55 or 65 Euros, which I think is a very fair price, and for anyone who's looking for some Megadrive nostalgia, using real Megadrive controllers, lots of games handily in the box, and without the hassle of hooking up a real Megadrive to a HD tv in 2020, this is a great option!

A brilliant recreation of the classic Sega Mega Drive
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 April 2020Verified Purchase
I bought this as a pure nostalgia hit and I must say it didn't disappoint! Firstly the product itself is beautifully packaged, with the graphics of the console on the front and all the original covers of the games on the back and it really makes you look forward to taking the thing out and playing it.As to the device itself, yes it's small, but perfectly proportioned, they have even made it so that the cartridge slot opens and closes. Ok, so you don't need a working looking cartridge slot, but it's a really nice touch. And I think the aesthetics of any of these mini-consoles are important as they really give you a feel for the quality of the product itself. Talking of quality and quantity, you get 42 mostly classic games here. So there are always one or two clunkers in any selection like this, but in general pretty much every game has it's merits, and some are such classics such as the Sonic games that they just speak for themselves. I really found myself becoming that excited young lad playing these games again, it does bring back that excitement. Most of them I had not played for well over 25 years and they still play really well and I have to say the emulations are spot on. I can't notice any lag in sound or video personally and they look crystal clear on a modern large screen TV. It's also nice that you can keep to the original 4/3 ratio, which is the way they are meant to be played. The controllers too are really first rate and feel good in the hands and do what you expect. Although, yes you could do with a 6 button controller to mash to really get into games like Streets of Rage II, saying that I still really enjoyed revisiting this brilliant beat em up again, a truly great game and just great fun, which is the whole point of little consoles like this.All in all a fantastic nostalgia hit for any gamer, beautifully packaged and made from Sega and just brings back the good old days of 16 bit gaming. A mini modern classic!

AT Last, not AT Games, it's taken AGES to produce a decent Mega Drive console, well done SEGA
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2020Verified Purchase
Having experienced a few of the previous plug & play Mega Drive consoles, when I heard Sega were going to produce their own mini classic version I was very excited, because at last, we should get a console that plays and sounds the way we remember, and it's been worth the wait.Sega have done themselves proud, by essentially recreating their famous 16bit Mega Drive console, but in a mini form factor, and with lots of 'good' games built-in. I own a few of these mini classics, in addition to my originals, and the attention to detail, and build quality on this one is absolutely fantastic, even the volume slider moves, and the controllers look & feel every bit as good as the originals (3 button pads included, but for street fighter ideally you'll want the 6 button pads). Obviously views on things like the choice of included games is subjective, but I think they've hit the right spot, in terms of popular titles, quality and quantity, with each game essentially costing just £1 at the current console price of £59.95 or so. The game selection menu itself is simple to use, and easy on the eye, and of course the games themselves never looked so good over HDMI, rather than the old RF or composite / scart. One of the problems with all the other so called mega drive machines is the sound tended to be slow, or scratchy etc, but of course Sega have done a sterling job, with no such problems evident on this console.I have to admit, from a collectors point of view, I live the attention to detail and small size, sits nicely on the shelf, but more importantly, the games are still really good fun to play, highlighting just how far Sega were able to push the technology of the time during the 16bit era. Just to really set the era, why not watch a few of their infamous Sega TV ads, brilliant!If your a Sega fan, I'd highly recommend, and if your a Nintendo fan, aren't you curious as to what Sega did and nintendon't?

 I got this Flash mop and have used it a couple of times so thought i would have a crack at reviewing it. Firstly the good: The mop is so easy to put together and takes seconds to fit in all the right places. The wet wipes it comes with smells absolutely really nice and fresh and is really well saturated in the liquid to the point that excess liquid will fall out of the packet when opening. The wipes are also easy to fit in and would be able to use most standard large sized floor wipes on it to save money.The mop cleans well as you can see from the picture, it has picked up a fair amount of dirt and dust and the wipe is usually good enough for a standard sized kitchen floor. The mop is really lightweight so can be used by pretty much anyone. It also come apart just as quick as it is to put together for easy storage.I have not yet used the dry wipes as have not felt the need to because with the wipes provided, the floor dries up pretty quickly, although i am sure that if i used my own floor cleaner the dry wipes would come in handy:The not so good: Whilst the mop is really lightweight, it doesn't feel sturdy and almost goes far as feeling flimsy at times. You do have to push really hard to get stains out but i fear that if you push it hard enough it may break, and even then i have not had much luck with tough stains. I get much better results getting on my hands and knees and scrubbing the stains the old fashioned way.Also i would say that if you are planning to only use the flash floor mops with the mop it may work out quite expensive as i found one mop to only have enough capability for one kitchen so if you are planning to go over a whole house, you could find yourself getting through a few wipes.All that being said though the mop is still very useful as it is great for using regularly to keep on top of the cleaning and then using another gadget for a more deep clean as it is still great for greas or weaker stains and general dirt. I would still recommend despite its negatives.

It's ok for small floor area
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2024Style Name: All-In-One Floor Mopping System (4 Wet + 4 Dry Pads)Verified Purchase
Got this for quick freshen up in between ""proper"" mopping. It's very lightweight and the handle was just long enough for me (I'm 5'4""). Some reviews say the wipes are too wet and others that they do not cover enough of the floor before drying out. There is excess liquid in the container which you can use up (I just tipped a bit more of this out each time). I like that the item is easy to assemble and the wipes are wet enough to provide a quick clean in between ""proper"" mopping. If you have friends coming and you want to make the floor look fresh before they arrive, a quick swipe with these works a treat. If you have any stubborn marks though, the wipes don't really tackle this and the mop head is not stable enough to direct and scrub - it just flops around (if this makes sense?). I had to get down on hands & knees and scrub with the rough bit of the wipe to tackle it.  For a good thorough clean, I'd be inclined to use a regular mop, but it's great for a freshen up.

This was recommended by a friend.  Fantastic to quickly clean your wooden or bathroom tiled floors.  This saves me cleaning a mop each time and in a small apartment this is just ideal.  I thought the dry mops heads would be a gimmick, but after a hoover with the Dyson I used a dry mop and picked up more dust!  The wet mops is where this comes into it's own.  It is so convenient to clean your floor properly with these.  They smell nice and are robust.  I think there are 4 wet and 4 dry that come with the kit so you can try them out.  I  even use it to clean the windows!

It's great to use for small spaces like studios and student dorms; light and easy to assemble, it makes it less complicated to clean. The only issue is that its not as sturdy, you may not want to press on it too hard to scrub something because it starts to bend, but that's to be expected. Otherwise, its a great mop, just not for long term use.

***EDIT: Played the game now, firstly the game is pretty good, similar to the first but with modest improvements(only done the very first mission so far - but it’s long). Be warned though, the game is still buggy, video sequences sometimes crash and a restart of the game is required to get back into it. Audio still plays like the game is moving along but video is frozen. The one gameplay difference that is worse is my opinion in it feels a lot more sensitive and jarring when moving the camera around. On the whole so far the game feels good though. I would recommend playing it.***Not played yet, here for folk with a slow download speed. There is a 150GB download to complete before you can even play from the looks of it. If you’re desperate to play just bear this in mind. Even with 380mbps which is roughly 45MBps real time download, it’s taking a good while.To get actual download speed, divide your mbps by 8. This will give you the real time speed of your connection (bits to Bytes conversion).Couldn’t the game makers have included 2 disks for this game for people with slow download speeds? Feels like cost cutting wins every time these days. For those of you with near dial up speeds, I suspect we will be in a galaxy far far away before the download completes…

Great Game (99% Fixed!)
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2023Verified Purchase
The Positives:The game is absolutely brilliant and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a vast improvement on the first one (which I really enjoyed), and the added fast travel makes it way less frustrating when you need to collect all the chests, databank entries etc.The stances and skill tree have been upgraded and the customisation is also far better (although not enough ponchos!). I made sure Cal sported a manly mullet and handlebar moustache for pretty much the whole game and I didnt need to fight 99% of the enemies as they cowered at his super machismo appearance ;-)I loved the main planet Koboh as although it has 'linear' parts it felt more open worldy and I spent most of the first part of the game exploring.The map is better than the first game; not great, but better!The Negatives:The game reverted to an old save and I lost about 5 hours of gameplay, which I was far from impressed with. In 2023 you should be able to have multiple saves rather than 1, so EA need to get out of the dark ages and fix this bug as other people have experienced this when looking online.Performance mode is pointless as it lags on the PS5. What is the point of having it if it doesn't work!!?The cutscenes are laggy and had the speech missing a few times. Good old subtitles!There were a few points where the characters adopted a Cristiano Ronaldo goal pose when waiting to travel to another planet and Cal's lightsaber started spinning around on his back  lots of times when on the Mantis.It only crashed once, but lost about 20-30 minutes of collecting chests etc.Overall I believe they have fixed most of the main bugs and it was fantastic seeing all the old characters growing and I loved the action and engaging plot.The main tips I would like to share are......If you complete certain quests / side quests you will unlock the location of certain collectibles on the map. I thought there was an issue / glitch with the game, but one quest unlocks chests, one quest unlocks databanks, one quest unlocks treasures etc, so don't expect all the collectibles to be displayed until you've done all these quests.The other thing is that you need to speak to everyone in the bar regularly to unlock missions, details about the characters, bounties etc. When you think it is glitched (the bounties not updating was a great example of this), just save it, and go back and chat to them over and over again or continue to progress the story and you will be able to Platinum the game and get all collectibles.Put a strap on your control pad as there are 2 boss battles where your control pad will be close to being launched at the TV!I would definitely recommend playing this and the first one and hopefully EA will release another one soon, without the glitches.

Fantastic game so far.....
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 April 2023Verified Purchase
Okay, so I'm about 3 hours into the game. I play slowly so I can take in all the scenery, find all the hidden pieces and generally wander around. I'm not one for a speed run.The game picks up with Cal and BD1 on a mission from the start. Your force powers are great starting off with and you very quickly learn to use a double bladed lightsaber and also weild dual lightsabers. Oh, you also have all colours of kyber crystal for customisation.The game mechanics work well. But every so often there are glitches in the frame rate. Not much to be bothersome, but you do notice it. Doesn't affect gameplay, more so visually.So far the game is great with the storyline, jedi powers, missions and additional support from your team. There is so much more going on.Like I said I'm 3 hours in. I've completed the first mission and am now about 8% through the first planet.....told you it wasn't a speed run.I think updates in the coming weeks will fix the minor graphic glitch. Aside from that it is really fun and enjoyable right now, and there is a heap more to go.

This product is simply brilliant.  Easy to use and all the food is cooked quickly and is really hot.  The insert plates can be cleaned in a dishwasher and the two pans come up really clean with a little washing up liquid.  Everything I have made or heated through has been very well received by my husband.  It is so versatile as you can synchronise the two pans if required.  Well worth buying.

Ninja Foodi Dual Zone Air Fryer - Cooking Made Easy
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 August 2023Verified Purchase
I've had the chance to explore the Ninja Foodi Dual Zone Air Fryer with 2 Drawers, and I'm excited to share my thoughts about this handy kitchen gadget.What I really like is how user-friendly this air fryer is. You can cook with less or even no oil, which is a big plus for healthier meals. The highlight is the double drawers – they let you cook two things at once, a real time-saver. If you're in the mood for two different treats, like chips or snacks, these drawers have got your back. And don't forget the sync button that sets both drawers to the same settings in one click.Another cool thing is the energy efficiency. It saves up to 75% on electricity bills, which is quite impressive. You've got options like Max Crisp and Dehydrate, giving you flexibility in your cooking. The speed is great too, though there's a bit of a learning curve. This air fryer might just replace your oven, making it a valuable kitchen addition.And oh, the drawers! They have a smart non-stick design that makes cleaning a breeze. No more stuck-on food hassles. It adds to the overall ease of using the Ninja Foodi Dual Zone Air Fryer. With its double-drawer system, efficiency, and speedy results, it's a solid pick for any kitchen. While there's a bit to learn and its size might need consideration, the benefits make it a worthy choice for those who want hassle-free and efficient cooking.

pays for itself....
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2023Verified Purchase
The best thing about this product is that it pays for itself through energy savings  Since getting this Ninja my deep fat fryer is now obsolete, my grill is almost obsolete and my oven hasn't been used since.This product cooks great chips but one does have to learn a little first.  When cooking chips it's critical that one folows the instructions and washes the potato starch out before air frying them otherwise they will burn.  Next one needs to work out the times and temperatures for different potato varieties  as cooking times do vary between the different types.  Once one has a good idea of the cooking times and temperatures chips are quickly produced in the air fryer.Although the air fryer works well there are the other options available; Roast, Bake, Dehydrate, Max Crisp and reheat.  As the saying goes, ""practice makes perfect"" and it certainly applies to this Ninja.  One has fun messing with this product as one tries to find the best and most successful way to cook food.  Roasting duck breasts is a typical example.  I have cooked them with the Roast option but I have found that they cook best by giving them 8 minutes on Roast followed by six minutes on Max crisp to get the skin well cooked and crispy.As  my images show, this ""compact cooker"" roasts some great chicken quarters.  The same applies with the chicken as it does the duck, partially roast the chicken and finish off using the max crisp setting which operates at 240c and that is 10c higher than domestic ovens so it cooks and crisps skin perfectly and quickly.I have used this Ninja for toasting garlic bread slices and it does it much quicker and much better than my Solarplus grill does so that is something exceptional.As this Ninja has much smaller cavities than a domestic oven it can rapidly heat up, that is how it works.  When cooking there is no need to preheat the Ninja as the cavities reach their temperatures in a matter of a small few seconds and that is where the energy savings come into play.  By not having to pay to preheat a large cavity domestic oven ones uses much less energy thus one isn't paying the 30p+ per kWh for an element that requires a 3.6+kWh input.  If one has a cheap cooker then it's cheap for a reason... it needs more energy thus it would probably use a good kWh just to preheat the oven so one can easily be paying 40p to 50p just to warm the oven up.  A more expensive cooker, like mine, can have triple glazing in the oven doors thus they are much more enrgy efficient and save money when comared to cheaper cookers.  As the Ninja only has to heat up a small space the food is cooking almost immediately and it does cook evenly.I did mention duck, chicken and garlic bread but what about roasting coffee beans?  I did think about it and after doing a little reading online I tried it.  I don't advise using this Ninja for roasting coff beans as it does become ""expensive"".  Many people claim that one can get a ""dark roast"" in six to eight minutes, with others claiming it takes around 15 minutes.  Well, I don't believe any of them have actually tried it as even after a good 1/2 hour the beans were only light roasted.  To get a dark roast will tale close to one hour at the highest temperature so that becomes costly for a small amount of coffe bean.  One can invest in a domestic coffee bean roaster but personally I do prefer to do it the traditional way, which is much more cost effective.  One simply puts the beans into a pan (frying pans are good for this) or a traditional roasting pan that imported.  Next, one simply heats the pan on a high heat hob or gas burner for a few minutes.  Whilst the beans are roasting one simply stirs them around from time to time.  A light roast, like what the Ninja produced, can be obtianed in only two to three minutes with a dark raost taking around five mionutes.  What the Ninja produced in 1/2 hour would have taken me around 10 minutes and I would have got two small batches of dark roast for my espressos.So, this Ninja is excellent for cooking almost anything but there will be the exception such as my fresh green bean coffee.It is so easy to keep clean so that is a very good bonusOne thing I did note from some negative reviews is that some reviewers gave negative ratings and claimed the product is fauly because ""lots of steam"" was coming out.  Well, I can honestly say that is not the case.  The problem is not with the Ninja but is with the user.  During my second use of this I seen some steam coming out and instantly worked it out that the pan hadn't been insertred correctly.  When using the Ninja it is important to insert the pans flush so that they are firmply sealed with the machione otherwise steam will escape thus cooking will be uneven and will take longer.  As soon as I seen the steam I simply pulled pan number one out a bit and reinserted it thus no more steam.  Another issue with those that cook with incorrectly positioned pans is that apart fromcosting more to cook the food and not cooking the food well... it will dry the food.The steam from the cooking food is part of the cooking process and helps keep the food moist but losing the water will mean the food, especially meats, will go dry.Overall I am impressed with my Ninja and I should have bought one much sooner than I did as it is saving me money, it is saving me a lot of time and most importantly it produces some excellently cooked food.  One day I will risk it and try to make some jam in it and maybe even dehydrate some fruits.  If successful thenit will mean my dehydrater will become obsolete aling with my deep fat fryer.I am recommending this product as it is made to a high quality standard, it works very well and with the energy and cost savings this is very good value.

The ninja dual zone Air fryer has a huge 7.6 L total capacity. There is two individual baskets which are 3.8 L each. It has six programs, which are Air fry, roast, bake, dehydrate, Max crisp and reheat. If you are only going to use one of the baskets then zone one is the default zone to cook with, but what I particularly like about this is that for instance you can air fry at 200° in zone one for 30 minutes and you can roast in zone two at 180° for 20 minutes at the same time by pressing sync and then start.  This will start zone one and when it reaches the 20 minute timer zone two will come off of hold and start roasting. If you remove the basket such as for chips to give them a shake, then the timer will pause until The basket is re-inserted and if both zones are cooking it will pause both timers. The other option that I really like which is nice and easy and can maximise your output if you’re cooking the same thing, For example if you had to Air fryer 1.5 kg of chips. Then place your chips in both baskets and on the zone one display enter in your temperature timer and press match then start. This will duplicate all of the information to zone two, Which makes it easy and super efficient. The max crisp is set at 240° and this is the only function that The temperature can’t be changed, and it could be set to a maximum time of 30 minutes. The air fryer function can be set between 150 and 210° and has a time range between 1 minute to 1 hour. The roast function allows you to use the ninja as a conventional oven which has a temperature range of 120 to 210° and has a timer that can be set from one minute to four hours. The reheat function has a temperature setting of 130 to 210° and can be set from 1Minute to One hour. The dehydrate function allows you to gently remove moisture from meat, vegetables and fruits. This temperature can be set between 40 to 90° and has a set time of up to 12 hours allowing you to create healthy snacks. The bake function means that you don’t have to wait the usual 10 to 15 minutes that your conventional oven would take to pre-heat Which is perfect if you just want to knock up a quick dessert. The temperature setting is 120 to 210° and has a time range between 1 minute to 4 hours. This ninja air fryer is super easy to clean, compare to my previous Tower Air fryer baskets. Overall we are very satisfied with our purchase as it has so many functions, Not just an air fryer. I hope you have found my review helpful.

I needed some of the pyramid PG Tips Teabags as they taste great, and this was the cheapest and quickest way to get them.Unfortunately PG Tips have changed their tea, not only have they now gone to square bags (this in itself isn't a problem) but they've changed their blend to one that they claim can brew in under a minute. The issue is I think the new ones taste awful. I didn't realise they'd changed when I added a large box to my online grocery delivery, there wasn't anything about it shown clearly on the box either. No shops had the pyramid brew in stock locally but thankfully Amazon to the rescue. Getting 4 of the larger boxes here means Ive got a box for my brother and the rest will last me through 2024.Apparently PG Tips have spent £50 million on their new blend and no one seems to like it! Grab these while you can.

PG Tips has been my comfort zone since I can remember, I have been in what felt like hell since my Original finished. Went shop and grabbed the pack but it felt strange so checked the packaging to make sure it was Original and saw that the packing was different and thought nothing of it coz its the taste I'm after and it said Original but once I got home and made a cuppa. The smell was weird and it tasted so nasty, even the after taste was horrible, gave me the urge to keep brushing my teeth and drink water to get rid of it but it didn't go away. At first I thought maybe I'm not well due to the weather, maybe its my taste bud that's off but after trying it couple times I knew it had nothing to with my taste but the company ruined something so perfect. I started trying different tea brands but none could give me the same comfort as the actual Original PG Tips and then I decided to check Amazon and OMA I didn't know I could be this happy over tea, I was a bit worried thinking what if they deliver the new horrible one but today when the delivery arrived, I left everything and ran to make a cuppa AND BOY I AM SO HAPPY AMAZON DIDN'T DISAPPOINT ME. THANK YOU! I am going to order as many as I can to last me as long as possible before there will be none left. It's my treasure, I will not be sharing with anyone :D while drinking it, I got emotional and teary... happy tears :P

I started trying different tea brands but none could give me the same comfort as the actual Original PG Tips and then I decided to check Amazon and OMA I didn't know I could be this happy over tea, I was a bit worried thinking what if they deliver the new horrible one but today when the delivery arrived, I left everything and ran to make a cuppa AND BOY I AM SO HAPPY AMAZON DIDN'T DISAPPOINT ME. THANK YOU! I am going to order as many as I can to last me as long as possible before there will be none left. It's my treasure, I will not be sharing with anyone :D while drinking it, I got emotional and teary... happy tears :P

 I love my Echo Shows!My little boy has an Echo Show 5 in his room, we have an Echo Show 10 in the Dining Room, and we have this Echo Show 15 in the Kitchen.Considering this Show 15 is the same price as the Show 10, it’s a no brainer - if you’ve got the space, get the Show 15. I mean, they both serve different purposes (the Show 10 has a built in sub and a much bigger speaker, and fits neatly in to a smaller gap, and is obviously free standing), but if I had to choose between buying the two again - I would hands down pick the 15. The motion sensor on the 10 doesn’t always want to play nicely and we frequently have to realign it as it goes off wherever it feels like (facing the wall for instance) and just stays there, so you can’t see the screen. But we’ve had no problems at all with the 15.This was easy to install on the wall, the template and the bracket supplied make it an easy job even for a DIY novice (such as myself!). Once installed, it’s neat and it’s secure, no movement on the wall. We’ve tacked the cable to run neatly across the top of the tiles to the plug socket so it looks really unobtrusive.Once set up, you’ll be impressed. It just works so well. You can have tiles on your main screen that denote various tasks you can do, you can have picture wallpaper, or if you wanted to, you could run a skill like I am in the video - this one is called Ambient Visions, and it can run constantly for 12 hours in a loop, there are loads of different effects to choose from, such as fireplaces, fish tanks, sea, rain, beaches, sleep stimulants etc. it’s brilliant. You can also have it with or without sound, but I’ve left the sound on here to hopefully show you how good the sound quality actually is.The picture quality is excellent, this is a really clear, bright screen. It’s big, so you can fit so much more information on it than the smaller shows, but I wouldn’t say it’s ridiculously huge or anything. It just looks like a moving picture frame hung on your wall! The brightness is good enough to see it clearly on a bright, sunny day. It doesn’t strain your eyes reading recipes or articles or anything like that.Sound quality is surprisingly excellent for what look like tiny little speaker grilles on the back. The volume goes high on this, you can get it blasting loud if you want to (I don’t!), and music is crisp and clear, with nuances perfectly well heard. It packs a decent amount of punch and bass too, I’ve heard instruments etc through this on songs I know well and love, that I’ve not heard through other speakers. This is one of the things I found surprising about this Show, I fully expected the sound to be tinny and lacklustre, but the sound quality is excellent.Alexa and voice recognition have both come on considerably. This is very good at picking up voices even from a distance. In fact, I can be stood right next to the Show 10 in a room two rooms away from the kitchen, and the 15 in the kitchen will pick up what I’m asking when the 10 next to me sometimes doesn’t. By and large, Alexa now gets it right far more often than she used to. She still has trouble with some song titles and artists, but I do listen to some obscure music to be fair. Generally speaking, the Show 15’s voice recognition and Alexa integration is far better than it used to be, and much better than any of the other Echos I have in the house.As you can probably tell from this review, I love the Show 15. I think it’s a brilliant bit of kit, works fantastically well and I’ve never had a spot of trouble with it. Dead easy to set up, use and rely on as your daily assistant. Mine hasn’t been buggy in the slightest, and touch wood, has never frozen or anything so far.I now wish the Show 15 had been out when I bought the Show 10 (it wasn’t), as without a shadow of a doubt, if you’re going to spend the £240 on a piece of kit, the 15 far outweighs the 10 in every way. The 10 is good, don’t get me wrong, but the 15 is in a class of its own.

My only problem (not with the echo but with The Alexa stuff in general) is that when my kids play a game, its always trying to get them to buy add ons and other unlimited things. So I get alot fo email saying this has been purchased, that has purchased, would you like to authorize this? Thats annoying, but the echo show itself is fantastic! Great picture, and functionality.

Really good to have in the kitchen
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 February 2022Verified Purchase
I wasnt sure about getting the show 15 or the show 10 to replace my old echo show 5.I love this Echo Show, its brilliant, but i think there are some improvements that can be made.Initially when i set it up i did have a few problems with group audio and i had to re-create the audio groups but since then it has been fine.The screen is very good, clear and shows some really useful stuff. The Photos look amazing and it automatically dims when it thinks no-one is there, saving power.We had a old echo show 5 before and the display information is 100 times better, but the sound isnt quite as good. Its a little tinny at times and suppose i need to add either a sub or studio to finish it off.I would really like this to be much bigger, say 24 or 28 inches, or make one that i can attach it to a TV of any size as an add on (i know i wont get the touch screen, but in reality i dont ever use the touch screen).I have a Samsung frame TV which sits totally flush to the wall and it would be nice to to see that kind of finish on the next the wall hung echo show. As is, it stands a little too proud of the wall than i would like, but if im honest its not really too much of an issue and i dont notice it often.In summary, it looks great but could look amazing.  It sounds ok, but you can add on a sub. Its much better than the older echo show for the screen content. Best thing is that it takes up no bench space and looks very neat and tidy in a modern kitchen.

I got this tablet as a Christmas gift for my sibling - they had an analog Bamboo graphic tablet for digital art however it was not cutting it. Needless to say, combined with an Apple Pencil, the iPads are a great tool for creatives. Combined with software like Procreate this turns a tablet into an artist's toolbox. The build and screen quality are great, and iOS makes sure this thing runs super fast. Very happy with my purchase - like most Apple products they are a bit pricey but retain their value quite well and for what you get, in my opinion, it's well worth the investment.

A Lightbulb moment
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2023Colour Name: Space GraySize Name: 256GBStyle Name: WiFiConfiguration: Without AppleCare+Verified Purchase
For the last 5 years my previous iPad was stuck in a drawer because I was finding that a combination of iPhone and Mac met my needs. However, I was spending long hours at my desk (which did nothing for posture) or tapping emails and documents on my iPhone (bad for eyesight and plenty of predictive text awkward words for thought or I mis-read) (also bad for RSI).Increasingly I handle home and work tasks on my phone and when I go away I lug my laptop. ‘Lug’ because although it is lightweight, once the fast charger cable and shock protection case are added in it becomes more cumbersome.Three days ago I started something off relaxed on the bed but it was slow and I was squinting so I had to treck to the study. I couldn’t figure out why I had stopped using the iPad, which by now was gathering dust. It is still okay but I compared screen size and weight with the Air 5th generation and decided that I could justify upgrading.I did look at the larger Pro (12 inch diagonal) but it was seven ounces heavier and larger screen size obviously means larger item of kit. Also the Pro has a lot of elements that are of use for graphic designers and the like and would be wasted in terms of my needs.Here I am. Moved data across to new iPad, synchronised Dropbox and Mail and I have a larger screen (enough to make a difference) and the latest in hardware. I use Mac dictate where suitable - it wasn’t safe on the iPhone because I failed to spot inaccuracies due to the screen size. I also took the plunge and bought a Magic Keyboard for work such as spreadsheets where I find it very difficult to handle on a tablet.Why a Mac tablet? Because there just seems to be more thought into the ergonomics and operating system. Also because I have been on a Mac desktop for several years and it is very reliable. I have full integration across 4 Mac devices (phone, tablet, laptop and desktop).Is the 5th generation a sea change? It is more an evolution but with a distinct and yet intangible difference. I usually upgrade every third year because year on year the changes are too small to justify the outlay even though I can get something on trade in.Has it changed my life compare with using the five year old one? No but it just has a better feel. Apple generations are iterative and a tweak here and an extra facility there make for a better experience, just as with changing a car after a while. It still only gets you from A to B but the journey is easier.Why buy from Amazon? Saved a few bob but mainly because Amazon is very good on the rare occasion I need to return an item. By contrast, Apple led me a merry dance when they delivered a piece of kit (a fast charger when I couldn’t find my laptop fast charger) and provided the wrong lead to go with it. All on a recorded call with Apple clearly stating the cable needed.If you are not sure which IPad you want, the Apple site offers a very clear side by side comparison and I read a coupe of technical reviews of the ‘which is best for your needs?’ type.Star rating is because I find Apple functionality faultless. It can take a while to convert from Microsoft or other operating systems but I quickly realised how well thought out the Max OS is. The stars are the same as for all Apple kit i have bought except the keyboard that goes with the desktop. I don’t get that but only because I like a large keyboard.

What you would expect from Apple at this price
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 August 2022Colour Name: BlueSize Name: 256GBStyle Name: WiFiConfiguration: Without AppleCare+Verified Purchase
I purchased this to replace my sons Apple iPad Air 2 that was still going strong but was getting a little long in the tooth, Apple have really nailed the whole market for having to replace devices regularly to get the best software and support. I generally replace my Apple devices to ensure they are supported for the next few years.The device itself is not that much different from previous ones when it comes to looks or feel when in the hand. It's nice to have a tablet a bit lighter than my past Android tablets. One thing of note is that a lot of modern Andoid tablets compare much more favourably with the iPad in everyway and Apple has lost a lot of the lead it had with regards to its hardware. My brand new Lenovo tablet is easily the iPads equal in most ways like size, weight, etc.Obviously, the major draw for the iPad is the software and it is still more intergrated and user friendly than Android (Although the gap is shrinking). It looks great on the bright and vibrant screen and the performance is as good as ever, I personally have not noticed any real improvement over recent iPads but that can partly be attributed to the smoothness and optimisation of the iPadOS especially now they have seperated it from the phone OS. The only real issues are the quality of the finger print sensor (sometimes it can be very unresponsive) and the new gesture controls following the removal of the home button (They can be confusing and awkward if you are not used to them and they can take a while to get used to. They still lag behind some Android devices since they have refined gestures over a longer period).You pay a big premium for this iPad over the miriad of other options on the market especially if you go for the higher storage models but you know what you are getting and you are guaranteed to get something good and of high quality, so if that appeals to you then it is a easy choice to make.

I don't do that facebooky thing or other social media stuff so can't comment but if does all I ask of it and lots in reserve.  Good camera and easy to edit pictures. Calls are clear and volume good even for my deaf ears. Internet is fast and so is charging. The biggest downside I can see is it's always putting apps into long term sleep that I do occasionally use like YouTube and its always wanting to do updates. Nice though, I'd have another.

Genuinely quite disappointed for a flagship
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2022Size Name: 128GBStyle Name: S22 UltraColour: BlackVerified Purchase
So I've come from a 3.5yr old mate 20pro, and to be honest, I'm a bit disappointed.  OK so.... photos are quite good so that's the bit where there is a leap.  The phone is quite slow switching between apps, it only has 8gb Ram, which is poor considering the 4yr old mate 20 Pro had the same.  It lags when switching between apps quite often for me.  This is big tech firms trimming spec on the flagships to try and keep the price lower and make more money, but you know what.... spending this much on a phone you expect it to be fast and a very good phone.  I found out the 256gb version has more RAM after buying.  Finger print reader isn't perfect, they'd be better off putting it on the side like some others do.The battery does last at least a day, which is positive.  Battery charging can be fast if super charge is enabled else its quite slow.  Its not a bad phone by any means, but I have to say, you can still buy a mate20 Pro for under £400 today, and to be honest I'd say that's a better buy, pound for pound, by far the best phone I ever had....Further update, after 14months the usb-c port is now very sensitive and sometimes the phone doesn't charge.  The issue is the port in the phone rather than the wire too.... always charged on a flat surface, never pulled or tugged.  No point trying to claim warranty, been here before.  Dropping further to 1 star now.

Samsung Galaxy S22Ultra replaced my outdated Samsung Galaxy, hence I was quite familiar with the settings etc. The camera takes much better shots indeed, fingerprint reader is much easier to use. Battery life is very average - depending on how much you use the phone no more than a day for those more active or streaming... Also, an S-pen is part of the phone, which I will hardly use, but there is no opening for ordinary ear plugs, a big minus for me. The company I bought the mobile from, offered a very competitive price indeed. However, be aware that the mobile (at least my one) was imported from Vietnam, without a charger socket, and with instructions in Vietnamese only.  After my repeated complaint, the company refunded me £16.00 for a new charger - thank you. The instructions can be found on internet in English, but some features on the phone remained in Vietnamese - for example the festive days in the calendar. Oh well! I could have returned the phone but I have decided to keep it regardless :-)

            Samsung Galaxy S22Ultra replaced my outdated Samsung Galaxy, hence I was quite familiar with the settings etc. The camera takes much better shots indeed, fingerprint reader is much easier to use. Battery life is very average - depending on how much you use the phone no more than a day for those more active or streaming... Also, an S-pen is part of the phone, which I will hardly use, but there is no opening for ordinary ear plugs, a big minus for me. The company I bought the mobile from, offered a very competitive price indeed. However, be aware that the mobile (at least my one) was imported from Vietnam, without a charger socket, and with instructions in Vietnamese only.  After my repeated complaint, the company refunded me £16.00 for a new charger - thank you. The instructions can be found on internet in English, but some features on the phone remained in Vietnamese - for example the festive days in the calendar. Oh well! I could have returned the phone but I have decided to keep it regardless :-)

Why the hate??
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 April 2022Size Name: 128GBStyle Name: S22 UltraColour: BlackVerified Purchase
As soon as I got my phone on the 24th of April, I installed the big software update. I haven't experienced any of the issues I've read about. The camera is amazing, no lag or freezing, phone signal is great everything is just fantastic, so where does the hate come from? People who had earlier patches it seems. Its unfortunate the phone was released in a state where people were having problems, but it seems they have all been sorted.OK, I upgraded from an S20, and this phone is HUGE. The camera is fantastic, even though YouTube videos have you comparing zoomed in photos with the USA version, but I've taken some fantastic photos with this device and it is amazing.I don't game on phone so can't really comment on that.The screen though, OMG, this screen is amazing. I don't usually watch films on a phone but I started watching Free Guy and ended up watching the entire film. So cool to have a film capable device that has HDR.Speakers are really good for a phone, got this connected to my watch and earbuds with ease.So if you stop obsessing over the tech reviews and just use the phone in real world scenarios, your gonna love this phone.

After a heartbreaking disappointment with the Samsung Z Fold 3. It cost a fortune I was incredibly careful with it and yet the centre screen cracked at the middle seam. Samsung won't help if there is ANY sign of use on your phone. But I bought this as a replacement and I'm glad I did. Its easy to use, great camera, perfect size, send no folding screen to worry about!!

Unbelievable Hold for Wild Styles
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 October 2023Scent Name: UnscentedSize Name: 75 ml (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)Schwarzkopf's got2b Glued Spiking Glue is an absolute game-changer when it comes to hairstyling. This product delivers an unbelievably strong hold that keeps your hair in place for hours on end.**72-Hour Hold:** The claim of up to 72 hours of hold is not an exaggeration. I've put this spiking glue to the test, and it held up through all kinds of conditions, including wind, humidity, and even some light rain. My style stayed intact, no matter what.**Versatile Styling:** While it's perfect for creating spiky styles, this glue is versatile. It's great for all sorts of creative hairstyles, from sleek and edgy to wild and voluminous. You can truly let your imagination run wild.**No Residue:** What I love most is that despite its incredible hold, it doesn't leave any sticky residue or flakiness in your hair. It dries clear and matte, giving your hair a natural look.**Easy Application:** Applying the glue is a breeze. The tube allows for precise control, so you can get the right amount exactly where you want it. A little goes a long way, so one tube lasts quite a while.**Hair-Friendly:** Surprisingly, for a product with such strong hold, it's relatively easy to wash out with regular shampoo. It doesn't damage your hair, and I've had no issues with excessive dryness or breakage.**Confidence Booster:** Knowing that my hairstyle won't budge throughout the day gives me a confidence boost like no other. Whether it's a long day at work, a night out, or a special event, I can trust this glue to keep my hair looking fantastic.**Conclusion:** Schwarzkopf's got2b Glued Spiking Glue is a hairstyling revelation. Its incredible hold, versatility, ease of use, and hair-friendliness make it a 5-star product. If you want your hairstyle to defy gravity and stay perfect for days, this is the glue to get. It's a must-have in my grooming arsenal. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Good for hair, not for eyebrows
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 November 2023Scent Name: UnscentedSize Name: 150 ml (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I bought into the social media hype and picked this up for eyebrows. It’s a lot more affordable than most actual eyebrow products and can be used on my hair anyway, so nothing to lose.Only problem is your eyebrows are literally cemented to your face to the point where it is uncomfortable to raise them. I like laminated brows and brow soap so I’m used to the stuck down brows look but this was just unpleasant, hard and flakey.I have given four stars anyway as it is good for slicking hair back which is it’s intended use, don’t think I can fairly criticise a product because a “hack” on social media didn’t pan out but one to be aware of if you’ve also found yourself here looking for a brow product!

I recently took the leap and upgraded to the Kindle Paperwhite, and I must say it has been an absolute game-changer for my reading experience.Initially, I was hesitant about making the switch, as my previous Kindle served me well. However, the advancements in the Paperwhite have proven to be well worth the upgrade. The display is nothing short of impressive; the high resolution and glare-free screen make reading in various lighting conditions a joy.The added waterproof feature is a fantastic bonus, providing peace of mind for reading by the pool or during relaxing bath times. The increased storage capacity allows me to carry an extensive library wherever I go, eliminating the need to constantly manage my e-book collection.The adjustable warm light is a game-changer for nighttime reading, creating a comfortable and immersive atmosphere without straining my eyes. I appreciate the thoughtful design improvements, such as the flush front display and compact form factor, making the Kindle Paperwhite even more portable and user-friendly.Navigating through books and managing settings is seamless, thanks to the responsive touchscreen and intuitive interface. The battery life has also exceeded my expectations, allowing for extended reading sessions without the need for frequent recharging.In retrospect, I am thrilled with my decision to upgrade to the Kindle Paperwhite. It has elevated my reading experience, and I can confidently say that it's a worthy investment for any avid reader considering a Kindle upgrade. If you're on the fence like I was, I highly recommend making the switch – you won't be disappointed.

This is the Kindle you have been waiting for.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 October 2021Verified Purchase
Christmas has come early.We have been using Kindles since they first came out, and we are a great fan of e-reader.In our opinion this is the e-reader to rule them all.We didn’t upgrade to the last generation, as we were waiting for our old ones to pass on - they didn’t, despite all the abuse we gave them. So we can’t say how much better this is than the last version but compared to earlier ones, the improvement is outstanding.Set up was very easy for both of us. Update the Kindle app for your phone, and enable “Amazon Device Simple Set-up” in the apps setting. Switch on the Kindle, set language and country and select set up from phone. Job done. One Kindle picked up the WiFi password from a stored one on Amazon, while my wife’s one needed the password entered (this took three attempts, and got an odd failed message on the Kindle for the first two times). Pretty much totally painless and took about five minutes each.The display is flawless. Just like a printed book. Even under a magnifying glass the font looks good, and small font display is outstanding. Pinch zoom in/out for font size is very responsive, just slightly shy of active led displays like iPads etc. The backlight is very even and makes reading in the dark a joy.However, the speed improvement of the device it the feature that makes you weep for joy. Searches appear like magic, switching in the library between All and Downloaded no long makes you think the device has crashed. Pressing the home key works without the five minute wait (I exaggerate a little). Even Goodreads actually displays without an hour long wait, and personalised recommendations appear appear like fairy dust.Finally, opening a book, is less than a second - brilliant or what?I can’t testify to battery life, given that it is supposed to be a month, but I don’t doubt it will be anything other than outstanding given the past performance of our old Kindles. Also, joy of joys, gone are the rubbish power connectors that only go in one way. Hurrah for USB-C power connectors, and we can use our Ipad leads and chargers too, when on holiday.So, if you are in any doubt, just get one, it’s great. The only other choice would be if you use audible books and want more storage; but if you just read books, you are never going to fill up 8GB of memory.

I travel a lot for work and other reasons and it can be difficult to lug around books, particularly if you end up not in the mood for the book you’ve brought. Eventually I caved and bought this.From previously owning the first gen Kindle paperwhite a long time ago, the improvements since then are drastic. The automatic warmth tone setting of the backlight is great, as is the waterproofing. The screen is large and fits plenty of text on it and the refreshing technology is much improved, only needing a refresh after 20 or so pages. The device is light and feels good in my hands. The battery life is phenomenal - I read daily, on the train and in bed, and I’ve only charged it twice in the 7 weeks I’ve owned it.I love reading on this and spend a lot more time reading overall than I used to. It’s a really great piece of tech.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2024Colour: BlackSize Name: 16 GBStyle Name: With AdsOffer Type: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase
I've been thinking about upgrading to the 11th gen' Kindle for a while. I've been using my 7th gen' since 2015 and it was still working perfectly, but I'd been drawn in by the waterproofing and slightly bigger screen, so I started having a look and eventually made the decision to treat myself.I'm really glad I did! The screen is crystal clear, great light options, and is nicely responsive through both the library and page turning. The extra 0.5 inch on the screen size makes a surprisingly big difference while still maintaining easy portability, combined with the thin design. The screen being flush with the border is a nice aesthetic as well, and I've not found it result in any accidental page turning as others have reported.I've not tested the waterproof feature yet, but should I accidentally drop it in the bath, I'll update the review!My only gripe is the white Kindle logo text on the front. I far prefer the more subtle indented logo on the 7th gen'.

The screen being flush with the border is a nice aesthetic as well, and I've not found it result in any accidental page turning as others have reported.I've not tested the waterproof feature yet, but should I accidentally drop it in the bath, I'll update the review!My only gripe is the white Kindle logo text on the front. I far prefer the more subtle indented logo on the 7th gen'.

Very pleasantly surprised!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2023Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBConfiguration: with AdsColour Name: BlackStyle Name: Fire HD 10Verified Purchase
Took a bit of a punt on this as a Black Friday deal, and I'm glad I did! My Fire tablet experience previously had been limited to a 2018 model that had started life as a kid's edition, and which I'd taken over when they moved onto bigger at better things. It was limited at best. Adequate video playback, but very slow browser even with one tab, and forget any multi tab use.So what of the new 2023 Fire HD? Let me start by saying I'm not exactly a power user. I want something that looks and sounds good when playing video, and I want a smooth experience when browsing the internet or the Amazon shopping app. And it actually does those things pretty well!Video playback. I was a little underwhelmed with my first streaming attempt - some of Planet Earth III via the BBC iPlayer app. Picture didn't seem as sharp as I'd expected, given that I know iPlayer streams in UHD to compatible devices. Not convinced it's even doing full HD here. Thankfully, better results streaming Picard from Prime Video - very impressed with the display here, even when quite close to my face.The marketing blurb boasts about Dolby Atmos sound. Really not sure about that. I will say that the stereo separation is very effective, despite both speaker ports being along the top edge of the tablet, but audio quality in general is absolutely nowhere near that of my 4 year old iPhone. I'd suggest that anyone looking to be properly immersed in video needs to factor in the cost of some headphones too - either wired or Bluetooth options will work here!How about browsing, which was my biggest bugbear on the five year old Fire 8? Actually pretty good, to a point. I'd say it was fast and smooth via the Silk browser with up to about 4 tabs open. Any more than that and it starts to creak - needing to reload each time you change etc, rather than having a cached version immediately available. Not a deal breaker for me, particularly given the price, but worth highlighting.Storage space seems adequate. 32Gb translates to about 22Gb of useable space, which I believe means about 11 hours of downloaded video although I'm yet to test this. Easily expandable via Micro SD card anyway.A decent version of an Outlook mail app was also a pleasant surprise given Amazon's insistence on continuing to restrict users to its own limited store (I know there are workarounds for this, but don't have the inclination to try). Facebook Messenger app also works fine.Instagram less so - pictures look big and bold and beautiful, but I've had issues with any video content via that site - stutters very badly to the point of being unwatchable.Lots of people complain about the lack of a YouTube app, but I've found YouTube to work perfectly adequately via the browser, with video looking as I'd expected (seamlessly going to full screen) rather than the slightly compressed quality I seemed to get with iPlayer.Battery life seems awesome as well - 5hrs20 of screen on time since my last charge 48 hours earlier, and the battery has gone down to 49%. Very happy with that! Top of class? Who knows - but it's more than adequate for me.Cameras... Meh. 5MP front and rear, but both seem really poor to me. Far more grainy than that resolution should be. Maybe they'd be better outside, or in stronger lighting. But really not a consideration for me - I'll always have a phone within arm's length.As for the lock screen adverts causing such consternation in the reviews? Really can't see the problem. There's one on the lockscreen maybe 1 in 4 times. And I ignore it and unlock. No impact that I've noticed during use - people are really so bothered that they'd pay a tenner to remove ads?! Accept it and move on (with an extra £10 in your pocket).Does this do what I want it to? Yes it does. Do I think it's worth the (I think) £160 full price? Actually yes I do - I think you'd struggle to find a tablet or phone at that price with this capability. And at the Black Friday price of roughly half that, it's an absolute steal.

Great value, good quality device with a couple of gripes
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2024Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBConfiguration: with AdsColour Name: BlackStyle Name: Fire HD 10Verified Purchase
This is my 2nd Fire tablet, the previous one being an 8"" that I had for several years before the battery stopped holding its charge.  When I replaced I decided to upgrade to the 10"" Fire as I had really enjoyed my previous experiences with these devices.Overall I think these tablets are great value for money and do most things that you want from them extremely well.  Setting up could not be easier - you basically take it out of the box and turn it on.  I'm not somebody who wants to sit for hours fiddling with settings so this suits me perfectly.  I switched it on for the first time and my Kindle app is there, my streaming apps are there, my Amazon account is all hooked up to it (that did kind of scare me when I bought the first one, but this time I loved it!) and I literally just switch it on and start using it.  It's even charged up. Perfect for anyone who's not tech savvy or simply can't be bothered with that side of things. These tablets are so good for ereading, internet browsing, games, streaming, linking you up to all your cloud accounts and storage, all on a lovely HD screen with beautiful colour and quality.  The sound quality is perfectly good for streaming music and video and if you have an internet connection you are all set for pretty much most leisure activities you could want to do on here.  With options for bluetooth, you can even hook it up to a bluetooth keyboard and use it as a mini notebook...if you really want to be productive...In the box there is also a charging cable but it's not very long, so if you need to plug that in a little distance away from you while you carry on using it, then you might want to think about getting a longer cable for it.There is so much to love about these tablets, from the versatility to the picture quality.  I just have a couple of little gripes about it:1. The version of Android on an Amazon Fire is not standard and as a result this means that you can't run all apps on it.  The tablet comes with the Amazon App store on it, where you can get compatible apps, but not Google Play store.  If you're sneaky and tech savvy (a stellar combination) then there are ways to install Google Play store but the apps you download may be a bit hit and miss as to whether they work properly on the Fire - some will not work at all. In my opinion, this is the one thing that could make me rethink buying these devices in the future as a device marketed for leisure activities should really support the most common instant messaging apps such as whatsapp.2. It struggles with some graphics packages in terms of dealing with larger dimensions or dpi. This was a bit disappointing, given the beautiful 10"" HD screen that is lovely for drawing on and works well with an active stylus, so you can draw straight onto the screen. I have found that it basically will get so far and perform absolutely fine, but then as the picture builds the lag becomes so great that it becomes impossible to use. Very frustrating, but to be fair, it's not marketed for this use and I probably need to save my pennies up for something that is designed for this purpose.  It's just a note for anyone who might buy one of these hoping to use it for that.Overall I still love Amazon Fire for the convenience, ease of use, the quality of the tablet compared to others in the same price range and the range of stuff I can do with it. I really enjoy using this device.  However, it has lost a star due to the issues I've noted above.

Nice tablet for the price paid
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2024Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBConfiguration: with AdsColour Name: BlackStyle Name: Fire HD 10Verified Purchase
Very nice looking & feel to this latest tablet from Amazon. Works well. Would prefer it to have play store which it can have for those a bit of tech savvy. Was a bargain at half price - that's why I bought it,  it cost £45 LESS than the 8"" version I'd bought for my wife a few weeks previously. One caveat. Get yourself the largest internal storage available. These tablets do not like SD cards. Found the same as other users, the device sometimes ""plays up"" when you add an SD card saying it needs to install it every time it's switched on. There's a lot on the web about this glitch.  So don't buy a 32 gig if you need a 64 gig & rely on an SD card to boost your capacity. Otherwise it's a great tablet, good screen quality, quick & responsive. And slim - pleasingly slim & light.

Its got a really good storyline, the character models/animation are excellent and it has different modes of a type I've never seen before in similar games.  It kept me coming back.

Probably the best Mortal Kombat video game so far.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2024Edition: Mortal Kombat 1 - Standard EditionConfiguration: PS5Verified Purchase
First of  I will start with a major complaint about this video game I had to Waite several days for it to fully install the story mode, it seem to take forever. For anyone under the age of 25 the idea of Mortal Kombat is this you take control of main characters through the story mode and compete against the computer in a story mode which has lots of cut scenes in it as most video games do these days. This video game features some pretty good fighting death moves in it in which Mortal Kombat itself is famous for even since it's humble beginning's on the Sega Megadrive ( anyone remember that over the age of 25) This PlayStation 5 version is a pretty good updated version of the older ones the characters are huge they take up a lot of  the space, I think that is  the way forward now for fighting games like the recent Tekken video game this plays a lot like that one. I have played about a half a hour of this Mortal Kombat video game on the PlayStation 5 it's pretty impressive graphically and gameplay wise.

Nest Learning Thremostat, 3rd Generation fitted to Powermax 185 Boiler
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 November 2016Colour Name: Stainless SteelPattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
Nest is one of those rare products that is impeccable in its design, functionality, quality and ease of use.  All things considered, it is also extremely good value for money as well.  However, like me, you will might only realise that once you have started using Nest.  The positive experience of Nest actually starts on unpacking the product, the quality of the product is evident in every detail.  Even the screws for attaching the product to the wall have a certain quality about them which just is not there in a normal screw.Prior to installing Nest, for years my house has been either too hot or too cold and rarely at just the right temperature.  Now, less than two days after installation, with Nest, I can accurately control the temperature inside my house so that it feels comfortable all the time.I have no hesitation in recommending Nest as a new or replacement thermostat / timer.  It has certainly given my old boiler a new lease of life, which in its last life was simply controlled by a programmable clock and the thermostatic valves on the radiators.  For those interested, the boiler which I fitted Nest to, is the IMI / Range / Baxi / Potterton - Powermax 185 (yes, the boiler was sold and sold again from company to company like a hot potato!).  This type of boiler has a chequered history due to a lack of knowledge amongst most heating engineers on the correct maintenance and repair but despite that, like Nest, I consider it to be a design classic!!  If Nest can fit this old boiler and give it a new lease of life, then it will probably fit any boiler out there.  But do your own research and check the compatibility for yourself.  if you are not confident to fit Nest yourself then it is worthwhile getting a Nest installation professional to fit it for you.The installation process took me approximately 2 hours.  I prepared well by having my boiler installation manual to hand as well as lengths of power cable and a variety of tools such as a cable stripper, drill, tape measure, electrical screwdriver, pencil etc.  I also watched a few YouTube videos on how to install.  One important safety point to remember is to switch off the bolier and isolate it from the mains during installation.Following installation, I can see, at a glance, the actual temperature inside the house and also when the boiler is due to be triggered to run and when it is not.  When I walk past Nest, the built-in motion sensor wakens so that Nest displays the actual temperature and the temperature that the boiler has been set to come on at.  This allows Nest to be setup and adjusted very accurately for each individuals requirements.  Adjustment is made by either making adjustments on the Nest display itself or by using the Nest App on your phone.I have setup Nest to operate to a pre-determined schedule because I have a pretty standard routine, however, Nest has been designed to learn your home life patters and adjusts to suit and save energy when you are out.  You will need to research this a bit yourself to decide if you want to simply set a schedule or let nest learn and react to your movements.When I am away from the house, I can check the Nest App on my phone to see how much the temperature is dropping throughout the day when the house is empty and Nest has been set to a low temperature, so as not to switch the boiler on unnecessarily.  In my case this confirmed that the installation of the loft insulation which was upgraded a few years ago was actually worthwhile!  There being a minimal drop in temperature throughout the day.In its history file, Nest stores the boiler's operation details which allows me to check how long the boiler has had to run for each day to maintain the desired temperatures throughout the day and night.  This will prove to be helpful in adjusting the Nest settings so as to be as energy efficient as possible or for monitoring the benefits of other energy saving upgrades such as the installation of upgraded windows or loft insulation etc.On researching the possibilities of Nest further, it is apparent that the integration of Nest with other household products will limited only by the ingenuity of Nest's designers (which is obviously there in abundance) and the ingenuity and foresight of designers of other products.It was a pleasant surprise to find that Nest was already able to seamlessly integrate with my Logitech Ultimate remote control.  As soon as I realised that this was a possibility, it was done using the Nest App on my phone.I would have never thought that a mere thermostat could be such a joy to use and into the bargain actually provide the very precise boiler control which is necessary to make the living environment as comfortable as possible.  With Nest, the days of turning thermostats up and down to control the temperature or adjusting difficult to set time settings on wall mounted programmers are gone.  Nest is an absolute pleasure to use and helps us to create a very comfortable living environment, which can only be a good thing.There are not many products on the market that I would take the time to review as most are here today and gone tomorrow.  However, Nest is one of those products that stands out and I have no doubt will be here to stay for a very long time.  Nest has clearly been designed and brought to market by skilled and enthusiastic designers and others with a vision who are passionate and determined in their efforts.  Nest has created a product which can actually help to improve our everyday lives in more ways than you could ever imagine that a thermostat could.I did my research before purchasing and watched a few YouTube videos on the installation but I still felt uncertain about it whether Nest would work with my boiler.  Having now bought, installed and used Nest, I would say its a no-brainer!  I hope that this review helps a few people in their research prior to making their purchase.

And with  every one I feel absolutely awful, I wouldn't wish them on anyone..Once an infection has got hold ,the only cure is a very strong course of antiboitics, which my stomach is not too keen on and I then live dreading and awaiting the next infection!Steroid sprays did not help prevent them. I have tried many antibiotics for this condition in the past , but unfortunately only the very strong antibiotics work!! I was desperate and then I came across this product!!  Unfortunately I am now suffering from an awful sinus infection. - But I have to say this is MY FIRST ONE IN A YEAR NOW since using Neilmed Sinus Rinse .My GP wont prescribe the antibiotics till I have suffered for a week to ensure that what I am suffering from is not viral.Understandable I know !! But before I was using Neilmed Sinus Rinse I felt like I was suffering most of the time. NOW A WHOLE YEAR HAS GONE BY WITHOUT AN AWFUL INFECTION or any blinding headaches and I definately put in down to my daily use of this product. ONE INFECTION IN ONE YEAR, COMPARED TO FOUR OF FIVE!!! amazing!!!My thoughts.. prevention is better than cure.  I boil up approx 1500 ml of water and add 6 sachets to this and let it cool .I then poor it into a large plastic bottle and store it in the fridge and this lasts approx 6 days! Every morning I fill up my sinus rinse bottle(without the nasal attatchment as this melts in the microwave) I microwave the solution for approx 40 secs- but every microwave is different so everyone should adjust accordingly - and voila. The solution is ready for use. No waiting for boiled water to cool etc..Its very quick and doesn't impeed on my time.The boiled solution will be preserved for at least a week if kept re frigerated!!  I really do recommend this product to anyone who suffers from sinus problems.It is NOT uncomfortable to use- although I had my misgivings before first using it , but unlike you might think ,it doesnt cause the pain you feel when water goes up your nose when jumping in a pool .It is surprisingly comfortable and much more comfortable and easier to use than a neti pot ( I tried this for a couple of weeks but although it did flush out the nasal cavity, I fould it difficult to use,very messy and uncomfortable on the nose.)  To anyone reading this ,you are  obviously suffering in one way or another with your sinus' and are looking for help and a solution .Well I recommend you give this a try.Trust me it will be money well spent and you will never look back!!!!

It works as it says!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 April 2014Verified Purchase
I believe the product deserves five stars, because it really does what it says it does, and it does it perfectly. The only reason I take away two stars, is the lack of ""better"" warnings if used wrong.THE REASON I BELIEVE IT DESERVES FIVE STARS:This product works as it says and it is indeed working even on people that had problems for years, and nothing else worked. Well, at least it worked for my mother and I am amazed. My mother has had a problem with her nose getting full and her being unable to clear it or breath for many years, and I mean since I can remember her as a kid. She used many solutions to help her, but with the passage of time they became less and less good. Thankfully recently she has been using one that was from Brazil that actually worked, but still it does not compare to Neilmed's solution. Neilmed's solution does not unclog the nose, but more like it prevents it from getting clogged. Nothing can compare to that. She stopped finally grumbling about her nose and by using it once every day or every second day she can breath normally with no problems whatsoever.THE ONLY REASON I GIVE IT MINUS TWO STARS:It is of course because it does not stress it's warning even more. Or more like because it does not stress how severe can be the outcomes of wrong use. It is understandable that if the company would point out how bad the outcomes of wrong use are, less and less people would be trying to use it, but it makes me unhappy to think or my mother getting ear problems I would not have told her how ti use it right and tell her to never use it wrong because the outcomes will be severe. I was glad I first read on here and on the internet how bad the outcome of using it wrong can be and I made sure she understands too. I take away two stars because I feel that her getting ear problems would be so bad that her not having nose problems would not matter!

Not as expensive as you think (XBone Controller + Play and Charge addon makes it about £60 too!)
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2018Colour Name: BlackEdition: Standard EditionVerified Purchase
Can't say manythings negative about this controller. It's fairly priced saying its not ""bulky"" as a X Bone controller since by default you need AA batteries for that specific controller. This is pretty much the same price if you have the play and charge addon for the XBone Controller, giving that a rechargeable battery and cable which Switch Pro Controller comes with by default. Infact because the Switch uses Type-C USB which tend to be more expensive to make at the moment, you are probably getting a slightly better deal. Though compared to the DualShock 4 it could be considered a tiny bit more expensive (we're talking about £8 as of this review).Pros:> Comes with USB Type A to Type C cable (mine was about 1.5m long)> Long battery life> Nice feeling controller all round, infact is one of my favourite controllers> a good D-pad, which compared to the Joycons is very welcomed> larger Face Buttons (compared to Joy-cons)> no weird + and - shaped buttons (compared to Joy-cons)> larger shoulder (L+R) buttons (compared to Joy-cons)> analogue sticks in a way better position, especially for the right side (compared to Joy-cons)> great to use in tabletop and docked modes> makes the use of the ""puppy-dog"" controller grip with the joy-cons a good Player 2 option compared to a limited single Joy-con, or allows for a Player 3 if the Joy-cons are separated> works great as just a Bluetooth controller for other platforms too, like on a PC (With bluetooth dongle/built-in etc), most Phones (with Bluetooth support in apps and on the phone)> no need for AA batteries, has its own built in battery, which is a probable reason why its more expensive to a XBone Controller alonePro-Cons:> Weighty? Some people would see this as a Pro and some might see it as a Con> Cable supplied may be too short for some, especially if you plan to use it's wired (NFC-less) mode when connected to a switch and enabled in Controller Options, though if you are happy using it wirelessly this won't be much of a problem with its large battery life> Yes its is a little pricy at £50-£60 BUT, don't forget it has an NFC reader, and ""HD Rumble"" built in, plus it feels deluxe, and compared to an Xbox One Elite Wireless Controller, which at the time of this review, was £120 (double this!), a DualShock 4 was about £52, and a normal wireless XBone  is £40 so it really isn't too bad.> It can be charged via regular 5V USB outputs but be careful, it isn't Nintendo's fault if your USB charger/device damages the controller, best plug it into your switch if you need it charging via USB, the Switch Adapter works well for this controller too> Could do with a Audio Jack but since not many Switch Games yet support audio chat, and seeing Nintendo seem to plan on using your mobile device (for Splatoon atm) for voice chat anyway via their app, this could be added with a USB-C add on (since it does send data via usb and not just accept charge) in the futureCons:> After 100%'ing Mario Odyssey (999 stars etc) and using the cappy-spin flick motion control with this controller, I noticed over time, the right handle felt minorly twisted out of position, maybe that was more me since I used that move often in game but I could just hand tighten it back on, so be careful flicking it alot> Sadly ZL and ZR on Nintendo Switch (including the Joycons) doesn't seem to support analog triggers, since it is digital so no ""precise"" triggers, havent seen this been much of an issue for me, but if a game requires a light trigger squeeze or a hard one (or a range), there isn't any difference with this controller

The connoisseurs choice
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 September 2018Colour Name: BlackEdition: Standard EditionVerified Purchase
We bought this controller as part of a Prime day package along with a Switch and Mario Odyssey.  It's not something I would ordinarily buy separately, but it represented good value when combined as a package.  I have to say, I'm very pleased we got it!When docked the joycons feel far too small and awkward in my hands (I have very large hands), even when connected to the connecting section.  Whereas the Pro Controller is excellent.  The touch and feel of the controller is very premium.  The buttons have a satisfying level of travel and feel very accurate.  I would say the quality is on par with an Xbox controller, easily superior to a PS controller.  My wife and children also find it ideal to use with the Switch.Battery life on the controller is excellent, we usually leave it plugged in nut even after extended gaming sessions we have never come close to running out.The overall price tag is hefty and I would say it's probably too much, but if you can get it as a discount, or bundled with other stuff I think it starts to represent good value for money.  Also keep in mind that if you want to play any serious co-op locally you are going to need at least one other controller, a joycon each isn't going to cut it.  Getting one of these will satisfy co-op requirements and also offer a superior experience when playing solo.Once Diablo comes out in November the Pro controller will probably get worn out until there's nothing left of it.

A sturdy controller for people more accustomed to Xbox or Playstation controllers
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 October 2023Colour Name: BlackEdition: Standard EditionVerified Purchase
After my Joycon's started to display the dreaded  drifting issue I thought I'd try the 'pro' controller. Apparently these controller don't have the drift issue, only time will tell I suppose.ConstructionThese appear to be very well made and feel sturdy and durable in the hand with a decent weight to it to instil confidence. The smoked black effect allows some internal parts to be visible adding to the visual treat. The charging port feels solid once wired for charging.UsageThe controller feels nice in the hand with light movement on the sticks which have more travel to them than a joycon.  The face buttons (a/b/x/y) all are larger and protrude slightly higher from the controller for more pleasing use in gaming. The shoulder buttons are suitably larger and have reasonable travel to them in use. Overall I think it is much better gaming on this controller compared to the joycons.ValueAt £50 it's about average for a first party controller, time will tell how durable it will be and hopefully it wont develop stick drift.

We go through post its like it's water. We have them everywhere; on matt-painted walls, satin-painted walls, plastic-painted walls, boards, windows, etc. and they always stick everywhere. The colors are nice and pleasant yet still light enough for anything written in them to be seen.Now one thing I do have to say. If you pull your post its out incorrectly they will not stick as well as they should. We pull them sideways and try keep each sticky note as flat as possible.When pulling off the walls it doesn't leave any residue or stain. Even when we loose them they are still sticky after a few weeks. One thing that could be better? Damn the Post It brand is expensive. Worth it? I think they are!

What a beautiful game.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 July 2023Verified Purchase
After downloading the update file and finally starting the game, I was immediately immersed in a world that we've seen on film, or in our imaginations from the books. This is obviously set in a time before either films or book, but you have that feeling that you've been here before. Graphically it is stunning on PS5, load times are so fast. Gameplay is very good with a storyline that I'm still playing through. Even just exploring the world is just as exciting. Overall, I personally love the game and think that a lot of thought and hard effort has gone into this giving the player a good story and characters to interact with.  The basic game came with a haunted house quest download code as well, which I've added to the game but am yet to see. Plenty of hours of entertainment. All round, a lovely game.

Great adventure game
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 November 2023Verified Purchase
Considering I played assassin's creed recently and thought it was terrible I can say that hogwarts aces it for me. Has everything in it and edventure game needs. From missions, to gear, upgrades, spells the works. Nice touch on creating your own character and house. (Or let the hat choose of course) Slitherin all the way for me 🤣. I recommend this game for the adventurous types. Just done 25 hours and plenty more to go. Sometimes just cruise around on the broomstick seeking enemies to battle. With the more spells you get and the ability to upgrade their damage and proximity the fight scenes can vary in so many different ways. Happy with it.

Really good
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2024Verified Purchase
I am enjoying the game. It took me a while to get to grips with it, one of the hardest missions is right at the start but there is loads to do, lots of different side missions and characters to meet. I guess some people play through really fast but I have so many great games I wish I could play for the first time all over, I have enjoyed opening up the map and building up my skills before taking on the big missions. I would definitely recommend.

First DSLR....loving it.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2012Style Name: 18-55mmVR Lens KitVerified Purchase
As a first DSLR i think maybe this Nikon is a no-brainer? Having used a Fuji bridge for a year i decided a DSLR was the obvious next step and having researched the field the Nikon edged the Canon...just.What do i like:* Easy to use...Nikon are really clear with menus/buttons and settings. There is lots to learn but if you are systematic in using the manual it all becomes clear and you can really set the camera up to work for you. The FN button in particular is toggled for example to provide quick ISO settings which really cuts down on menu navigation...i wish it had one more for white balance though. Also the guide mode will likely start most people on the right direction (but it is not full-proof...and why should it be?)* SHOT QUALITY - SHOT QUALITY - SHOT QUALITY....The reason you buy it really and i am really impressed. At first i thought it was no better than my bridge camera (Fuji HS10) but only once you have blown a picture up (say on a 46"" tv screen) do you appreciate the relative merits. It was brought home by the reflection i could see in one specific picture. A portrait shot of my wife with sunglasses was ideal for me to zoom in on a big screen and see the whole of the reflection behind me...including me, the background etc.....all this from a tiny portion of the original shot.....really impressed. Since then ive realised you really have to work for the 'good' shot (thats the fun part of it anyway?) but once you hit it and start to understand why you hit it the camera does the rest and suddenly the results are very impressive. The ease with which you can move focus to get really nice close ups and portraits is my real favorite and makes the activity really pleasurable. The results of the multi-focus system mean mundane shots come alive with lots of foreground detail and a lovely blurred background...and really easy when you've learnt how. The ISO at high levels is super impressive at such a price and i have started to look at my old camera shots and really wish id had this one earlier. In the final analysis it really does what it means to from the start...it teaches you to abandon the auto settings and really begin to understand the fundamentals of photography! Once you've started to get really these detailed shots you just get addicted and you no longer want to just point and shoot!!!* I read before hand that it wasnt classed as particularly 'fast' in either shot reaction and most critically in burst modes (inc multiple single shots) but if you are coming from a bridge camera you will wonder what they all talking about as i find it stunningly quick and very responsive.* Battery time...i have no complaints, it does drain quickly towards the end though so just make sure you get a spare as once its started to go its a very rapid movement towards being non-operable.* Build quality....feels quality.Only things i dont like are the placement of the image review button as i find i turn it on loads when using the view-finder...annoying. Also the focus system is based on contrast so sometimes in ow light you have to cajole it to take a shot. Also factor in other lens and equipment as the 18-55 supplied though flawless is limited and already i am looking at 55-300 and maybe a macro to compliment my kit....money money money!Really love the Nikon D3100 for the shot quality and the ease of use, great learners tool and has me hooked on photography at a new level. Highly recommend....£50 cheaper today that when i bought it as well.

A proper camera and simply brilliant.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 December 2012Style Name: 18-55mmVR Lens KitVerified Purchase
I thought I should add my voice to the chorus of praise for this camera. I learnt the principles of photography back in the 70's when cameras were proper cameras and you had to carry a light-meter and understand the relationship between film & shutter speed, aperture and focal length to get your pictures exactly how you wanted. My trusty old Pentax SV (and later a P30) and selection of lenses served me well until I was reluctantly seduced by the convenience of a digital camera. Digital SLR's were, until recently, well beyond the means of lesser mortals and I had been perfectly happy with my Canon Powershot S3 bridge camera until the shutter finally became permanently stuck. The repair bill here in France was so close to the price of a new, higher spec camera that I decided to up the budget and go for this entry level DSLR offering from Nikon (I assume the price had been heavily discounted due to the release of the D3200), unarguably the best name in still photography for innovation, reliability and build & picture quality since the groundbreaking introduction of the Nikon F in the late 50's.Anyway,  enough of the history lesson. I love this camera and paradoxically, given the stupendous level of technology crammed inside, it takes me right back to those simpler Pentax days. Yes, of course it has a range of fully automatic modes for those point and shoot moments or sudden photo opportunities, but its real strength lies in the incredible level of control you have over the auto-focus (and, when all else fails, proper lens-ring manual focus - how I've missed that!), metering modes and in the simplicity of use of the program & aperture and shutter priority modes. Also, unlike `standard' digital cameras there is none of the annoying lag between pressing the button and the shutter releasing - hoorah!The user interface presented on the bright & clear rear screen is intuitive and every camera option can be controlled by a simply navigated menu system. Mind you, I did spend a whole day working through the book of words and the reference manual on CD but really it is very easy once you've had a bit of a play. Despite not being made of brass like my old SV, the camera has a solid, well balanced feel and the somewhat chunky 18-55mm lens (equivalent to a 35mm 22-82.5mm zoom) sits nicely in the left hand. The auto-focus is rapid and accurate & the results are pin-sharp and distortion & vignette free. Manual focus on close-ups (although the auto mode works perfectly anyway) is easy thanks to the clear, bright viewfinder. I even experimented with the vibration reduction system built into the lens by taking hand-held pictures at slow shutter speeds and, yes, it does make a difference.For those digital camera traditionalists, the `live-view' mode provides a screen-based viewfinder and a load of clever variations on the standard `viewfinder' framing focus options (e.g. face recognition & tracking). This mode also allows movie recording but I haven't experimented much beyond the basic as it isn't something I'm particularly interest in doing.I'm extremely happy with this camera and although another lens would be useful (either the Nikon 55-200mm or the Sigma 70-300mm macro) for wildlife stuff I certainly can't justify the expense and I'm perfectly content with what I have for the time being.There are a couple of essential accessories: A clear filter to protect the front lens element (I bought the Hoya 52mm Pro-1 Digital Protector Screw in Filter which is excellent) and a protection film for the rear screen (I bought the atFoliX FX-Antireflex screen-protection film for Nikon D3100 although on reflection (ha-ha) I should have got the clear equivalent).

Took Some Getting Used To
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 February 2021Verified Purchase
I have had my eye on these since before the PS5 launched but I wasn't quick enough off the mark so missed out on the first lot.Upon them coming back into stock a few days ago I decided to jump in, and seeing that reviews have generally been favourable I was looking forward to them.On the whole I have not been disappointed but upon unboxing them I was slightly surprised. Although they are clearly trying to follow the aesthetic of the PS5 itself, I find them pretty ugly and a bit dorkish in comparison to my Steelseries Arctis 7 headset.Generally they feel well built, if a bit on the plasticky side, but they are comfortable. I've used them for many hours and can confidently say they stay comfortable even for extended hours.Slightly suspect looks aside, performance is where it's at and they definitely do not disappoint. The first game I tried with this headset was Demon's Souls, as I understood that this was designed with the 3D audio in mind. When I first started playing I have to admit to being a bit underwhelmed with the directional audio, but over time as I got more ""tuned in"" to the soundscape I started to notice a lot more sounds, specifically background sounds that may not have stood out through our soundbar. Sound has good depth with enough bass to be punchy, but not overwhelming. Depth is also fantastic, being able to hear multiple levels of sound clearly, and concisely. It is also possible to hear the actual direction of sounds, so in games such as Demon's Souls you know whether an enemy is above, below or to the left or right of you.Performance has been equally as good in other games - I've also tried them with plays on Sackboy's Big Adventure, God of War, Control and Destruction Allstars. In each game the headset performs excellently, always delivering clarity and a good approximation of surround sound in games such as God of War that don't support 3D audio.I haven't used them for voice chat, so I can't comment on how good the microphone is I'm afraid, as I don't use the voice chat feature when gaming online, but I can say that the noise cancelling feature is very good - I can barely hear any background noise at all when using the headphones.I originally bought the headset as a way to play games later on a night to not disturb anyone, but I'm finding that they are now actually my preferred way to play.For £90 they aren't the cheapest set of headphones around, nor are they the most expensive and for the price the sound quality is excellent, very balanced and so far have not heard any distortion in games. If you can get past the slightly ugly appearance and round earcups, which might not not suit everyone, they are a great accompaniment to PS5 games, especially for games that make use of 3D audio!

Headset is beautiful 😍 , it's not too heavy and is very comfortable on the ears. In the box is the following: The headset, the wireless receiver, a USB charging cable, an audio cable if you prefer a wired connection and instructions.The headset has 2 hidden microphones, so no more mics getting the way or having to fold them out the way aswell. The headset seems very well made aswell. It's strong plastic and has an auto adjustable inner rubber strap (see pic) which adjusts to the shape of your head for maximum hold and comfort.The speakers sit on the outside of the ear and when I put them on just to see how they fit, I noticed they reduced alot of the outside noise. This is promising for gaming as when sound is coming through the speakers, you know you won't be interrupted by background noise. These are built for optimal gaming sound. They feel soft and spongy and have a leather style outer material. They are really soft and comfortable on the ears. The headsets are made with 3D audio aswell. If your not sure what this means, to put it simply, say for example your playing a game and your sat on a chair for example and someone walks all the way around you. The speakers will play the sound as it would sound in real life with the footsteps moving around you rather than just blasting it directly into your ears, the sound ""moves"" as it does in real life. The speakers will be immerse you in the game and it allows you to hear everything and what direction it's coming from. It really is brilliant.As for the price £89.99 is really fair for the quality. Alot of people were expecting this to be much higher priced but Sony have done good with the prices of the accessories. It really is worth picking one of these up to go with your amazing new PS5 (I can't wait for mine to arrive, only 1 week to go! 😲)Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope this was helpful to you 🥰

The camera itself is easy to use and user driend, you can however turn it to manual mode and this is where the magic or horror can happen.  It takes awhile to get use to all the manual setting but once u do, the camera gives us more freedom then automatic.  That's not to say that it doesn't work magically in auto mode because it does.Now the consI turn on the airplane mode when I'm not using it because it keeps Bluetooth on and I feel it drains the battery, like all DSLR cameras it can get heavy with the lens on.Yogurt_mint_photography is our Instagram if you wish to view any of the photos I'm talking about.

Very happy with this.  The Auto settings are very good including the auto focus, such that it would be very easy to be lazy and not experiment with manual effects.  The anti-shake on the lens also works well.  I bought this because it's (relatively) easy to use for amateurs like me, but capable of producing professional quality pictures if I take it slow and steady!  The sensor is not full scale but allows an image resolution to achieve that upto small poster size.

The future of DSLR photography, blown away!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 January 2017Style Name: D5600 + AF-P 18-55 VRVerified Purchase
I was fed up with the amount of dust that the sensor of my Nikon D7100 was picking up and the number of times I was having to get it cleaned so was torn between getting shot of all my gear and moving to Canon, upgrading to the D7200 or looking at what was new to market.The D5600 had just been released and on paper looked amazing, so I decided to 'downgrade' to what is classed as a beginners camera.The camera was poorly packed by Amazon in a box that had a bare minimum of those air filled bags around it, so was rattling around inside the box and on opening it up it was obvious that the camera had been unpacked and packed back in the box again at sometime as the battery wasn't even in any plastic packing or where it should have been in the box.  Like other buyers the camera came with a Europe two pin plug charger and no instruction book,  but I took my first photo and loaded the photo into Picasa to view he shutter count and it showed a count of 1, so even though it looked as if the camera had been handled no pics had been taken before I took mine.  I've purchased a genuine Nikon three pin charger plug for £20 and have downloaded a PDF of the manual from the Nikon website to make my purchase complete.Now for the positives, this camera is so light, the lightest SLR I've ever owned, it's lighter than some mobile phones I've owned, well balanced in my hand and had a good sized grip, I'm over 6ft so have very big hands and it doesn't feel like a toy at all.Having owned several Nikon DSLRs the controls and handling is natural, nothing new to get my head around, the LCD is large and clear, and covers lots of angles so I can shoot over crowds.The main selling feature of this camera is Snapbridge, once it's set up on your phone it really does work, Nikon have tried it with adaptors in the past that were hit and miss but they've nailed it this time, I shot with the camera and the photos are on my phone and I can post straight to Instagram, my Instagram followers must wonder what's going on!The 18-55 VR lens with the kit is turning out some crystal clear images and like the camera is amazingly light, focusing is quick and sharp.I've only had the camera for a week, but so far so good, let's hope I don't see the same sensor dust problems that the D7100 suffered with.

Best go pro to date - but it gets WARM!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 August 2023Style Name: SingleVerified Purchase
Great camera, great for action etc.  Used on bikes/various other uses.  Always produced high quality video and stable.  It does get hot though and it eats the batteries - check out the endurance range of batteries if you need more juice (they are made by go pro - not sure why they don't just include these anyway).  Super easy to set up but you do need a smart phone as it uses the go pro app.  You don't need to upload vids to the cloud either.  All in all, as I said - the best go pro so far (2023).

Really happy with it!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2023Style Name: SingleVerified Purchase
So over all, I think it is amazing. So I have previously used a GoPro hero 5 session, which for me was good as I use it for go karting and filming sessions out on track for tik tok, or analysing my racing to see where I improved. However, it didn’t have a screen so I could only look at it whilst I was home on my computer, or had to use my phone ,which wasn’t so reliable to due to connection issues, so I couldn’t get real time feedback from either staff or work out where I think I was going wrong, and could improve myself. With this one, it thankfully does have a screen which I have used both times I’ve gone since using the product. I like how it has a setting which makes it so both screens turn off on their own after 2 minutes.This really saves battery life and I find after filming with it, it goes from a full charge to around 60% after 2 x 15 minute sessions. For days. WhenI’m out longer I’ve also brought a spare battery and charging dock, which is one of the features I love so much about this GoPro, the fact you can change the batteries out rather than having an internal battery which you need to charge. It just makes it so much more versatile and means that now I can use it for however long I want without fear of it dying on me. Could definitely see this being a massive help when I possibly go off to places for karting and do multiple sessions where my current GoPro wouldn’t have coped. The imagine quality is amazing, however I tend to use just the 1080p setting but 5k does work great. I was also slightly skeptical about the imagine stabilisation when I first read about it, not thinking it would be any good, but I’m pleased to say it is! It makes the images so much smoother, and even when I’m either running around, or racing the moving my head about where my GoPros attached, it does an amazing job, especially compared to my Hero 5 session.I haven’t noticed the overheating issue as much, which could be due to the fact of I only run it for a maximum of 15-20 minutes at a time, and only use it on battery power. However, I can’t see this being much of an issue unless you run it as a webcam which this model does support. My main solution would just simply by a specific webcam, or DSLR camera and use that instead, rather than a GoPro.  I would definitely recommend using a 64/128Gb memory card with this, as it does eat through memory. Usually I get about 2 1/2 hours worth of footage with 64Gb which once again isn’t an issue, but I definitely wouldn’t recommend anything smaller, especially if using extra batteries as it is a micro SD card which if you’re anything like me, are aware they’re soooo easily lost, which can cause so much heartbreak. Especially if you have just busted out an amazing lap beating your Pb and want to review the footage when getting home, only to find you lost your SD card.  All in all would definitely recommend to anyone!!!

First GoPro - Honest Review
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 October 2021Style Name: SingleVerified Purchase
- - Delivery - -The delivery was a bit pants. From my understanding, Amazon deliver it to a secondary delivery company and when they plan on delivering it to you, they ‘scan it out’ which sends a notification to Amazon who in turn send you a code for confirmation on delivery. Unfortunately it took 3 attempts and 1 of them they forgot to scan it out so we never had a code. Amazon compensated me with a voucher which was nice of them.- - Storage- -We are using a 128gb micro card which we’ve noticed is a bit temperamental. The card itself is fine but the amount of space the GoPro says it has is inaccurate. I was playing with the camera and deleted all media but the amount of storage space kept going down. This changes with a fresh battery which doesn’t make sense.- -Battery - -You get approx 80 minutes of recording time per battery. It goes down quite quickly when turning it off and on in between films.- - Features - -Time lapse is a dream. It speeds everything up and all you have to do is record. It’s a feature you can experiment with.Photos work well. Not as good as a DSLR but still reasonable quality.The video quality is utterly brilliant. The stabiliser makes it professional movie quality; It’s better than I expected. The sound is very clear too. There are options to change the wide lens from almost fish eye to standard kit lens. The front screen is useful for framing and a great addition.It’s not the easiest to navigate and I am used to DSLR cameras and manual settings. The screen is a bit small or temperamental for my fingers. It’s probably my only real criticism of the screen.

Its a Go pro
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2023Style Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I got this so i could record my daily commute to work and maybe start creating youtube vids again. The camera is easy to use and has an app which allows you to transfer files wirelessly. Its also water proof from the get go so no need for cases to make it more bulky. The picture quality is decent and sound is okay its what youd expect from a Go pro product. My only problem is every time i remove the battery its then asking for the time to be set again which on a tiny screen can be fiddly. Only reason i take battery out is i found leaving it in drains the battery when the camera is turned off. Im guessing thats because its not really off as a quick press of the shoot button and camera turns straight on and starts recording. Apart from that little annoying thing i find this camera to be a great addition to my daily ride and has helped me capture some decent footage and will definitely come in handy in the case of an accident.

It’s an iPhone so what is there to dislike. As you probably guessed I am an Apple fan, so somewhat biased.  But it syncs with my iMac and my iPad Air ( now 6 years old & next for replacement) and everything works smoothly.

A tough call - do I really love it?
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 February 2024Size Name: 128 GBColour: BlackVerified Purchase
A trade up from my trusty iPhone 6S (which was becoming less trusty by the day, suffering from a rapidly depleted battery after very little daily use). First impressions of the iPhone 15 - by comparison, a bland, uninteresting design in an uninspiring choice of colours. I'm getting used to the face recognition, which seems very efficient, even in low light, but I find less universally adopted by some of the apps I use, compared to touch ID. Battery life is excellent - with my conservative use, I find I can go three or four days between charges.  I was impressed by how easy it was to transfer the settings etc. from my old 'phone to the new one - I was up and running in very little time. Probably the most significant improvements over its immediate predecessor are in the area of capturing pictures - something I tend to do with a camera, being a bit old-school (I really should try to get with the programme!). There's no socket for a headphone jack, so I've been obliged to purchase a modestly priced pair of Bluetooth earbuds and I find they work very well with streamed music. Image quality is good - as you'd expect - and the phone has the capacity to do a great deal more than I will ever ask of it. For someone who will make extensive use of its features, the iPhone 15 probably represents great value for money; for me, probably less so.

Be aware that Bluetooth does not work reliably or at all, on these phones. I got mine through the Amazon Apple Store.  Apple is not advertising the fact, of course, and so I’m not sure if this is a software or hardware problem. I have tried a range of Bluetooth periferals that worked fine with older iPhone models.  It won’t even find many of them and when it does say that it is connected, it clearly is not paired.  The only 'solutions' being offered are turning a long list of things off and on in the hope that this will somehow help. It has’nt.The battery seems to need charging more often than I would have anticipated on a new phone and gestures also seem  flaky. My advice would be to try before you buy or skip upgrading.

250 hours plus of wonderful game play - if you want.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2023Platform For Display: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase
So. I did a thing today. I completed TOTK after about 250 hours of adventure, despite breaking my thumb approximately 120 hours into my playing. I had to learn a different way of using the controller without the use of a very painful right thumb. Character building...I've played and finished every 3d-world Zelda game since Ocarina of Time on the N64. I've enjoyed every single one for the familiarity - the look and the music especially -  but also the new aspects of gameplay each one has offered. So, my thoughts... I'll try and avoid spoilers.1. The purchase of a professional controller made the game way more playable than the weeny controls that come on the stock switch controllers. I recommend...2. The fact it was a mostly familiar world was kind of nice. There were lots of moments where it was like 'yep, been here before, i know where I'm going.' But there was enough new and fresh to keep the curiosity high.3. The shrines were probably on balance a bit easier than BOTW but not totally a bad thing.4. At some point you have to say, yep, I've done enough now let's go and pay Mr Ganon a visit. There's way too much to complete!5. The whole autobuild thing is a good idea if not over used. The stuff people have been making is hilarious but you've already rinsed the game if you're at this level. For me, the most adventurous i got with it was the two fan and steering stick hover bike thingy. Was great for getting round the depths and finding all but one light root. I knew where abouts it was (top right of the map) but just ran out of steam... good for getting round the sky too.6. Not a lot of use/point for the horses this time. Travelling better achieved by using shrines, towers and medallions.7. There's a great arc for learning combat skills and resourcefulness. The shrines where you go in with no armour and fight the constructs were great fun i thought. It really showed the value of collecting, fusing and throwing. Very reminiscent of the sword trials in BOTW.8. I left the Lynels and Gleeoks until i was well practised and used to having a thumb out of action! They became great fun. Also showed how valuable collecting all though Keese and Aerocuda eyes and wings had been. Shield parrying and dodging became essential too. With a bit of practice i went from Red to Blue to White to Silver Lynels with no bother. I found wearing decent armor (Soldier armor set plus diamond headpiece from Gerudo town gave great defence (84) plus slight attack up, and then lots of fused weapons from previous kills). Then i collected Fleet lotus seeds for cooking as i found having a high level speed up potion was the best tactic. Allowed me to escape the flame and melee attacks from the Lynels and get 'round the back' and hack away or mount if he kneels. Good fun. Puffshroom use was also fun but probably too easy if done perfectly.9. The end Boss was perfectly manageable with my Lynel killing skills fully honed and a bunch of Keese and Aerocuda eyes and a x5 Lynel bow for assistance.10. The story was decent and quite tragic too. Just enough to pull the heart strings.11. Koroks. Why? I collected fewer than 150. Just enough to expand a band band my weapons stash to a decent level. You only need to hear so many ya ha ha'sAll in all very enjoyable and as usual way more to do than actually needed. But how many single player games out there give you 250+ hours of genuine gameplay (or less if you want to check out early)? Thank you Shigsy once again.

Really superb
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2024Size Name: 256GBStyle Name: Pixel 8 ProColour: PorcelainVerified Purchase
I had a major dither buying this phone. A lot of this was caused by people saying there were issues with the battery life and other negative backchat. Honestly, battery is fine - at the end of a 'normal' day it is still saying 65%, which is fine by me.The cameras are - as everyone says - absolutely superb. I am a commercial photographer of 40 years and the images off this thing are incredible, believe me. I always buy phones with good cameras, but this sets a new standard.I bought my phone as an opened/returned unit from Amazon/Google. Saved £200 - unit is perfect, just a tiny mark on the box but who cares?Updates from Google have rolled in over last two weeks - it just gets better.Glass back is pretty but slippery as a wet fish, so I bought the genuine Google Pixel case in Parchment white to match my phone. Frankly overpriced but really nice in the hand and well made, so like other reviewers of this case have said - just pay the money, you won't regret it.

Was easy to set up from old phone . Awesome screen, better than on my iPhone 15. Camera also looks better than on iPhone 15. I have set Google pixel watch 2 with 256 GB Google pixel 8 pro phone,they both work awesome together. Shame in my area no 5 g ,so I couldn't test it on 5g. Overall is fast ,sleek, very responsive phone. I found a lot features what I can't get on iPhone 15 pro. Is revelant to 10-12 core processor and has 12 GB DDR5 ram. Games do easy. can watch 4 k movies. Performance is spot on ,no issues with apps, lagging or freeze. I tried option set on one hand use, did not make difference when activated it, work same without activating one hand. On iPhone 15 pro face recognition worked better. But screen, camera, video 8 pro fir me looks better. Is definitely phone for photographers and media lovers. My verdict: if you like android phone go for it 8 pro definitely is flagmanDefinitely needs a cover for it as it's slippery.Google pixel starting beat up iPhone 😂

Better than iPhone
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2024Size Name: 128GBStyle Name: Pixel 8 ProColour: ObsidianVerified Purchase
Been having problems with speakers on iPhones since the iPhone XS Max. Every iPhone I've had since then (12 pro & 13 pro max) have all had issues with speakers after owning them for 6 months. A fair few people I know have had the Pixel and said how good they are so decided to get one myself. I've had my Google Pixel 8 pro now for a fair few months and I absolutely love it. I will never go back to iPhone. Don't get me wrong if you've known nothing but iPhone it will take some time to get used to Android but it won't take long. No issues with speakers as of yet and cameras, apps and overall design of the phone are great.

So... I've been an apple user for a very very long time. I love apple. Having said that, I bored of them. I feel as though there as been little REAL innovation. I've been interested in the pixel for a long time. Especially in the camera.I was worried that I couldn't handle Android, that the eco system would be too complex. It's early days, but so far so good.Seems easy to use . Battery seems OK. Not brilliant but no awful.Camera seems awesome.I'll try to update again soon

The phone's hardware is a battery killer, doesn't hold a day of light usage. Not recommended
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2024Size Name: 256GBStyle Name: Pixel 8 ProColour: ObsidianVerified Purchase
I'm convinced that Google gave up on its users, the same ones who were promised 7 years of updates, I don't know why the 7 years at all, I'm thankful if I can complete one year before this battery would be as dead as my grand grandfather. Back in 2016 I bought a Samsung J5 for $175 and I SWEAR TO GOD its battery performance and endurance was much better for at least 6 months even on very heavy usage than this thing I just bought from Google. The 8 pro is my first pixel phone and its battery performance is absolutely hideous, like outstandingly hideous, I can't find the words to describe it, nothing close to a £1000 flagship. I kept thinking that the phone I received must've had a faulty battery, but after some research I found many many complaints online describing the same poor battery performance for the pixel 8 and 8 pro.I have years of battery drainage expertise, I tried everything I knew, every option I could think of:Dark mode always on.Very low brightness all day therefore even adaptive brightness was off.Restricted all apps from background.Turned on battery saver all day.Turned on adaptive charging and adaptive battery.Turned off all vibrations and haptics.No live or moving wallpapers whatsoever.Screen timeout 30 seconds.Turned off any lift-the-phone-screen-goes-on sensors that might consume the battery, I considered them luxury features just to see how far this would go...Switched off (mobile data always active) in developer options as I know data is a major battery killer.Used mobile data for less than 60 minutes a day (if any) while on wifi for the rest of the day.GPS turned off since I bought it, barely used it at all.Turned off face unlock so the camera won't be used every time I turn the screen on.Turned off identify songs nearby so the microphone won't be used all the time.Did everything that was mentioned in the tips for preserving battery life in settings.Sacrificed smooth display (60 hz refresh rate literally all the time).Even took the damn resolution down to the lower option.That said I practically took it back to a mid-range phone, it's barely a smartphone at this point so I waited 2 days and surprisingly enough the battery drainage was the same, like not the slightest improvment that would make me feel guilty while writing this. It's like don't waste your time cause something in there is gonna eat your battery no matter what you do. And I know what many of you might think, factory reset? Nah I did that first thing out of the box: Turn on, install all updates, factory reset and a fresh start.I am so surprised, so frustrated, can't describe how disappointed I am with this battery that feels like it's been used excessively for 2 or 3 years. The discussion forums that I mentioned earlier even said that this drainage problem existed all the way in the pixel 6/6a/6pro/7/7a/7pro and that Google tried with updates but never fully resolved it.And that was the bottom line for me, I'm applying for a return right now. If the company is not taking it seriously then I have a few other flagship brands to choose from, no fancy camera features or smart AI processor would hold me at this point, I didn't pay a £1000 for barely 8 hours of moderate usage from 100 to 10 percent even after all these miserable adjustments I mentioned. Just to be clear when I say 8 hours then I don't mean usage for the whole time, I mean about 5 hours of normal apps (facebook, camera, settings) and 3 hours of no apps running screen off in my pocket and the battery would still drain the same even when not using the phone and that drove me crazy!! A two week test from Google before launching the phone would've been enough to let them know the disaster they're selling people, shame on you googleOther than that, the design is good, both in and out. Everything feels so smooth and slick. If it wasn't for the battery I wouldn't have even considered a return.

Funniest series yet
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2012Verified Purchase
Scrubs box set seasons 1-9 is the complete edition of Scrubs following the switching of networks in the US for the final series.  A previous box set only did seasons 1-8.  Not that you're missing much; the best years of Scrubs were seasons 1-8 with 9 being like the Bond film done by Sony in the 80s, i.e. not that good.Zach Braff is a charming lead in this and ably assisted by his ""brutha from another mutha"", Dr Chris Turk.  I love this show for a few reasons:1. I'm married to a doctor and this series mirrored her real life experience in so many ways.  I also think that anyone embarking on the first big job of your life could relate to their pains.  The whole series was a journey through my 20s that in some way I feel I shared with the characters.2. It's just hilarious!  Ted, the Janitor, Blonde Doctor, JD, Dr Cox, Turk, The Todd...all brilliant.  They gel so well together (just like the Friends actors did).3.  It's touching - as funny as it is, it deals with some difficult subjects and while it makes light of them, it always does so with a bit of dignity.4.  I'll say it again - it's hilarious!Sadly when this series moved networks the show had done all it could but the money grabbers tried to squeeze a final series out of it by introducing a completely unlikeable bunch along with a few of the original cast.  Although I watched it, it was poor compared to all previous series and should never have been done.The DVDs are presented nicely and it's great to watch without annoying adverts or on screen TV pop-ups.  This and Friends are the only two box-sets I'll likely own and re-watch.  I think this will be a classic series that will be shown for years.

Classic sitcom
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 November 2011Verified Purchase
Felt guilty about constantly watching these online and bought it, seeing as the deal is fair. Unfortunately it does include the 9th season, which if you're reading this review I'm sure you know, was terrible. However the 1-8 collection is about £20 more, so you may as well buy this and throw away the last few discs.The show itself is excellent. It stars Zach Braff as J.D and follows his life over eight years as a doctor at Sacred Heart Hospital. The supporting cast and guests stars are, on the whole, fantastic. The relationship between J.D and Dr. Cox, his mentor, is one of the best on television. The show is funny and endearing.The DVD is lacking. Even though I've read numerous times the show was shot in Widescreen, the DVD is presented in old fashioned 4:3 full screen (ie its been cropped down at the sides.) The show was shot with widescreen in mind. Also to fit as many episodes on each disc as possible, they've all been digitally compressed and it shows (all the episodes look noisy and interlaced). The sound quality is fine. I haven't watched many of the extras yet, but the commentary tracks I've listened to have been informative and funny.Even though I've stated the quality of the episodes is poor, unless the show gets a massive resurgence or a Blu-ray release - its probably the best we're going to get therefore I stuck with the 5 star rating. I think the show will age well as the years go by and deserves to be seen.

Humour on hand at all times
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2012Verified Purchase
An impeccable box-set of American comedy, this was the perfect self-bought Christmas present for someone who is such a fan of the show, that I would time my lunch-breaks around sitting in front of the television to catch the daily double bill on E4.As all 9 seasons are now avaiable together, this was exactly what I was after, and at a great price. It is something that you can either watch one episode a day, watch occasionally when you have the time, or sit down and watch a season in one sitting (for those with lots of time on their hands!) The mix of situational comedy and drama leads to sometimes moving, sometimes loving, but mostly side-splittingly hilarious viewing, whilst the involvement with the characters that shows such as Scrubs can create and build over so many seasons allows you to really relate to the cast, come to understand them and empathise with their lives and situations.With all the episodes playable either through episode selection or back to back, and a host of special features, this DVD set is packed to the brim with medical humour, and is a real treat for any fan of such a show. It is even worth owning for anyone who has already seen most of the episodes such as myself - its replayability value is endless!And Turk's dancing never gets old!

It’s Scrubs. If you enjoy Scrubs, you should absolutely buy this, I don’t need to sell the show to you. The only disappointment is the extremely poor presentation of this box. It’s very cheap and flimsy feeling, and none of the DVDs are in proper cases, just cardboard slip cases. Worst of all, half the DVDs had fallen out and spent the journey rolling around in the box. A show as great as this deserves better.

Echo (4th generation) with Philips White Smart Bulb - astonishly good
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 November 2021Verified Purchase
This is a review of the Echo (4th generation) in glacier white colour that came complete with one Philips Hue white smart bulb.I have to admit I have resisted moving into the ""smart"" products market.  I saw little point in them and was happy enough with my various computers, laptop, tablet, smart phones, hi fi, and so on.  What more did I need to complete my life?  According to my daughter, I needed to ""smart-up""!I did read a number of the reviews on this Amazon sales page and I spent time reading the tech reviews online before making a decision.  The fact that Amazon offered a good returns guarantee on this product tipped me over the edge and I ordered one.I was really pleased with the packaging, a lot of effort has gone into that and it immediately warmed me towards the product - and I was surprised that it is quite a weighty object that is not as small as I thought (I really should pay attention to dimensions and check with a tape measure).  A quick look at the brief set-up instructions, find a spot for the Echo, download the appropriate app, plug in, follow the brief and very easy instructions, and all was done.  Barely a few minutes and I was listening to one of my favourite radio stations - although had to rush to turn the volume down because the initial setting was enough to let my neighbours across the green hear me.To say I was amazed is an understatement.  I had assumed all sorts of complications were in store for me but all it took was a few key presses and a spoken command, and I was ready.I listen to various radio stations almost all day (and night), interspersed with playing music from CDs and other sources.  So I was interested to hear what the Echo's two tweeters and woofer could do.  I didn't like the initial audio set-up so after a quick Google search for advice, I went into the Alexa app and decreased the bass a little, increased the middle a little, left the treble as it was and...  to my ears, a tone that I could live with.  Okay, it isn't hi fi quality but then it isn't meant to be, especially at this price, and at lower listening volumes, little hi fi quality can be detected anyway from an average hi fi.Over the week or so I have been using the Echo, I have played various radio stations - oldies, classical, rock, pop, and the Echo handled them all with no issues and the sound quality was far better than I could ever have imagined from such a small unit.  Changing stations is a breeze, simply give the command and a second or two later the new station is playing.  I have also given the command to play different kinds of music and different artists and, again, Echo accomplished this without a problem - mostly coming from the Amazon music library.There is so much more Alexa can do and I am only just exploring a few them - again, nothing difficult there either.  I even set up the Philips bulb in just a few minutes and so Alexa can turn on that lamp, turn it off, dim, brighten, whatever I might need.Dislikes - there has to be some, obviously.  Firstly, the huge price of Philips bulbs which, I assume, are the best quality.  I see no reason for such prices - but then 20 years ago I was paying £11 for an energy saving bulb that soon went down to £1 and now are obsolete because we have LEDs.  Hopefully, the same will apply with Philips bulbs, the prices will come down as more are sold - then perhaps I can buy more.Second dislike, and it is just a personal one - the Echo has various volume settings but they are numbered 1 through to 10.  In an average sized living room for radio listening I find 2 is okay for late night, 3 is too loud if I am also working at my desk, but there is no way of asking Alexa to set the volume to a certain %, so I need to go into my phone app each day to set the volume % that suits me for daytime listening (26-27%).  Believe it or not, there is a noticeable difference between the 27% and the 30% volume that is Alexa's volume 3.  Alternatively, I can fiddle around with the volume buttons on the top of the Echo.  I would, therefore, liked to have seen audio commands for percentages of audio volume rather than up, down, or a number 1 - 10 (if 6 can be heard across the green here, I dread to think what 10 would be like).All that being said, this is a purchase I am delighted with and I will get a lot of use out of.  Already it is my go-to for radio listening and a simple command gets it all working when I turn on the light - yes, I have to manually turn on the living room light until I get a smart bulb with the wattage intensity I want for a main light and then Alexa can turn it on for me at the same time as turning on the radio.  Don't say it - Alexa can almost make a cup of tea - well, it could start the kettle boiling if it is plugged into a smart plug.Should you buy one?  I should say so.  And given the growing number of accessories that can be added, this is a good start to acquiring a smarter home.  I said at the start of this review the fact Amazon offered a good returns guarantee on this product tipped me over the edge to buy one - take note, Amazon, you are not having it back, it's all mine now.

I only had to pair the Bluetooth to my Galaxy phone to listen to my music. I raised the Bass a little but it's very 'punchy' as it comes out of the box.I love the sound. It reacts well to my voice and works great!The only thing I don't like is that Amazon supplies a WHITE power adapter with a white lead but the product is black. It spoils the look.

Larger version of the Echo dot
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 November 2021Verified Purchase
The 4th Generation Red Echo on the right is considerably larger than the black Echo Dot on the left. What are the other differences?  Both these Amazon Echo devices have almost the same functionality and are controlled by the Alexa app, except the larger device has better hearing and sound quality. Whereas the Echo dot cannot hear you if you are not in the room, the larger Echo can!  There are positive and negative consequences to this. The positive thing is the large echo will always hear you and you will not have to repeat yourself when you are on the other side of the room.  The negative thing is that the larger Echo's extremely good hearing causes it to respond to the noises made by the television. It only needs to hear some sound that resembles ""Alexa"" and it will try to reply!The sound quality of the larger Echo is not vastly superior to the smaller Echo Dot, but it is supplied with a more powerful mains adapter and being larger it is capable of playing at an adequate volume in a large room.  I tried it in the bedroom to listen to Classic FM in the mornings, but I found in a small room it is too boomy. It sounds better in the living room. If you only want an Echo for the bedroom, then the Echo Dot is all you need.A feature the larger Echo has is a built-in temperature sensor.

            The 4th Generation Red Echo on the right is considerably larger than the black Echo Dot on the left. What are the other differences?  Both these Amazon Echo devices have almost the same functionality and are controlled by the Alexa app, except the larger device has better hearing and sound quality. Whereas the Echo dot cannot hear you if you are not in the room, the larger Echo can!  There are positive and negative consequences to this. The positive thing is the large echo will always hear you and you will not have to repeat yourself when you are on the other side of the room.  The negative thing is that the larger Echo's extremely good hearing causes it to respond to the noises made by the television. It only needs to hear some sound that resembles ""Alexa"" and it will try to reply!The sound quality of the larger Echo is not vastly superior to the smaller Echo Dot, but it is supplied with a more powerful mains adapter and being larger it is capable of playing at an adequate volume in a large room.  I tried it in the bedroom to listen to Classic FM in the mornings, but I found in a small room it is too boomy. It sounds better in the living room. If you only want an Echo for the bedroom, then the Echo Dot is all you need.A feature the larger Echo has is a built-in temperature sensor. I found the value is consistently two degrees lower compared to the room temperature shown by a thermometer. However, this does not matter since you can allow for this discrepancy.

For my requirements; All Round Perfection
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2024Colour Name: Glacier WhiteStyle Name: Device onlyVerified Purchase
Having a number of Amazon Alexa devices around the home the Echo Studio has been on my radar for a long time and I have read the Spec and reviews too many times to count and on each occasion a review of one type or another plus the price has stopped me from purchasing.Until now when I decided it was time to trial them for myself rather than be swayed by others and how pleased I am with my decision.With my own experience of buying other Amazon Alexa devices and paired them for listening to music I was never going to buy just one Echo Studio so bit the bullet and decided to buy a pair. Amazon delivered the next day so there was no anxious waiting around for them to arrive.They came extremely well packaged, not the shipping packing - this was actually quite poor considering the value and type of the product, the actual speakers came double boxed and in Amazon cloth bags to help lift them out as they are weighty. They have a real quality feel and look. I do agree with other reviews that the power cable needs updating but that’s my only criticism about the overall look. Before buying I compared the other speakers available and these appeal to me more than anything else out there regardless of price.Unboxed and plugged in, they paired seamlessly with our network and Amazon account and connection took less than 5 minutes including an update they self performed. The sound quality is superb and we haven’t even pushed them over 50% as they are loud. A quick look at the Alexa app and a tweak on the EQ to suit my personal treble & bass choice and to pair them, not just together but with our Amazon fire stick and we sat back just to enjoy ‘all round perfection’ whilst watching tv via the fire stick.We moved onto streaming some music tracks via Amazon Prime and Apple Music and were pleasantly surprised by the rich tones and extremely clear sound quality.I reached out to Amazon for a suggestion re a good make of Optical cables and a Optical powered splitter in prep to link our tv to the Echo Optical input/s (you need two optical cables as a single cable will not provide sound to both speakers hence the required splitter too). Amazon suggested to purchase ‘any good quality cables and a powered splitter is recommended if the total cable length between the TV and both Echo Studios is more than 10 feet’. I only wanted to purchase a powered splitter anyway and found a nice triple output version with an additional 0.5mtr cable and a 5v USB power cable included with two 1.5 mtr Optical cables ordered too I would be all set to go when they arrived. I was apprehensive with this set up as I had read so many reviews whereupon others had experienced problems setting up this type of Optical connection.My purchases arrived today and within 5 minutes everything was set up. I had already changed the tv output to optical because I had set up the optical tv out to a LG Sound bar (which to be honest wasn’t good and the sound lag was awful) so having now set up the Echo Studios with the tv I could wait to see what we faced?I couldnt be more happy I was blown away with the sound quality. All the problems I had read about that other people say they experienced was not what I was now experiencing. I kept the tv running and just asked Alexa to play music and it switched perfectly and when that song finished I simply said ‘Alexa stop music’ and it switched back to the tv with no problem. It’s worth pointing out that the tv remote stops working the sound up/down/mute but you simply just voice control it and there is no voice lag between the tv picture and the Echo speakers unlike when using the sound bar. With the 3rd output on the splitter I can even plug in a set of headphones whereas I couldn’t do that prior as I had no headphone output via the tv. Cost of the 2 x cables £19.98 and the splitter £15.99 and worth every penny for the sound quality we are now getting via the Echo set up. And to top it all off the Echo Studios still work perfectly when asking Alexa to do anything (obviously the tv sound stops whilst this takes place but thereafter it simply switches back to tv sound.I have no cons what so ever my only two regrets are not buying during Black Friday to save a few bob and for not buying before now.The pros are quality sound now from the tv and streaming music and the two Echos are connecting to my iPad & Samsung phone to play music perfectly via Bluetooth.So if you are in doubt about trying & buying just do it and see for yourself if they fit the bill for your needs. There’s a lot of help out there if you get stuck with set up or what accessories work and worse case scenario if you don’t get on with them you have time to simply return them.I’m glad I took the gamble to try them for myself and I now have all round sound perfection from these great Echo Studio Speakers.

Excellent phone for me
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 October 2022Colour: CharcoalVerified Purchase
For about 4 years I have bought unlocked chinese phones. They are cheap and very well speced on paper. But after a short while battery life deteriorates significantly. Mysterious apps seem to appear on your phone (despite my virus protection package) and some western apps do not work. It was getting so bad that I could not rely on my phone to hold its charge to show my google wallet football ticket for a 3 pm kick off. So I decided to pay a bit more and go for the pixel. I don't regret it. Battery life is long and charge time is quick. All my apps and data came across without a glich. Functionality is good i.e. everything I have tried works. Ring Doorbell, Garnin Running app, Bluetooth headphones, Wallet etc etc.Picks up a weak signal which my other phones didn't.Maybe photos are important to you. To be frank I can't tell the difference between one camera of the other in this regard. So the camera function is fine for me.I did have a problem with Chrome misbehaving. Most manufacturers are hopeless at support. I found Google's solution from their web page. It took less than 2 mintes to search, identify and resolve the issue.I'm a 72 year old dinosaur in case any of you reading this are of a similar age.

Massive upgrade for me
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2024Colour: CharcoalVerified Purchase
Though now an older model and I bought refurbished (you would hardly know not new), this seems like a fantastic phone compared to my older Sharp one.Almost every aspect is better the main one for me is quickly locking on wifi for wifi calling as we are in a no coverage area locally. It seems better at finding network coverage too so important improvements there.Battery life was often panned in earlier reviews but in standby with modest use it will easily last two days and probably most of three days.Camera is not something I was too bothered about but has mostly been surprisingly good for stills and video so I am using it far more than on any previous phone which all too often were rather disappointing.Now on Android 14 so a few apps which wouldn't run on previous phone which might have been on 8 are working. Longer term an under-rated advantage of a google phone is likely to be much better support and updates for  years to come.

Good but not perfect
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 July 2023Colour: CharcoalVerified Purchase
Pros:Amazing phone for the money.  Plays all the latest games.  Having Google integrated with it, just makes it easier.  Android updates for a few years too unlike some other brands that get outdated in two years.Cons:Battery life.  Something's draining the battery.  It's a common fault with most of the pixel line.  I'm charging the phone twice a day.  My old OnePlus 5 used to last over a day on one charge.  Also charging speed is slow compared to my old phone that had the fast charge.The camera.  It takes nice HDR images that look good for landscape photography, holiday snaps etc.  But it overprocesses shots that you want to just look normal.  Example would be, when I photograph my dog.  She looks weird and totally unnatural.  I have to load up the raw photo and use that, but even that has something done to it.  Again my old OnePlus 5 took more natural photos with true looking colours.

Great alternative to Samsung and Iphone at a good price.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2023Colour: CharcoalVerified Purchase
Research has paid off! - As with most phones, a review depends on exactly what is important to the user - ease of use and camera quality was important to myself. This is by far the best phone that I have purchased. The phone is extremely easy to set-up and use. Apps download super-quick, with the speed of every action being fast and accurate. The camera is by far the best, with picture quality being extremely clear and sharp. I haven't had any issues with the fingerprint sensor, which was a concern after reading reviews, this is with a screen protector in place. Not having a headphone socket isn't an issue, as bluetooth is preferable for myself. The phone did come with a charging cable and plug.  I didn't particularly like Samsung and did not want to become 'all things Iphone'. This is a great alternative. I couldn't be happier with the choice I have made, especially for the price. Would recommend.

My granddaughter pointed this plane out at £90:00z.plus pilot. A few days after because believe you me I thought I would give the company a jolly well piece of my mind.As I had seen on the barbie website the plane waas £55 a massive difference. It’s was the exact same size it was the exact. It took me quite awhile to work out why I was paying this . Stupid  price difference being buy  Was going to return abd buy the  one at )55 then at last I found out what the question of the difference was. Only the one at £90 came with provided pilot doll. I looked everywhere and I could not find the pilot bring sold separately. So to get the pilot. So in effect you are actually paying £35 for the pilot. My main concern was my granddaughter wanted the pilot… Then I had no choice but to pay £90. Now like someone else pointed out she could have got it af a lot cheaper had I waited until Black Friday. I didn’t even think about it at the time. I also noticed it has come down in price only by £8 I just couldn’t be bothered returning and buying again seemed like a lot of  Messing  for 8 quid most of all my granddaughters was absolutely exited and loved the plane. So from that point of view it was to be £90 well spent. She had lot of other presents. Although I will say this.  It’s not just the company that make barbie products. I know many years ago it was manufactured by Mattel toys. At £90 it’s well over priced as a lot of the barbie products are. Now in this climate at present have yoh ever though od reducing  the prices and selling more. But most of all making a little girls wish to come true. I could bit help thar it’s how in my opinion shoukd be done. With everything. Hypothetically if you sold a  hunfread a Sejm at £90 would it not work out more profitable uo selk 500 a week at £55 with the pilot. That actually makes more sence to me. My husband abd I only live off his military pension abd his state pension to live off. We are not thd only one compfany that could do this. As I have explained how it’s a state pension and military pension we actually live of. So with our current utility bill is outlandish. I heart goes out to the parents with a couple of girls who genuinely can not afford this. I just wish one company like Mattel coould or would show yes you can kerp your your profits up but noting  grand like thodd to hiybinc  just someone give all the little  girlis accessibgvakk the vxsc

Connect it between your devices, and it typically works without the need for additional drivers
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 October 2023Size Name: 6 Foot/1.83 mStyle Name: 1-PackVerified Purchase
The Good:Reliable Connection: Many customers have found this cable to provide a reliable and stable connection between their devices. It's often used to connect computers or laptops with DisplayPort outputs to HDMI-equipped monitors, TVs, or projectors.High-Quality Build: The gold-plated connectors are a nice touch. They not only provide a secure fit but also enhance the durability of the cable, making it resistant to corrosion and wear.Plug and Play: Most users appreciate that this cable is ""plug and play."" You simply connect it between your devices, and it typically works without the need for additional drivers or configurations.Affordability: Amazon Basics products are known for their affordability, and this cable is no exception. It often provides good value for the price, especially when compared to cables from other brands.Multiple Applications: Beyond computer setups, customers have used this cable for a variety of purposes, including connecting gaming consoles, Blu-ray players, and other devices to HDMI displays.The Bad:No Audio Support (in some cases): Some users have reported that this cable didn't transmit audio when connected from their computer's DisplayPort to an HDMI display. This could be due to specific device configurations or settings.Length Limitations: While 1.8 meters is suitable for many setups, it might be too short for more extensive or complex arrangements. Users with larger rooms or specific placement requirements might need longer cables.Not for All Devices: DisplayPort and HDMI are common standards, but it's essential to ensure that your devices support these connections. Some older or specialized devices might not be compatible.In summary, the Amazon Basics DisplayPort to HDMI cable with gold-plated connectors (1.8 meters) is generally well-received for its reliability, build quality, and affordability. It's a straightforward solution for connecting DisplayPort-enabled devices to HDMI displays. However, users should be aware of potential audio compatibility issues and consider the cable length that suits their needs.

DisplayPort to HDMI ONLy
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 April 2023Size Name: 7.6 mStyle Name: 1-PackVerified Purchase
This is perfect for my use case. However, there are some things to look out for if you want to buy this product.To start with, this cable cannot handle 4k 60hz as advertised. This may be because the cable connectors are DP 2.0 or HDMI 1.0. This isn't a problem because I'm only outputting from a GTX 1660 super, which can only be 1080p 60fps reliably. But if you are looking for 4K, I recommend using another cable.Another thing to mention is that the cable can only do DisplayPort to HDMI and not HDMI to display port as it is not an active cable. I don't believe the product states it can work both ways, but it doesn't say it can't either. Again, lucky for me, I'm displaying from a display port to an HDMI port, so it's all good.The cable is a particularly good build and super sturdy so you can be tough on this thing, and it won't break. I had to cable manage this behind a wardrobe and pull it through, which would've broken most cables, but this one worked perfectly afterwards.Overall a good product, the listing could just be a bit more accurate!

An endearing legacy to the wonderful world that JK Rowling created
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2024Platform: PlayStation 5Edition: Amazon ExclusiveVerified Purchase
I thoroughly enjoyed this game; the story builds upon the wonderful world that the amazing JK Rowling created.  She inspired millions of young people to read her stories, to lose themseleves in the stunning visuals of the film adaptations, and through Hogwarts Legacy, create their own character and live their story in the wizarding world.The character creation at the start is a strong positive for the game; you care more for the character you created.The dialogue choices are fun to play out, and whilst there is seemingly little difference in the final outcome, I like how you can shape the personality of your character and prompt different reactions.The story arc is very good, and the spells are fun to learn.  A minor issue is the lack of Quidditch, but broom racing (and the controls) are well designed.  Learning the dark arts and having the choice of learning the Unforgivable curses is also welcomed, but a dark character arc option would be a welcome DLC or sequel.The graphics (PS5) and audio are brilliant and do a great job of recreating the film aesthetic.No spoiler here but choosing Hufflepuff results in a unique quest at a location not available to other houses.  I saw it online... I played as a Ravenclaw but with Slytherin tendencies!Enjoy!

What a lovely game
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2023Platform: PlayStation 5Edition: Amazon ExclusiveVerified Purchase
Im a 50 year old and am really enjoying Hogwarts Legacy on the PS5. Its a RPG game set in the wizarding world with a great story to follow your adventures. Gameplay is a mix of puzzles, unlocking items, learning spells, learning to fly on your broom and exploring a huge world around Hogwarts. Graphics are great and storyline engaging.Its not an easy game though, the combat is quite challenging (defense is more important than attack i find) so dont expect an easy walkthrough (unless you select easy) and some of the puzzles are quite difficult as well. You need to think through all the magic at your fingertips to work out how to solve.Its not a cheap game but I am already 12 hours in and hardly scratched the surface. Gameplay is varied and the world huge and interesting. Characters are engaging.If you have any interest in the Harry Potter world you will love this game. My 10 year old is playing his own way through the game as well and is progressing about the same speed as me (he uses a different approach to defense in the combat scenes which is interesting as well. More than one approach works). So its good for young and old. This is the game i got the PS5 for and it doesnt dissapoint. I suspect there is 50hours + of game play in this.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 July 2023Platform: PlayStation 5Edition: Amazon ExclusiveVerified Purchase
Not much more to add, the reviews on here speak for themselves. Great experience and would highly recommend.I’m 30+ hours in, completed the main story and probably got another 30 hours or so yet to platinum. Definitely one of the better games in a while. I’m NOT a big Harry Potter fan and have only seen a couple of the movies, but I love RPG’s and open world games so wanted to try this out. I’ve got over 150 hours in AC Valhalla and I’d say I am probably enjoying this more. Feels much less of a grind and a new experience.Huge map, combat is fresh, attention to detail and graphics are amazing. Plenty to do. Story was decent and the character customisation is up there with other AAA RPG’s.Yes, there are some elements that feel repetitive after a while but that is expected when you’re north of 30 hours into a game. Name one game that doesn’t.If you’re a fan of RPG’s just buy this, you won’t be disappointed.

Good game!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2023Platform: PlayStation 5Edition: Amazon ExclusiveVerified Purchase
As a long-time Harry Potter fan I was super excited to play this game as soon as I got a PS5. I usually enjoy story games so this was perfect! The disc version was great, it came with an exclusive Haunted Hogsmeade side quest as well as an Amazon exclusive, which is the Astronomer's hat. It looked great in the image but on my character, it didn't look as appealing :( The overall gameplay is great and the mechanics are similar to Dark Souls, which is a game I'm familiar with so getting used to the gameplay was super easy! The main quest was really interesting but some parts felt quite tedious and arduous, especially when it came to the puzzles. If puzzles are something you enjoy then no need to worry! Some side quests were more interesting than others so I ended up giving up the game and left most of the side quests. A lot of them were focused on gameplay outside of Hogwarts, which didn't appeal to me as it didn't feel like I was playing as a Hogwarts student but rather a random character. A lot of the beginning story is based in Hogwarts castle, but as the story proceeds, the story is focused less on being a student and more on being a 'chosen one'. As a Harry Potter fan, I would've preferred more focus on being a student rather than the combat, but I guess the game would be a bit lacklustre in terms of gameplay. One thing I enjoyed was the ability to 'transmog' my gear to have the appearances I preferred, while still using the most powerful ones. Overall, I did enjoy the game and put around 20 hours into it before I gave up, but it was enough time to finish the main story and side quests I enjoyed!

I bought this for my son as I read the great reviews however turns out my son had already bought it so I had to return it which was very easy and refund was issued as soon it was scanned at the post office. My son (15) said it is a very good game though.

Pros - Good graphics  -  Game doesn't too long to finish (a lot of side quests are optional.)  -  Awesome combat system.  -  Good storyline  -  Love the appearance changing systemCons - Flying mechanics gets taking used to (but not awful)  -  Voice acting is a bit weird 😅 but doesn't ruin the game whatsoever!

Amazing game!

So much to write. The story is amazing, the graphics are fantastic, it's one of those games you just don't want to put down. I'd highly recommend this for anyone! Whether you're a Potter fan or not, it's suitable for everyone and it's interesting even if you're only watching your partner play it for hours on end.

Still An Amazing Buy In 2016
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 November 2016Verified Purchase
SUMMARYNow, out of all of the things that I have reviewed so far, none of them has been as prominent and as 'ancient' as the Blue Yeti. Yet again and again, it is praised as one of the best microphones for around £100.EXPERIENCEThe microphone has 4 recording modes: Stereo, Cardioid, Bidirectional, and omnidirectional microphone for recording. Stereo records audio from every direction, which is good for picking up audio from all around the room, and with that, picks up unwanted audio. Cardioid is good for for podcasts and voiceovers since it picks up audio only in front of the microphone. Bidirectional records audio from in front and behind the microphone. Suitable for interviews. Now, I'm sure you know of the Blue Yeti, but is it still worth buying as a starter microphone to YouTube for example? Simple answer, yes. The reason to this is because it is an established brand. Meaning that it will stay that way for time to come. At £99, this microphone still produces crisp audio even for today's standards.The microphone comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you can monitor your sound straight from the microphone with zero lag. At the front of the microphone there is a mute switch, and volume control for the monitors. Next to the headphone jack, you will find a mini USB port for powering the Blue yeti. The microphone is very well built, and is predominantly made of premium materials like aluminium.However, purchasing a pop filter of any sort will help the microphone pick up less background noise, so it is highly suggested that you purchase that too with the microphone.SOUNDNow, the sound it records is fantastic for the price. As said before, it produces crisp, clear audio, and when paired with something like Audacity, you will get some fantastic results. Out of the box, however, the microphone does pick up slightly too much background noise for my liking. Although, why you may have never seen many complain about that is because that can easily be edited out in a program like audacity very easily.The four recording modes and customisation I found to be very useful. I liked being able to easily switch recording modes depending on the situation. I found myself mostly using Cardioid, but obviously your preferences vary.PROS AND CONSProsAmazing sound for the priceWell builtGood customisation of soundConsToo much background soundFINAL VERDICTIn the end, I’ve found the Blue Yeti to be an excellent USB microphone for those who are serious about recording quality audio from their PC or Mac computer. The build quality, features, and performance are exceptional for the sub-£100 price tag and provide great value on the . If you’re looking to capture higher audio resolutions or want to use an XLR output then you’ll need to spend the extra money on Blue’s Yeti Pro, but for most consumers the standard Yeti model will be more than enough. I am satisfied with my purchase of the Blue Yeti and I would recommend it to any potential buyers as it is likely the best candidate at this price-point.

My Yeti Has Helped Me Make 50+ Youtube Video's, Has over 1000+Hours of LiveShows & is Still Going Strong!!!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2016Verified Purchase
By far the best mic I've owned & used up till now.As a YouTuber & Livestreamer on Twitch i'm always looking to improve the quality of my recordings & videos as best as I can but also be on a budget.For me the next step was to find a decent mic to help with my audio & the Blue Yeti has met all of my needs perfectly.I had tried other mics in the past before my Yeti but this mic exceeds all of them & for not a lot of money either.The mic itself is great & the build quality is of a really high standard, its pretty much ready to go straight out the box.One thing I really liked is that you have a few settings on the mic itself so it can capture sound from different directions or help block surrounding sounds by the twist of a switch on the back.The settings are...STEREO. Front/360 sound capture. best for vocals, choirs & instruments.CARDIOID. Forward only sound, this is what I use. best for podcasts, voiceovers, solo vocals & solo instruments. also helps block surrounding noise that isn't coming directly from the front of the micOMNIDIRECTIONAL. Full 360 sound capture. best for conference calls, field recording & live events.BIDIRECTIONAL. front & back sound capture, best for interviews, duel podcasts & vocal duets.The mic also comes with a very strong & sturdy desktop stand but for me personally I decided to go with a actual mic stand so I can adjust height & move it around.Its really easy to swap over if you want to do the same, you just need to undo the two screws on the side, then the mic just screws on to the stand or boom arm in the thread that's on the bottom of the Yeti, also the stand I bought was just a normal generic mic stand from a music shop, so no special size threads or anything stupid like that.I bought my Yeti mic at the end of 2014 so as of now I've been using it for nearly two years & in that time I've made around 50+ videos with voiceovers for my YouTube channel & done over 1000+ hours of livestreaming with the Yeti to my Twitch channel, most of my live shows can last for anything up to 12hours each so I really put my Yeti to the test every weekend so i know its good quality & will last you a long time.Even now almost two years after my purchase it shows no signs of wear or lost any performance in sound quality.Very happy with my purchase, would buy again & recommend to others.

The Blue Yeti USB Microphone is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-quality microphone for PC, Mac, gaming, recording, streaming, podcasting, studio, or conference calls. It offers crystal clear audio quality and a variety of polar patterns for flexibility in capturing sound. The build quality is also impressive and feels very durable. The microphone is also easy to use, with a simple plug-and-play setup and a mute button and volume dial on the front of the microphone.Additionally, the Blue Yeti is a versatile microphone that can be used for a variety of applications, including podcasting, streaming, recording music and voiceovers, and even video conferencing. The microphone stand is also adjustable, allowing you to position it at the perfect angle for your needs.Overall, I highly recommend the Blue Yeti USB Microphone for anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile microphone that is easy to use and delivers excellent sound quality. I give it 5 out of 5 stars.

We brought and ninja smoker for when we go camping with electric hook up, it is an excellent piece of kit which we used for breakfasts and dinners. I love that it has different settings and also tells you when to flip items inside and takes that into consideration for your cooking times. The smoker feature is an excellent addition and we have had a great experience experimenting with smoked chickens. We were really impressed as they came out really juicy, with a tasty crispy skin. The smoker is really easy to clean with removable plates and the handles to carry it are also really useful. I was really surprised to see a lot of people using it whilst we were away and look forward to using it again this year. It is a smart piece of kit that looks really stylish and easy to store in a good sized cupboard, it is really easy to use in comparison to our cadac.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I’ve wanted an air fryer forever so when Ninja announced they were releasing this, I asked them to take my money.It may be too ambitious a gadget for a first-timer, but I think I’m a little overwhelmed, and there are definitely some issues here and there. But, look, if you want a tl;dr - it’s amazing.I will say, we’ve only used the air fryer function so far but next is the Smoker function and I’ll update this as and when we use the other functions (there are 7, including dehydrate, which is pretty cool.)Okay, from the very beginning: it arrives in a huge box; it’s much bigger than it looks in the photos. It comes with some minor assembly needed - you just need to use the wee Alan (Allen?) key to attach the two handles on both sides. The handles aren’t quite flush, which is a bit lame. It just makes it feel like the quality isn’t quite there.You’ll also need to slide the grease tray into the back slot at the very bottom - this will catch all the run-off oil and guck.A really annoying thing is the On/Off button - it is in the stupidest place imaginable: under the unit itself, behind the right leg. It’s all but impossible to get to without flipping the whole unit upside down. It’s also ever so slightly sticky, so we weren’t sure if we had actually turned the unit on.Because that was another issue. When we turned everything on, nothing happened. We tried different plug sockets; we hit the Start button again; we turned it off and on again... nothin’. Husband then hit the Reset button on the actual plug and it came on. I don’t know whether we’re going to have to do that every time - we’ll just have to see. EDIT: I have an update with this, I’ll add it at the bottom.Another issue is the recipe book and instructions provided. We wanted to make chicken wings for our first attempt and the recipe book is covered in photos of them so we assumed the recipe book would include air fried chicken wings. It does not. It’s daft. We had to look at a YouTube video for timings.For the record, we set it to 200 degrees, let it pre-heat, and then let them cook for 20 minutes.It beeps to let you know when it’s pre-heated, by the way, so there’s very little faff involved there. At the 10 minute point, it told us to flip the food over, which we dutifully did. They looked yummy but a bit anaemic so I had my doubts, but we let them cook for the full 20 minutes. I took a photo of the end results - they are lovely chicken wings. I prefer them a little crispier so I guess we’re going to have to experiment with timings and temperatures but they’re lovely.The instructions say to only use it outdoors but we used it in the kitchen with the windows and doors open and the fan going - the manual says it can put out carbon monoxide so I think being safe with this thing is really important.I do have one major complaint, though: I registered the unit with Ninja and almost straight away started getting scammy phishing emails - I have to think one precipitated the other because most of the subject titles mention Ninja and the timing is just too strange not to be connected. So either Ninja sold my email address or their customer data was scraped - I don’t know enough about this stuff to know for sure but it’s worth bearing in mind.It’s all really easy to clean, by the way. We put the chicken wings on the grill tray instead of in the air fryer basket, and it’s very non-stick. Then we just gave a wipe down to the rest of it to remove any oil or residue.So there you have it.Oh! You get two packs of wood pellets for the Smoker (they go in the the little mail slot on the left side) and Ninja say you can ONLY use the Ninja wood pellets. I’ve been looking into that a bit and it’s nonsense. You can use any food-safe wood pellets with the Woodfire Grill.So, yes, I don’t think I’m as impressed as I thought I’d be... the slight build quality issues and the stupid On button and the loudness of it as it’s cooking the food, and the expense, and the fact that it didn’t start first time and being inundated with annoying emails from phishers... I don’t know. To be honest, I don’t think I would buy it again, especially at full price. But maybe as we get to know it better and use the Smoker and Grill functions this summer it will really come into its own.I’ll definitely update this as we use it more so you can get a better idea of it all before spending that much cash on something that might be a bit disappointing.EDIT: so we used it again and, once again, the unit didn’t switch on until we hit the Reset button again. That just doesn’t sit right with me, somehow, so we called Ninja to ask if that’s a fault. After about half an hour of answering questions, we were told that if you unplug the unit from the wall, next time you use it you’ll need to press Reset; if you leave it plugged in and just turn it off on the unit itself, however, it will store your settings and turn on normally.Thing is, I don’t think it stores any settings (?) so I honestly don’t know if we were being fibbed to there. But there you have it. No clarity whatsoever!

First the honesty....my wife looked at the vids on you tube...thought it would be good and with a degree of indifference I ordered one .Secondly it's worth noting I have owned all sorts of bbqs and a dedicated smoker in the past and I genuinely did not have high hopes for it.Nothing prepared us for the results or it's capacity.1.65kg of smoked pulled pork in 4 hrs.24  chicken wings smoked in 20 minsFlat bread pizzas coming out every 3 -4 mins .Everything cooked wow....Yes really.But what sort of construction is it?....well for a start its deceptivly heavy and well built which for me comparing prices against a new bbq  was a surprise.This is a machine that can be used indoors but only on smoker mode under exceptionally good extraction ( normally best outside) it's vertatile it will grill ,bake, smoke slow cook air fry ,in fact just about everything all with the ability to smoke under any setting.Chances are this will push aside any existing bbq already already have and add functions you never thought of.What's more it's electric is very frugal on wood pellets, easy to clean heats up very quickly, holds its temperature and is very easy to use.Got to hand it to ninja....This product has no real competitors and more than a few traditional bbq manufacturer's must be shaking their heads at the ability of this machine......watch you tube vids and believe.

I love my Ninja woodfire electric burner. So much easier and cleaners to use than a gas or coal BBQ. Love the multi-functions it has and the food tastes great. Ideal for small families or couples, ideal for 1- 4 people could stretch to cooking for 6 but no more.

I like the size of this phone, much larger screen than my previous Samsung, suits my fat fingers better. Downside, I like to keep my phone in a wallet which makes this one a little bulky when it's booted up but can't have it all. Battery capacity is good and doesn't switch itself off till 2 or 3%. Has a good camera, very sharp and the second optic too which is a boon. Does all I want it to do, very contented with it.

990s for home use - compared with 880s, 770s and Amirons
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 January 2022Style Name: singleVerified Purchase
Just received these this afternoon. I already own Amirons, DT 880s and DT 770s and Grado SR80s. I’m not a fan of Sennheiser, so anyone who is familiar with both Beyerdynamic and Sennheiser headphones will appreciate that this is a subjective review by someone who likes Beyerdynamic’s house sound. This review is my assessment of them purely for home use.There are obviously loads of reviews of the 990s on the internet, and although very popular they obviously divide opinion. I shan’t make out that these are for everybody, but I’ll add my three pennies worth here which might cut through the superlative laden ayes and the damning nays and help some people to make up their minds on whether or not to buy a pair (I dithered for far too long).When I was in my early twenties I might have found the Beyerdynamic sound too bright and analytical, but back then I could hear frequencies up to 20khz; not so now, at 63 my hearing tops out just under 14khz, so maybe this accounts for my later-in-life infatuation with the Beyerdynamic sound. Though I like most forms of music, the bulk of my collection veers towards acoustic music - classical, jazz etc - there’s also a fair bit of dub reggae, rock, EDM and so on (so, it’s basically Prince Far-I to Schubert, Aphex Twin to CSNY, Thelonious Monk to Joni Mitchell, Public Enermy to Spirit, Poppy Ackroyd to Bob Dylan - catholic, essentially).I’ve only had a few hours to make comparisons (Bill Withers, Thelonious Monk, Radio 3, Bill Charlap, Heart of the Congos, Lana Del Rey), but I think this has given me adequate opportunity to make a pretty accurate judgement of the characteristics and comparative merits of the 990s. I’ve been listening to them mainly through a Little Dot Mk 2 with a combination of Novosibirsk and Mullard 8100 valves (sourcing from a Cyrus Cd and Cyrus 8 DAC amplifier).I’m delighted with the 990s. They are neither shriekingly sibilant nor either lacking or over-endowed with bass. Compared to the other headphones that I own I would say that the 990s are nearest in sound to the 880s. Indeed, I think that they are very near sound-wise. The 880s are marginally more polished, but the difference (to my ears at least) is subtle rather than dramatic. I would suggest that the 990s are very good, cheaper alternatives to the 880s. The 880s clamp the head noticeably more lightly than the 990s, but the 990s are more secure on the head. Sound leakage is similar in both, so neither are good for listening to next to your sleeping partner (who hates going off to music and especially hates jazz) in bed unless you want a poke in the ribs. For this I have the 770s, which have a somewhat “fuller” or “fatter” sound than the other two. Leakage on the 770s is minimal at low to modest volumes.The Amirons (Homes) are, to my mind, decidedly more “musical” or “liquid” sounding headphones, very enjoyable for extended listening and very revealing, in comparison with those I would describe the 990s and 880s as rather “analytical” sounding and the 770s are somewhat “dryer” (I hope describing their sound as both “dryer” and “fatter” doesn’t sound like a contradiction in terms but I can’t immediately think of a better words to describe the sound). However, they’re all good and all have what you might call a “house sound” (i.e. a Beyerdynamic sound), although the Amirons depart furthest from this sound (which isn’t really very far at all) while the others might all be considered even more typical. The Amirons have a  fuller, certainly pleasant and, I would say, slightly coloured bass by comparison, the bass on the 880s and 990s is leaner and, as far as I am qualified to judge, seemingly more accurate. Some people say that they both lack bass, but I don’t think this it true, it is most certainly there when it’s there! It may be that those who think they lack bass are listening to these headphones without suitable amplification. As goes the 770s, I’d say that their bass - in terms of weight - lies in the middle here, it is perfectly good but it is neither as accurate as on the 880s and 990s nor as pleasurable as on the Amirons.Sound stage is best, and very similar, on the 990s, 880s and Amirons. I wouldn’t say that there is  any vastly significant difference here between these three headphones. The 770s, being closed-back, are noticeably more “closed-in” in terms of soundstage but, in terms of closed-back headphones per se they’re actually really rather good in this area; I’ve certainly not encountered a closed-back pair that are better (or indeed any other closed-back pair that I can actually bear - I personally much prefer open-back designs, for me the 770s are exceptions in this department). The 1770s may well be better, but I’m not about to fork out several hundred pounds more for those when I use closed-back headphones mostly for listening in bed via the headphone output of a Roberts radio.As regards comparison with the Grado SR 80s,  the 990s and 880s are decidedly superior sounding, with the Grados sounding rather rough and uncouth by comparison (though this isn’t helped by the Grados comfort levels which are simply not in the same league - half an hour with Grado SR80 ear pads is sheer torture; consequently I’ve replaced them with Sennheiser HD414 ear pads which improbably (as, apart from being yellow, they don’t seem materially that different from the Grado pads) improve matters a fair bit and don’t noticeably change the SR80s sound). The Grados do sound more bassy, but this is definitely a matter of quantity rather than quality. Build quality on the Grado SR80s is also markedly inferior to that of the Beyerdynamics. I would retire the Grados at this point, but their 32 Ohm impedance makes them useful. They’re good fun, but they’re not good for extended listening sessions.The 990s and 880s with their 250 Ohm impedance definitely need amplification. I use a couple of Little Dot Mk 2s. The Amirons have the same impedance but are significantly more sensitive. For unamplified use I find the 770s a better match with their 80 Ohm impedance (they certainly work well with most Roberts radios of recent years, Roberts seem to have pretty good headphone circuits on their radios).Summing up, I think that the 990s are fantastic value for money (the Amiron Homes, which I love, are perhaps a clear case of diminishing returns by comparison). If you’re thinking of buying a pair of Beyerdynamics, want open-backed headphones, fancy the 880s from all you’ve read, but feel that the 880s are a stretch for you financially, then I think you’d be missing very little with the 990s in terms of sound).Originally, I had thought of purchasing Beyerdynamic’s new DT900 X headphones, but - reading the reviews, and knowing how much I already liked the sound of the 880s and 770s - I thought I’d save myself some money and get something that might not sound so hugely different for half the price and, beyond that, I actually prefer the look of the 990s. I don’t rule out considering the new series in future, but for now I don’t feel I’m missing out on anything that would be game-changing, although I admit I’m curious. As I have found repeatedly, however wild the superlatives I encounter in the reviews the actual differences between the last and the latest model of a particular piece of hifi is more often than not a matter of nuance.Whatever way you cut it, comparing the 990s with the highly regarded and (to me) very similar sounding 880s and the more refined, more relaxed, but four or five times more expensive Amiron Homes, they are still very good sounding headphones and first class value for money - assuming, like me, you like the Beyerdynamic sound. If you’re a Sennheiser fan you’d probably be barking up the wrong tree (but you know that already) and, if you’re a Beats fan, then presumably you’re already stone deaf. And then again, as goes highly regarded budget headphones, I reckon they knock the Grado SR80s into a cocked hat. But not everyone would agree with me.Anyway, I hope all that helps.Update, 28/1/22. I’ve now spent some more time listening to the 990s on a Little Dot Mk 2 with a combination of Novosibirsk and Radio Technique valves (sourcing from a Naim CD5 via a Rega Elex R). The Radio Technique valves are very similar to the Mullard 8100s I used at the top of this piece. Continued close listening has only confirmed my sense of how good these headphones are. On further consideration, with this set up, I’d say their sound signature lies between that of the 880s and the Amirons. I’d say they sound slightly “weightier” than the 880s and that the Amirons are a bit more so, but the differences here are more subtle than seismic. On careful comparison, after a few hours of listening, my overwhelming sense at this point is that, if you like open-backed headphones, like the Beyerdynamic sound and have a hankering for a pair of Amirons but either can’t afford them or can’t justify the expense, then you really wouldn’t be missing very much at all by just settling for a pair of 990s. By comparison they are a real bargain and, I think, in absolute terms they are quite simply one of the best bargains there is on the headphone market.One further point, on comfort, although the 990s have more clamping force on the head, I actually find them more comfortable than the Amirons as they fit my head better.Finally, as anyone who has read this far has already probably figured out, it has cost me quite a lot to reach my conclusions here. I think I have a reasonable sense of humour, but if you’re an audiophile sceptic then I guess I can understand why you may feel you’re getting the last laugh! I’m glad I own the Amirons, they are very nice headphones, but if I could only have one pair I must admit that I’d very happily settle for the 990s.Postscript, 31/1/22. On further reflection, it’s very good having several headphones all sharing a general character that I like, but each a little different from the others. Different music works best on certain headphones (for instance, listening to Beatrice Rana’s performance of the Goldberg Variations this morning I much prefer the rendition of her piano’s sound through the Amirons to that of the 770s (the piano sounding decidedly more lifelike through the Amirons), whereas with Thelonious Monk’s It’s Monk’s Time the difference is less obvious and, if anything, I’d say I actually prefer the 770s with their greater attack. But, different music is not all: different recordings, different source equipment, different mood of the listener ... however, it’s very quick and easy to change between modestly priced headphones during a listening session in order to optimise your listening experience (something you can’t readily do with expensive speakers, amplifiers, cartridges and so on).

A detailed, spacious and big sounding pair of headphones!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 August 2013Style Name: singleVerified Purchase
I have owned a pair of Sennheiser HD-580 Precision headphones (they based on the original HD600, and use the same driver) for many years now, but having gone over from using Hi Fi separates, to computer based audio equipment, I have been longing for a slightly more powerful sound, something that has a little more impact and sparkle than my old HD-580s, which are a lovely sounding headphone.I was initially sceptical about these Beyerdynamic DT990 Pros, simply because of the low price, and the deep confusion that surrounds all the various different ohm ratings Beyerdynamic use across many of their ranges.  It seems that the sound actually varies depending on which impedance rating you end up purchasing, as to if you will get too much treble, or too much bass, or deeply recessed mids.After spending much time reading many reviews and forums regarding the DT990 Pro, versus the DT770/880 Pro range, I settled on the 990 Pro 250 Ohm version, as it's hard to justify double the cost for the 32 OHM versions of these.After opening up the box, I was instantly reminded that the cable is of the coiled variety.  This kind of reminds me of those big boxy headphones you could get in the 70's!  However after actually using the headphones, the coiled cable is actually better for me than having nearly 3 meters of cable hanging on the floor in front of my computer, where I sit when listening to music.So, just to set the scene, the 990's are connected to my computer via an Objective2 headphone amp, with built-in ODAC, connected to the computer using USB.  I use J.River Media Player v19, and have it set to directly connect to the ODAC at 24Bit & 44KHz Sample rate.I started out by having my trusty Sennheisers connected first, and listened to some music, just to give myself a reference point for the 990's.  Then I quickly replaced the Senns with the 990s, and wow!!!  To my surprise, the 990's actually sounded slightly louder, and had much better bass, and much more detailed upper mids and treble.  The overall midrange was about the same as the Senns, so I was instantly in love with the 990's!  They have a wider soundstage, as well as better positioning compared to the Senns, which kind of sound a little lifeless in direct comparison to the 990's.  My o2 amp really got the Senns working as well as my old Hi Fi seperates used to, but they lacked impact in the bass, and always were a little dull sounding in the top ranges (the infamous Sennheiser veil at play!).  These 990 Pro's just give me all that is best about the Sennheiser 580's, but improve on the bass and detail, making them a really good and balanced sounding headphone.  I can only think that those who claim these 990 Pros have a recessed midrange are using either badly matching equipment, or just bad equipment in the first place.I find the bass on the 990's are very deep, rich and fast.  They really brings out sub-bass nicely, but not in an artificial or bloated way, it really has to be heard to be understood properly! The upper bass notes are natural, tight and punchy, certainly not of the one note variety, which the Senns can tend to be with some music.  The treble is definitely more present than my Sennheisers, but I would not call these artificially bright by any means, but it is fair to say that these headphones require a good quality headphone amp, something with a neutral sound.  If your equipment is on the bright side, then these headphones may be a little revealing of that.I find the DT990 Pros to be very comfortable, and have a relatively low clamping force, slightly lower than all my Sennheiser headphones that I've ever owned, so I'm not sure why some people claim these headphones can be a little tight on the head, I almost wish they clamped a tiny bit harder!  The velour earpads are really comfy, and very similar in feel to the Sennheisers. (sorry to keep comparing these phones to Sennheisers, but the senns are a gold standard, and twice the price of these, so I think it's fair to compare.I have not had a chance to try these with my iPhone 5, or my iPad 3 yet, but I think these headphones probably will not be efficient enough, and will lack volume, but when I get the time to try them out, I will update this review.The bottom line is that at £120, they are an absolute steal.  I think you would have to spend more than 3 times this money to actually get something with a better sound.  Maybe the Audeze LCD2 would be a nice, noticeable step up, but anything else would not really have the value for money factor that you get with the 990 Pros!

Had been using ITCH for a while (over a year on 3 cats) and ended up with a full on flea infestation. Fleas were jumping on me 10 at a time kind of bad in the summer and the cats were even worse off. Itch is basically the same chemical as Frontline which fleas unfortunately seem to be resistant to nowadays which is why vets don't use it anymore but might still work for you?Got some Advantage to try something different and OMG the difference!! Even in the height of hot weather I have seen 2 fleas this year and that's only when I skipped a month when it got colder. I didn't even do a full on flea spray everywhere in the house but haven't seen any. With 4 pipettes it's also great value with 3 fleabags to take care of so would highly recommend this product if you're having an issue with fleas which can be miserable for both you and the cat. So far I haven't found anything more effective or better value. The one from the vets was good but can't remember the name and was expensive for 3 cats. Just try this. Frontline used to work well but the fleas became immune so hoping the same doesn't happen with Advantage.  I'm sure some people won't have the same great results but give it a couple of months to work especially if you have a lot of fleas like I did. It's easy to use with little screwtop tubes you just pierce the top with the end of the cap so if the cat makes a run for it before you can dose them, you can at least put the lid back on for later. Now if your cat is sleeping, you might be able to sneak this on quickly before they realise what's happened but otherwise grab kitty by the scruff of the neck and put the drops high on the back of their necks above where your hand is so they can't really reach it to clean it off after. They don't like it, they are cats so they don't like anything but it doesn't seem to cause them any discomfort and they all act normally after even if they might avoid you for about an hour incase you trap them into some other unpleasant situation. Don't get me started on worming tablets!Obviously any pet could have some kind of allergic reaction to different products so make sure your pet is ok after dosing them, other than sulking quietly for a bit, and check there is no reaction on their skin. All mine have been fine with this product.I have two very outdoorsy cats and one stay at home but does go out, just for reference, so they are all constantly exposed to bringing fleas in from outside so have found this to be an absolute miracle worker.

A really great step up from my old Rift
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 January 2024Configuration: Headset onlySize Name: 128GBVerified Purchase
I have been a fan of VR since the original Rift, indeed my most popular review on here was for just that product.  I spent an age playing Elite Dangerous and various driving sims in VR and definitely got my money's worth from it.As with the Rift, I had got some vouchers from work which made this a relatively inexpensive buy.  A friend had let me try his out and I had been blown away.  With the old Rift, you had a 'screen door' feeling where you could see the outline of the pixels that were making up the image.  It wasn't enough to spoil the experience, but was definitely noticeable.  Also with the Rift, the lenses were such that you only ever looked straight ahead.The Quest is an enormous leap forward in quality.  The image is clean and crisp, you are not connected to your PC by a cable so can play anywhere you want to, the movement of the image is silky smooth and the lenses are set up in a way that gives you the ability to move your eyes and see peripherally.  The passthrough camera is really handy too, tap the controller twice on the side of your headset and whatever application you are using will be replaced with a view in front of you, handy for re-orienting yourself if you happen to stray outside of your gaming space.  Worth noting too that the Quest has a very clever application that scans the room you are in and helps you map out your play area, if you move towards the edges, it will show you a mesh overlaid on whatever you are playing to show where you might be straying close to a wall, door or whatever.  Even so, it would take a braver man than me to play in the same room as a large TV, a collection of fine china, a pyramid of champagne glasses - you get my drift.I am not going to dock any stars, but I do want to point out a few things that are important to know in advance:- Battery life, when using processor intensive applications, will give you a little over 2 hours use.  This isn't really a problem as you won't often want to be strapped into the headset for that long.  That said, as I do a fair bit of racing in VR which can last longer than the battery, I have dealt with by buying a replacement strap with a battery passthrough from Kiwi Design (highly recommended, and reviewed on here separately).  Budget about £60 more if you want a similar upgrade.- Onboard memory - you can buy the Quest in 128Gb or 512GB versions.  Given how cheap solid-state memory is, I balked at the cost uplift for the 512Gb version and bought the 128, and honestly unless you want all your VR apps stored on the headset itself you really don't need 512Gb.  Save some money and buy the lower-storage version.- The headstrap that the Quest comes with is perfectly functional, but not the most comfortable for longer sessions.  As noted above, I have replaced this with one by Kiwi Design which makes the whole thing much more comfortable.- If you want to play titles from your PC on the rift, check that your motherboard supports the necessary connectivity, otherwise you may have to buy a passthrough cable which will mean you are tethered to your PC (as well as out of pocket for the cable).  Mine does, and I happily play Half Life Alyx and other titles downstairs in my conservatory where I have plenty of space.So that's all the consumer advice that I have to share.  The gaming experience is fabulous.  Half Life Alyx is mindblowing, it really feels like you are there although having life-size headcrab zombies shambling towards you is quite unnerving!  Assetto Corsa looks amazing, and sitting in the cockpit of your chosen car feels so natural.  Microsoft Flight Simulator - well basically you feel like you are flying a real plane.If you are considering upgrading from an older VR experience, or thinking of taking the plunge for the first time, this is a really impressive offering at a reasonable cost and one I recommend highly.  I am happy to answer any questions that you may have about any details I have not covered here.

revolutionary if used with a better headstrap
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2024Configuration: Headset onlySize Name: 128GBVerified Purchase
VR gaming and home cinema are both incredible.This headset is a huge upgrade from the quest 2 (Q2)  in terms of its visuals and comfort; greater clarity and less eyestrain. The reduction in eyestrain vs the Q2 is a huge feature for me, perhaps this is due to the proper inter-pupillary distance settings it has vs Q2. Text is easily readable and movies/video look really good on the cinema size screen.A head-strap like the Bobo vr m3 is an essential accessory as the stock one is very uncomfortable and you certainly wouldn't want to spend 2 hours plus to watch a movie with the stock head-strap but you can with a good replacement one.A proper head-strap is a game changer for comfort; with one you won't need to take the headset off because your face can't take it anymore, you just finish playing when you're bored or have other things to do (like with normal consoles) , I don't know why Meta don't stock decent head-straps as default like Sony and Valve.FYI I thought the elite head-strap wasn't much good either, defo not worth £70.Graphics are what you might expect of mobile gaming; think ps3 rather than ps5. The better chip vs Q2 hasn't really been put to much use at this point imo with only one Q3 exclusive and some OK graphics updates, hopefully in the future this will change.Haven't used MR much yet but I feel it could be quite good. The visual experience of passthrough is not that great imo (grainy) although obviously much better than the rubbish Q2 MR. Visual experience is good enough to do basic tasks like picking up objects and moving around but not typing or reading a monitor. There is not much warping and the latency is very low. Doesn't produce much eyestrain which is a game changer in usability however.Summary: actually useful VR/MR headset. The headset is cheaper than a massive TV and more useful. Gaming in VR is epic. Not much eyestrain, great clarity and is actually comfortable to wear with a decent 3rd party head-strap. VR/MR has come a long way indeed.

Definitely buy new
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 April 2024Configuration: Headset onlySize Name: 128GBVerified Purchase
I did try buying a used headset which was a nightmare but honestly I recommend getting a brand new unit and taking good care of it, the quality for the price is outstanding, I've never had so much fun in gaming for a long time.The graphics are brilliant, I think sometimes people expect too much from a standalone VR headset, this is class leading. Setup is simple & getting a comfortable fitting position is easy, not too tight but not too loose is the best to avoid problems.Battery life is in my opinion in the sweet spot, I've never had the warning message that the battery is low come up before I've already decided I'll stop playing soon.Games are great and there is a wide selection and constant discounts / sales, this headset gives you the chance to get a workout without even realizing it depending on the games you choose to play & there is also plenty of sitting down games to choose from as well if you just fancy a relaxing evening.

Loving this phone so far
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 October 2022Colour: ObsidianSize Name: 128GBStyle Name: Pixel 7 ProVerified Purchase
If you watch MKBHD or Dave2D etc on YouTube, you'll see proof of how good this phone is. I've had it since yesterday and I am really loving it so far. I switched from a OnePlus 7Pro which I had for about 4 years, it had served me well but it was starting to get slow.The Google Pixel 7 Pro has been a brilliant upgrade. It truly feels like smartest smartphone on the market. It is extremely intuitive and has lots have nice little additions that make your life easier. The screen is lovely and a great size, especially the 120Hz refresh rate! Battery has lasted a long while for a 1440p screen with a high refresh rate.The sound is slightly tinny I'll admit, but it prioritises voice clarity, so it makes up for it in that region.The camera is outstanding, really on par with Samsung and iPhone. The processing, sharpness, and colour is very realistic and uses that HDR well. It is especially great with it's neat features like Magic Eraser and Face Unblur.The pain has been that it does not come with a wall charger which means I'm panicking about buying one from the Google store. I'm currently using a Mac charger lead which is probably not ideal.This phone really does make smile with all its intelligent little features. It all works swiftly and smoothly, especially the Google Wallet and multitasking.I am in my 20s and would consider myself a techie. So I really recommend this! Excited to get my free Google earbuds pro. I would suggest not getting the smartwatch as from what I'm hearing, the battery is no good and it is too small. Whereas, the earbuds are supposedly the best on the market.

I upgraded from an Honor 9 that I'd had for nearly 5 years.  I bought it through the Amazon Wearhouse in like new condition for a great saving and it was pristine!This phone is amazing!  I love the photo quality and editing ability. The built-in assistant that I've set a morning routine that sets an alarm, tells me a joke, my plans for the day and then plays my Spotify playlist. It's fast for browsing social media and playing games too.  I also really like the keyboard response when you're typing.  Fingerprint sensor and face recognition work brilliant and the battery lasts all day.  Charging can take a bit longer than my last phone, but hopefully that will preserve the life of the battery.So pleased that I've chosen this phone and I hope it lasts as long as my last one!

Last google phone I had was a few years ago and called a Nexus 4. That was agreat phone and as my redmi note10 pro wasnt happy with a broken screen and being dropped in the sink, I though ""why not"" so after a lot of reasearch and price checking (Amazon was the cheapest) I bought this beauty. Strangley it was cheaper for the 256gb than the 128gb. So a case and screen protectors later and next day delivery had me chuckling like a first time user of a mobile phone. So I went with the hazel colour scheme and it really is a good looking colour. Feels good in the hand and has a screen thats so sharp. Anyhow, set up was a breeze even from the old redmi. Just follow the pixel instructions and away you go. Everything and I mean everything copied over including settings pics the lot. No issues at all. As regards the phone.....well constructed and a good 1.25 days battery life. Remembered you need to buy a charger brick as theres not one  included, but a recommendation sorted that out for under £16. Also double check that the chargers you use do infact work on the pixel as I've found a couple of first gen 'C' type dont. So all in all a good phone that isstreets ahead of anything else Ive had and is great to use.

My previous phone was 6 years old and still worked OK, but was starting to get a bit slow and bad with battery life, so I thought it was time to invest in a new one!I'm not a professional, I use my phone for basic things, so I don't need it to do anything fancy, but I was drawn to this one as I've seen good things about it, especially the camera.It's a really beautiful phone, and setting it up was so easy to do. I inserted my SIM card, got it fully charged, and followed the on-screen instructions. I used the cable provided to connect my old phone to this new one, and everything was transferred over, all my apps/contacts/photos etc. It couldn't have been easier.It's lovely to use, the screen is big and bright and high quality, and really responsive. I don't use face recognition or fingerprint lock, so I can't comment on those, but there are lots of little features I like. I've changed the settings so if I double tap the back of the phone it will take a screenshot. I think the battery life is great, (I don't really play games or watch TV/films often though) it's simple to use, and the camera is amazing, like I hoped it would be!Again, I'm not a professional, but I was so impressed with how the camera does most of the hard work for me, focusing on what I want to photo, blurring the background slightly, and just looking so clear and high quality. (see my flower photo) The 'unblur' and 'magic eraser' tools are brilliant, it's given new life to some old photos especially, which I've managed to edit.For an example, I took a simple photo of my garden, and managed to remove the yard brush/tree/2 solar lights, simply by circling them in Edit, and I think the result is great!However, I'm giving the phone 4/5 stars, as there were a couple things that disappointed me.Firstly, I know I'm probably behind with the times, and I didn't expect an actual plug to be included, but considering the price of the phone, I expected a USB charging cable included. You only get the double ended USB C cable, and since I don't have a USB C plug, I had to buy one.I was also disappointed that you can't insert an SD card into this phone. I went for the 256GB storage, so I don't think it will ever be an issue for me, and there are options to store photos etc elsewhere, but I felt like there should be an option to put one in if I wanted.Another little thing I noticed, is when I have been cropping photos or doing anything close to the edge of the screen, it can sometimes think I'm swiping, and it goes back, which is annoying.Overall, even with the issues I've said, I am really impressed and happy with my new phone. It works above and beyond what I need it for, and I haven't even scratched the surface of everything it can do.

This is a converter for use with a DVD player or other older type visual items. In my case I used it to enable me to use an early Dvd  player. It is  easy to use and the results are splendid.

Turn the 2 items you are connecting off first!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2023Verified Purchase
Initially disappointed as the lead did not seem to work. I looked on YouTube for advice and found that the little USB lead needed to be connected also, for power, and that the TV (no scart)and DVD player (with scart) needed to be turned off while connecting the cables.  It worked after that. So 4 stars because instructions were unclear.

After researching and testing many headphones I believe that the Sony WH-1000XM5 represent the best option for most consumers at this price point.Pros- Industry leading Noise Cancelation - Apple and Sony are both firmly ahead of other brands in term of Active Noise Cancelation.- Sound Quality - Impressive and rich sound quality, crisp and tight bass with delicate highs. Sound stage is slightly narrow.- 30 Hours of Battery with a fast charging time means that these are always ready to go even with intensive use.- Build Quality and Comfort is excellent. Premium feel in the hands.Cons- The Sony app feels a little dated and is not user friendly. I experienced a few bugs and technical issues. Software updates to the headphones are relatively minor and can take 1 hour+ to install. Fortunately the app doesn't need to be used much outside of initial set up.- The material whilst premium is a finger print and grease magnet. It collects smudges easily on it's matte surface which are hard to remove and wipe off.ConclusionOverall these headphones provide great performance in all categories. Whilst other headphones in this price point have strong pros and cons, Sony delivers consistently on all fronts.

Excellent sound, noise-cancelling and comfort
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2023Colour Name: BlackStyle Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I read and watched a lot of reviews about ANC headphones and the Sony XM5s kept coming up as one of the top picks. Even though I was tempted by cheaper, but still highly rated headphones this seemed to be the best.Now that I have used it for a couple of weeks I can say I am really happy with my choice.COMFORT *****This is one I can wear all day - the soft headphone cups are very comfortable and I do not feel the strap at all and I have very short hair. The headset is adjustable and it even comes with a tutorial in the app that shows you how to set it. If you don't follow this I can see how some people could squeeze it on and feel it's too tight or sore on the headband but just following in the instructions there is nearly no weight on the headphone strap and it is padded well enough.SOUND *****The sound quality is excellent. Out of the box it sounds good but with the app provided fine tuning the EQ it is exceptional. For music you really can hear the detail in songs. The base is super clean with no distortion and plenty of depth and mids are clear and full, not the hollow scooped out sound you get from some other headphones. The highs are crystal clear without being tinny.Movies are great to listen to. Even without APTX low latency it has no problems with delays or lip sync on anything I have tested on Phone (Android) or desktop (Windows). Movies with great sound design like A quiet place 2 are incredible. Note I am using the Alternative A2DP Driver from bluetooth goodies on Windows so that I can use LDAC codec for higher bandwidth and quality and Tidal for high quality music but it works very well with spotify and standard windows bluetooth connection.Gaming - if you really look for it you can notice a slight delay but nothing that affects gameplay for me. Explosions, atmospheric music, dialogue all sound fantastic from Single player story driven games like Final Fantasy 7 Remake to competitive multiplayer like Naraka Bladepoint or Apex legends.Connectivity ****With support for Bluetooth 5 and LDAC connection should be solid. Never had cutouts or distortion when within the advertised range even through walls. It support multi device which allows you to connect to your tablet or PC while still controlling EQ, ANC and switch between devices from your phone which works well. Sadly if you use multidevice it prevents using LDAC so I leave this feature turned off as it is still really quick and easy to switch between devices - as soon as you hit connect on a paired device it takes over the connection,  you get the ding and it's ready to go. It also remembers which of the devices it was last connected to when you turn it on.ANC *****The Active Noise cancelling is S tier - it really does work well. Cancelling out much more background noise than expected making it a dream to use in a noisy office or café. The way they have implemented pass through is really good so you can just hold you hand to the right ear to lower the volume of your music and have the 8 mics pass the outside sound to you and amplify it so you can quickly talk to someone. I don't use the automatic pass through when you start talking feature but I could see it being useful for some people. It also has good noise cancelling for the mic so making a voice/video call in a noisy area still sounds great for both you and the person you are calling.NegativesOf course there are some negatives but thankfully they are relatively minor.Firstly, they do not fold down as compact as other headphones. You're not going to fit this into your pocket or even want to throw it into a bag but it does come with a nice case and so constatly wearing it or take a big enough bag for it in the case.The other is that although the soft touch material on the cups feels way better than plastic or metal and transfers a lot less sound if something rubs against it like a hood or your hand it does leave unsightly greasy marks. I am experimenting with skins for it from xtreme skins as you can see in one of the photos which solves the problem but I didn't find the skins a good fit for the curved sides but your mileage may vary. I probably will put up with the greasy look to avoid the extra weight and faff of the stickers.The battery life would fall into this category as while very good it is not as long as some cheaper models offer. I can still run it all day with no issues of comfort or battery but I do find I am topping it up every other day instead of once a week as I have done with previous headsets. It's understandable with the relatively light weight and constantly on HQ ANC or pass through (I never use ANC off completely).Not really a negative as I didn't expect this from it but this is not a headset to wear while working out, jogging or in the rain. It has no water resistance. For those purposes I prefer to use earbuds anyway and find the Pixel Buds do the job just fine but of course the sound quality and lack of ANC mean it does not compare when you have the option of the Sony XM5s.Overall an excellent headset if you can appreciate great sound quality even if not an audiophile, with top notch noise cancelling and comfort.

Never had cutouts or distortion when within the advertised range even through walls. It support multi device which allows you to connect to your tablet or PC while still controlling EQ, ANC and switch between devices from your phone which works well. Sadly if you use multidevice it prevents using LDAC so I leave this feature turned off as it is still really quick and easy to switch between devices - as soon as you hit connect on a paired device it takes over the connection,  you get the ding and it's ready to go. It also remembers which of the devices it was last connected to when you turn it on.ANC *****The Active Noise cancelling is S tier - it really does work well. Cancelling out much more background noise than expected making it a dream to use in a noisy office or café. The way they have implemented pass through is really good so you can just hold you hand to the right ear to lower the volume of your music and have the 8 mics pass the outside sound to you and amplify it so you can quickly talk to someone. I don't use the automatic pass through when you start talking feature but I could see it being useful for some people. It also has good noise cancelling for the mic so making a voice/video call in a noisy area still sounds great for both you and the person you are calling.NegativesOf course there are some negatives but thankfully they are relatively minor.Firstly, they do not fold down as compact as other headphones. You're not going to fit this into your pocket or even want to throw it into a bag but it does come with a nice case and so constatly wearing it or take a big enough bag for it in the case.The other is that although the soft touch material on the cups feels way better than plastic or metal and transfers a lot less sound if something rubs against it like a hood or your hand it does leave unsightly greasy marks. I am experimenting with skins for it from xtreme skins as you can see in one of the photos which solves the problem but I didn't find the skins a good fit for the curved sides but your mileage may vary. I probably will put up with the greasy look to avoid the extra weight and faff of the stickers.The battery life would fall into this category as while very good it is not as long as some cheaper models offer. I can still run it all day with no issues of comfort or battery but I do find I am topping it up every other day instead of once a week as I have done with previous headsets. It's understandable with the relatively light weight and constantly on HQ ANC or pass through (I never use ANC off completely).Not really a negative as I didn't expect this from it but this is not a headset to wear while working out, jogging or in the rain. It has no water resistance. For those purposes I prefer to use earbuds anyway and find the Pixel Buds do the job just fine but of course the sound quality and lack of ANC mean it does not compare when you have the option of the Sony XM5s.Overall an excellent headset if you can appreciate great sound quality even if not an audiophile, with top notch noise cancelling and comfort.

Will come back to this product time and time again
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 March 2024Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I will always come back to this product time and time again as it does everything I need it to.This product is easy to use, even for first timers. It comes complete with well explained instructions and a bristle brush to use for application. However, I don't typically use this, I use an eyebrow brush which enables me to create the style I want.It stays on the eyebrows for the recommended amount of time and I find I get more uses out of it then the box actually says. A little goes a long way.The only negative is that it doesn't come with a mixing pot so you do need to find a little tub to mix it in beforehand.

The best eyebrow product
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 April 2024Colour Name: Dark BrownVerified Purchase
I started using this during lockdown and haven't been back to the salon since. I use dark brown, if you want black and you're new to home kits, I'd suggest trying dark brown first just to be on the safe side. Easy to mix and apply. I use a cotton bud to immediately wipe off any product that's strayed outside the desired shape. You'll look like the guy from Lazy Town whilst it's on.  Try not to panic! The end result,  for me at least,  is always great - makes such a difference.Great product, great value. And I rarely recommend anything!

Easy, quick, little mess (much better than the drops!!) and lasting result. Applying brow tint the very first time scared the hoot out of me, as it gets very dark when developing (be sure not to answer the door in that time). Rinse off after the indicated time, cleanse face with a bit of a rub to get any stains off skin and presto.

Fantastic brow gel - so easy to use and looks great! Found it difficult to shape at first as it applies clear but once it started darkening I realised a few sections that were a bit messed up and just wiped them off nice and easy. Good alternative to a salon trip however doesn't last as long - I use this when I'm in between visits and can't go to salon!

Love this little thing.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 December 2023Size Name: 4GBVerified Purchase
I needed a server up and running with NGinx and multiple servers (modules) quickly, and two websites.I did some reading with a cup of tea and saw that Raspberry Pi 4 was good instead of forking out mega cash (slight exaggeration) on online hosting services. Plus the learning is invaluable to see how it’s all put together.It’s relatively quick; my react pages load quick online, my go server access with database and images (stored on the pi 256GB micro SD) is nice and quick, too. I’ve got an iOS app pulling the data using graphql and it’s pretty quick using port forwarding.If all that sounds like nonsense, it just means the Raspberry is nice and fast for demanding services that process a lot. I’ve not tried games or big apps.It was neatly packaged, and worked out of the box. Get a nSD card.My only gripe is it had a different video output than the pi 3. I should have checked. Details matter.

A superb shaving experience
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2024Style Name: [NEW] inkl. 2 Klingen & 5-in-1 TrimmaufsatzVerified Purchase
I have used OneBlade for a number of years and am incredibly pleased with the quality of the shave it gives.I purchased this replacement as I kept breaking the plastic guards on the older style heads, luckily this is no longer an issue due to the adjustable head provided. The guard head will offer a cut length from 5mm to 1mm.The unit its self is perfect in size, it has a nice grip and design which offers great dexterity when shaving those more hard to reach areas.The head with no guard protection offers a superb cut that is almost comparable in length to clean shaving. It cuts effortlessly with no catching, knicking or pulling. There's no irritation after shaving that you would expect to have with such a low level cut.This upgrades unit comes with a handy USB style charger, moving away from the outdated shaving style plug of earlier models. This is really handy for charging when on the go and stay away from home.Within the package comes:*Shaving unit*USB to shaver unit charging cable*5-1mm adjustable shaving guard (easy to adjust with one hand to desired length)*X2 shaving heads (I replace these approximately every 6 months)* Handy draw string carry bagIf like me you are not a fan of clean shaving and want to maintain some styled beard length then I would not hesitate to recommend this value for money shaver.

I now have three of these, not necessarily because I needed three, but because the shaver was on a deal, which meant it was cheaper to buy the shaver with blades rather than just buying spare blades. absolute madness.  But it is an excellent shaver, battery lasts a long time, easy to use no fussing around with water/soap etc, and very handy when you are away etc.  Recommend, and keep an eye out for deals

Top notch performance, beautiful little devices, base model is a bit flawed.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 July 2018Style Name: OneBlade OriginalVerified Purchase
I own the base model OneBlade and recently bought the Pro too.Philips have been cunning in designing their model range to encourage people to buy the Pro model which no doubt has a higher mark-up. Unfortunately I think they went a tad too far in handicapping the base model.The flaw with the base model is the outdated NIMH battery (I believe the similarly priced Remington model uses a Lithium). They compound this flaw by not having any kind of battery indicator. All you have is a light on the charger to show it is receiving power but the light doesn't even go out when fully charged.The battery takes a long time to charge so you just have to time it yourself as you have no idea if it's full or not. The problem is that NIMH batteries have a memory so you can't really keep it on permanent charge. This is a big problem as you don't know how how much juice the battery has left due to the lack of an indicator. So you can't win. You either risk running out of battery mid-shave, or risk charging it too soon and creating a memory problem that reduces battery life.So definitely spend a bit more for a Lithium model. Just the one up from the base model.The shave itself is excellent. Not as quick or close as a top of the range foil shaver but excellent for the price. Compared to my top of the range Braun foil shaver, the OneBlade can shave to a level my beard would be at 5 hours after using the Braun. This is very impressive for such a low cost item (10% of the price of my Braun) which is really designed for stubble trimming so to do so well on a close shave is incredible. Being close but not ""too close"" means that you won't get ingrowing hairs with this.I've not used it on a long beard but it works great trimming a few days worth of stubble too. It could do with a wider range of trimming guides for blending so it was that issue combined with the battery problem that made me buy the top Pro model. The Pro model has a slight disadvantage in that its large trimming guide unit can make it hard to trim the hairs by your nostrils (you start stabbing your nostrils with the spikes on the guide) but you can pull the guide off and trim those bits by hand.The replacement blades might look expensive but then from what I've seen in video reviews, the performance of this device is superior to the Remington model which doesn't need replacements. Ultimately it costs less to run than my Braun did with its cleaning fluid refills and I am sure this is cheaper than buying replacement blade heads for your Gillette.I'd give the base model and the Pro a 4 star out of 5 review.I now have the ultimate combination of the Pro model with its great battery and adjustable guide, as well as being able to use the more compact trimming guides of the base unit it on it. So I have a 5 star out of 5 product! Just a shame I had to buy two devices! I wish they had chucked in some of the base models guides with the Pro unit. Buying such things separately (like the body hair guide) is a bit expensive and clearly Philips are trying to rake in some big money with a large mark-up on those accessories.

Great shaver for those with sensitive skin, and for those without.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 June 2020Style Name: OneBlade OriginalVerified Purchase
I've been using the Oneblade as my main shaver for the last 4 years. I'm now on my 3rd unit, though this is more down to me losing my washkit rather than any fault of the unit itself. Over this time, I have used many razors, and this is the one I have, and will continue to come back to.Over this time, I've used it to edge a rather splendid beard, daily clean shaven for work, and these days, keeping the overall facial fuzz down to a dull roar using the beard combs (5mm most of the time, though the 3mm one gives an excellent deliberate stubble that's most scratchy indeed).It's also done the duties of removing several eyebrows from my peers, forsaken in wagers better not made, and been used against me to remove a moustache that in hindsight should not have been there in first place.The way the blade works makes it easy to cut through both long and short stubble, and gives one of the best dry shaves I've had, certainly at speed. The unit is light, and the blade edged on both sides, with little around it. This makes it very easy to get the positioning right and avoid accidental slips (and catastrophic results...), which I cannot say for some other razors of this type that are somewhat more unwieldy.Joking aside, I do have sensitive skin and stopped wet-shaving daily for this reason. This product does not give as close a shave as a proper wet shave, but is the closest to it that I've gotten in a way that doesn't irritate my skin, and unless one is rubbing ones face against the grain, is generally imperceptible. For those in a service background, this isn't one you can get away with for 2 days unless feeling particularly confident, with a stubble normally visible the next morning.I travel frequently for work, and when I was shaving daily, I would normally be happy chancing it without the charger for a 4~5 day trip. At one stage, I had the model above this one (4 beard combs included) which does include an upgraded Lithium Ion (Versus the NiMh in this version) battery, which I recall being slightly better for longevity, but the shaving experience was identical.My one singular complaint is the mechanical durability of the blades. One should really avoid throwing this loose into a washkit. The mechanism that allows the head to rotate is fragile, and doesn't handle impacts well. To protect against this, Phillips include a little plastic head cover, but I lost that quickly. Instead, I just pop the head off and place it in the washkit separately, and have a new blade (individually packaged) that also lives there just in case.In summary, it's a cracking razor and I've not found one as good for the price. Make sure to get the bundles like this one with the extra blades included, and I've seen these going on very low prices on most of the Amazon sales, so worth keeping an eye out (even just for the blades).

Amazing Budget Phone That Proves You Don't Need To Spend £1000
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 May 2020Country format: United KingdomColour: BlackSize Name: 128GBVerified Purchase
I bought this phone as I was looking for a second phone that wasn't too expensive, but wouldn't be horrible to use. I was looking at the iPhone SE 2020, however the difference between using that and my iPhone 11 Pro Max is too much; I'm too pro-big screen now!Enter the Samsung Galaxy A71; I first heard about this phone from a recommended YouTube video, and after also looking at the A51, I decided to spend the extra and get this. I'm glad I did!I'll go over the positives, negatives and experience compared to my main phone, the iPhone 11 Pro Max.POSITIVES. Very light - this phone is incredibly light for the size! It's very comfortable to hold in one hand.. Build - a lot of people list plastic bodies as a negative, but I like the change from the typical slippery glass back.. Amazing screen - the screen on this phone is incredible! It's big at 6.7"", and while it may not be 1440p, I find it very sharp. Colours are amazing - it's set to ""Natural"" tuning out of the box, but I set it to be more saturated and I absolutely love it.. Battery - at time of review I've had this phone for a few days so take this with a grain of salt, but battery life is great. Lasts throughout the day with no issues, could easily last half way through the next day as well.. Fast charging - phone completely charges from around 30% in under an hour, close to 40 minutes. Operating System - Samsung's skin has definitely changed for the better! Last Samsung I had was the S7 edge. Lots of modifications to make handling such a tall phone easier, and the phone feels fast after changing the animation times to be 0.5 times normal.. What's in the box - if I had just been given the phone and a normal charger I wouldn't have complained since the value would still be amazing, however it comes with a fast charger in the box and a pair of in ear earphones!. Storage - 128GB storage is insane. The 11 Pro Max starts at 64! It does have expandable storage also, but I haven't used it as 128 is enough for me.NEGATIVES. No wireless charging - I really like wireless charging, I use it to charge my iPhone every night. No idea why this is a feature reserved for flagships.. User experience - this is more on Samsung/Android than the phone itself, but it just doesn't feel as smooth as my 11 Pro max. Even with animations set to normal speeds, some animations just feel jarring. Samsung's UI could do with some more polish.. Software bloat - this phone comes with a lot of apps pre-installed, where they could just offer the Google version (e.g. the Photos app). Also it comes with Facebook pre installed which I absolutely hate. Luckily you can disable it! On the flip side, some really useful Samsung apps don't come pre installed, such as Good Lock and Samsung Pass.. Speaker - the speaker setup on this is dreadful. One bottom facing speaker which is easily blocked with one finger. Should have gone for a dial speaker setup which is the norm right now.. Camera - this phones camera isn't bad. I actually like the versatility of the camera setup. What I don't like it how terrble the pictures looked out of the box. It wasnt until using it a few times that I realised that it doesn't use the 64MP sensor by default - you have to change from 3:2 to 3:2 64MP camera mode, which I found really confusing.. Performance - while this phone performs perfectly fine for 80% of the time, the 20% of the time that it doesn't it noticeable. Freezing when I go into an app (typically happens in Chrome), taking a while to realise I've turned the phone into horizontal mode. Also there seems to be a consistent bug where I'll stop getting notifications during the later half of the day, for no rhyme or reason. I have nothing set up stopping notifications from coming in. Restarting the phone fixes this issue, but even doing so made me realise that I've never had to do that with my 11 Pro Max.VS THE 11 PRO MAXThis phone makes me feel stupid for buying the 11 Pro Max. There, I said it.. While using this phone, I honestly cannot justify spending over £1000 for the 11 Pro Max, or any other phone!. I prefer holding this phone since it's much lighter, less slippery and I feel a lot less anxious - dropping a £300 phone would worry me less than dropping the Pro Max!. The display is bigger and more colourful, I actually prefer the display on this phone over the one on the 11 Pro Max!. I miss wireless charging so much. I miss the simplicity of iOS. Android is nice, but iOS makes a lot more sense and has a much more pleasant user experience. I do appreciate being able to play Pokémon Emerald on this though.. The camera quality and experience is a lot better on the iPhone.. Battery life is better on the 11 Pro Max by about 25%SUMMARYI may have listed quite a few negatives on this phone, and comparing it to an iPhone 11 Pro Max may feel unfair, but I really like this phone and it more than holds its ground against the Apple flagship, I'm honestly surprised that budget phones have come such a long way; it shows that mobile phones arent developing as rapidly as they once were.I originally intended for this phone to be a backup/holiday phone, but I might just start taking it in turns, swapping my sim from the iPhone to the Samsung and vice versa.For the A72, my advice would be to add wireless charging and a stereo speaker setup, even if you need to charge a bit more. Keep the amazing display and lightness and you have yourself a winner.(Review written on my Samsung A71)

A flagship from a few years ago but still a very good device.Looking at the spec list, the A71 is ""better"" than the Note 8 in a lot of aspects, especially battery life. The only obvious difference on paper was the slightly lower resolution screen.The size is surprising, it is pretty much the same size as the Note 8, just slightly thinner and a lot lighter. A larger device than expected.Performance is excellent, it seems to perform just as well as a flagship phone during everyday use. The screen is bright and crisp and the device feels premium.Camera quality was initially disappointing, with photos appearing flat and lacking colour. Then a message randomly popped up while using the camera, something along the lines of ""make every detail show in your pictures?"". Accepting this dramatically increased the appeal of the images. I believe this turned on HDR mode and increased the resolution to the full 64MP. It's a difficult comparison as the Note 8 camera was exceptionally good but now the Mrs is happy with the camera.Battery life is very good, as would be expected from the impressive 4,500 mAh battery. It's a night and day improvement over the Note 8, with the Note from new tending to be close to 0 by early evening and the A71 having around 30% remaining with the same use.Overall it's an amazing device. Not so long ago, if you went for the mid range devices there was always a noticeable compromise in things like performance, screen and camera quality and a less premium look and feel. Nowadays it's a completely different story. It's very difficult to see any reason why the Galaxy S series would cost double the price. With flagships receiving such small changes every year, the mid range phones should now be just as appealing. For a lot of people it also means it becomes feasible to buy a sim free device outright and avoid being tied into an outrageously expensive contract.Definitely consider it!

Absolutely Epic But Disc Installation Time Is Ridiculous
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2022Platform For Display: PlayStation 5Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
Title sums it up. Graphically and the engine sounds and handling are truly incredible, the sheer detail of all the cars is something to behold. Full career mode where you customise and tune cars is back with a Big Bang. It’s classic Gran Tourismo but even better.The cons are that the installation of the disc game is ludicrously long. I have high speed fibre and it took 7 hours all in all, I’ve read on the internet that there’s a bug causing it to be overly slow so I expect that to be fixed.Another negative is the lack of latest car models (or ones within the last 2 years) which is disappointing but these are expected to come as a future update.It really is a brilliant game though. For those who haven’t played Gran Tourismo before please be aware it’s a racing sim not and arcade racer so needs practice to get good at but when you do it delivers the best driving game of all time. The depth of the game is huge with all the tuning and used car markets. Ignore the micro transaction options and you’ll enjoy it so much more. The dynamic weather and time of day is also incredible.It’s absolutely brilliant but has a couple of frustrations mainly the long installation time.

A return to form - outstanding
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2022Platform For Display: PlayStation 5Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
This game won’t please the people expecting Forza Horizon, or even Forza Motorsport actually. It is to me a bit like a JRPG for car lovers. No you can’t jump in the fastest car immediately and go straight around the Nordschleife. And that’s what makes it great, and all the more enjoyable once you do get there. Yes you have to work for it, and yes you have to start in the slow (used cars) and work for the rewards. This is what I like. Never change the recipe, please, Polyphony Digital. If I had one criticism, I would actually like a higher difficulty setting that involved giving out less prize money. It’s too easy to make money, even with all assists off and difficulty set to maximum. GT2 was a properly difficult game - I wish this was a bit more like that. Oh and I wish you could sell cars…

Excellent game but must be online.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2022Platform For Display: PlayStation 5Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
Side note: I played the early GT games and bought the Cardigans music because of them. The music in this is poor in comparison.The graphics are excellent with a choice of Full quality with Ray tracing or frame rate priority 60fps. The look of either is great, although I had expected just a bit better overall for next Gen it doesn't seem a massive step up from the last version. Sounds are also excellent and vary with car tuning changes and road handling. Frame rate is a slightly nicer racing feel but it is not massively different in the races I tried (maybe in some!)The controls with the PS5 pad are sublime with rumble feedback. Catching the car from a slide is easier with the pad than a wheel although the feedback from a wheel ( I have Logitech 923) is even more immersive feeling every slide and clip of the curb (or other car). there are the usual in car and out of car views and further adjustemts in car in relation to the cockpit.I have not quite completed the single player, computer AI is reasonable although occasionally prone to taking you out. Tyre wear also seem to kick in a bit suddenly on some races.Online racing is great fun but very competitive, there are ratings for speed and driver conduct.Unfortunately the game must be online for single player as well which is a little annoying.There are the usual licences to complete and also challenges which give decent rewards, some are ridiculously hard ( as they were in the past games). I use the wheel for most but for drift challenges the pad is much better and some of the Rally ones.Some of the cars are extremely expensive and so take a lot of playing to gain the credits or you can purchase credits with real money which I think sucks. Personally I think most cars should be accessible to players when you complete the main game and not used as a money earner, but everyone to their own.

Amazing racing sim
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2022Platform For Display: PlayStation 5Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
Firstly I can't believe how many people are giving this 1 star just because they don't have the patience to wait to download or watch an intro. It's crazy to rate a game before you actually play it! Granted it took me about a day and a half for a 90gb update as I can't get fibre but it was worth the wait. Parts of the game unlock as you go along so it's not all available but it doesn't take too long. I've been playing for about 2 hours a day for about 5 days and just unlocked what I believe is the last area on the map. The racing itself is amazing and you do have to concentrate as there's no kids reverse button like on Forza if you mess up!! Love the license and mission challenges. Their tricky to get the gold but good fun to beat your mates times. You do get given loads of cars throughout the game for winning challenges and races but alot still need to be bought and they do cost alot of credits. Haven't tried the online yet but it does look good and people get bad ratings if they constantly push people off track so really it should be decent racing!

Impressive console VR for a decent price
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2016Verified Purchase
Who can forget the resurgence of interest from the Lawnmower Man movie in 1992 leading to dodgy looking VR arcade machines?  We may have been going mad for it back then, but until recently VR at home has remained out of reach for most people.Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR changed that, but not before the early adopters in the PC world got their hands on Vive and Rift, those rather expensive headsets that require equally expensive PC hardware to run them at their full potential.  Sony’s PSVR aims to provide a middle ground to this market with a fuller VR experience than the mobile headsets but with a budget and hardware that isn’t as high end as the PC.It’s important to state this before going any further because it puts the PSVR into perspective, it’s around half the price of the PC VR sets but promises the same sort of experience, albeit with a little less detail.  It might the price of a new console, but that’s still far more affordable than the price of a high end PC.  But nobody was really sure it could live up to even these expectations, can a device like this really run from a console built in 2013?  It seems it can, with some caveats.You’ll also need to ensure you either own or buy the PS4 camera.  It came with early PS4 packs but can be bought separately, with a new version out to match the PSVR.  Move controllers are optional, but improve the experience in some games. They can be found second hand or in the new dual packs designed for VR.First things first, though.  For a fairly small headset, the box is absolutely massive.  It’s actually designed really well, with a little piece of material that opens the triangular lid half way and reveals the neatly packed wealth of small boxes that could easily go to form a real life game of Sony’s VR title Tumble.  The reason for all these boxes?  Wires, tons of them.The box contains the headset itself, a breakout box, a full power supply in 2 pieces, a USB lead, 3 HDMI leads (1 to the Playstation and 2 for each eye of the VR headset).  There’s a lead that then comes out of the headset and into the smaller box that takes the 2 HDMI cables and transfers the signal to the eyes.  This contains an in-line remote to turn the headset on and off and also allows you to plug in headphones (a set of matching earphones is included, though I can never get in-ear earphones to stay in my ears, but that might just be me.The headset feels very comfortable in use, thanks in part to the high quality materials used.  The headband is stretchable to fit any size head and is easy to adjust, while the actual lenses move in and out to fit your face, even if you wear glasses.Once connected, turning the headset on immediately takes you to the PS4’s menu inside the headset, with a picture on the TV mimicking what you see but in 2D.  This is great for others who may be watching you make a fool of yourself while wearing the headset or for sharing your PSVR experiences.psvr-trying-onand this is how you look with the PSVR on. Very fetching.The actual experience differs based on the game or application you’re playing. Many games require just the Dualshock to control but have the option of using 2 Move controllers.  These might be throwbacks to the previous generation, but they still work fairly well.  There were a few instances, though, when the camera refused to pick them up as they were outside of the space, but most games will take advantage of the space and will compensate for this.The camera itself is used for face tracking.  It’s possible to look 360 degrees around and see things behind you, the headset can cope with this, but tracking movement of things like the move controllers or targets won’t work.  This is similar to the situation with Oculus Rift which is actually getting more cameras to support the forthcoming touch controllers, so this may be an option for Sony in the future.  For now, though,it just requires games to realise the limitations and work around them.  Thankfully, as Rift is similar, many titles have been ported over easily enough and will continue to share the larger catalogue of games as developers get a grip on the new tech.Sony have managed to get full HD (1920×1080) for the headset via screens that show 960×1080 per eye and up to 120Hz refresh. The Vive and Rift are both 90Hz as well, though they both have better resolutions of 2160×1200 overall.  In practice, there is a little difference in picture quality, but in most games this isn’t really noticable when you’re in the thick of things.Motion Sickness is another big issue for VR.  Gear VR, Rift and Vive owners have experienced some sort of VR Sickness in games that require fast paced movement without a centre point to keep them focused.  It’s the same for PSVR.  The 90Hz to 120Hz (depending on game) refresh rate does help to keep this to a minimum, as it does on Vive and Rift, but some games will affect people more than others.  I found RIGS in particular to be a bit of a stomach churning experience, whereas games like Thumper and Battlezone were fine.Overall, though, it’s a hefty investment, though nowhere near that of its PC rivals and although there are plenty of launch games to keep you busy, if you’re worried about the outlay then it may well be worth waiting to see what else developers can do with the format.  For those that can afford it, the Playstation VR hardware is impressive for the price point as an accessible console Virtual Reality solution that can run happily on a standard PS4.

Genuinely new gaming experiences
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2017Verified Purchase
The future is here! PSVR delivers what was promised, a high quality and immersive gaming experience. While not as high fidelity as the more expensive Oculus Rift and Vive products on PC, I think Sony have made the right compromises to deliver a relatively cost effective VR solution.The headset itself is well built, as you would expect from a company that has been building consumer electronics for decades. Ergonomics work really well - you can tighten the strap at the back of your head and also adjust the distance between your eyes and the lenses pretty easily. The weight rests mainly on the front of your head, just above the forehead, and given the way it is balanced, you don't really feel the weight I find. Well designed kit.In terms of the VR experiences themselves, I found a large variety of games available on day one. Headset resolution is lower than what you would see on your HD screen, but detailed enough - just - not to break the immersion. Highlights for me so far are Ocean Descent (VR Worlds), Rez Infinite and the X-Wing mission in Star Wars Battlefront. Wearing the headset and being able to look around (360 degrees in some cases) have meant gaming experiences I have not had before and I've been gaming for over 30 years...aiming by turning your head in Rez Infinite is an example of this...could well be faster than using a mouse......so in all a great product and well worth it. I have only 2 gripes - firstly, the cable setup requires your PS4 signal to be passed through the little breakout box to the TV via HDMI. This is fine if you have a vanilla PS4, but if you have a PS4 Pro and HDR capable 4K TV, you will soon realize that the box is not HDMI 2.0a compatible, so it cannot pass through the 4K HDR signal. This requires then, some cable swapping when wanting to play non-VR HDR capable games (which are actually rare right now). This is a little fiddly and a bit of an oversight, not a deal breaker though. Second gripe is the resolution - it is good enough for immersive VR, but you can see that the future iterations of this will be pin sharp in comparison. I think in terms of today's price vs. tech trade off, PSVR gets it right, but the future will be even better!My final point is that the VR games are definitely sharper and smoother on a PS4 Pro - I've used the headset on both the vanilla PS4 and the Pro. Experiences are great on vanilla PS4, but just that bit better on a Pro, so the latter is the way to go if you want the absolute performance from your new VR headset.

Since childhood, I always admired and loved Barbie and could never imagine that one day, Barbie would come into my home.  This is how I feel.  The doll is very pretty, realistic and living to me.  The love and care that was taken to create it, all that effort, has won my love, admiration and respect for Barbie.  I am so so glad I watched this movie.

It took 3 attempts to get this product. The first doll arrived packaged in a bag so was bashed about and damaged. The replacement came with stickers on the actual product and no other packaging so that was also damaged. No good for a collector's item! I was told there was no stock to replace the second doll so just returned it. After checking Amazon there was actually stock so I bought it again. This time it arrived perfectly packaged in a sturdy box and looks great. My 4 star count is for the actual doll itself, which is decent quality and looks good but is overpriced in my opinion.

I have had my clear retainers for about a year and they had become a little clouded and rough. After the first round of using this product, they were less cloudy but still rough. I have since used the product 3 more times and my retainers are now bright, clear, smooth and good as new! Quick and easy to use and get so many tablets in a box to use.

Bio-Oil Skincare Oil: The Essential Solution for Skin Concerns!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 July 2023Size: 200 g (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
Bio-Oil Skincare Oil has been a lifesaver for me. I've used it to treat stretch marks from my battle with Crohn's disease, my wife used it during both pregnancies and we used it to treat a scar on my son's head after a fall. This versatile oil works wonders, delivering noticeable results and promoting healthy skin.The lightweight and non-greasy texture of Bio-Oil makes it a pleasure to use. It absorbs quickly, leaving the skin feeling smooth and supple. I appreciate how it addresses various concerns, such as dryness, uneven tone, and the appearance of scars and stretch marks.Since using Bio-Oil I've witnessed a visible improvement and I feel the oil has also helped diminish the appearance of stretch marks and my son's scar, restoring our confidence and promoting healthy skin.  I’ve found that a little goes a long way, making it a cost-effective solution for long-term use.In summary, Bio-Oil Skincare Oil is an essential solution for various skin concerns. Its lightweight texture, noticeable results, and versatility make it invaluable. If you're looking to address stretch marks, scars, or other skin issues, I highly recommend giving Bio-Oil a try.

Heard much about this after a surgery a couple of years ago but did not require it at that point. After more extensive surgery I decided to give it a go on my multiple scar tissue sites.The areas are definitely paler in colour and less shocking red than previously. The product is long lasting and the fragrance is light and according to my partner perfectly pleasant.The skar tissue areas are more flexible and pliant than previously and there had been no negative reaction either on the wound sites nor elsewhere.

I'm not a fan of regular moisturiser because it leaves me feeling sticky. This absolutely doesn't do that, and it smells amazing. My arms have been super soft since I started using it, and it really makes my tattoos look fresh as well (for healed tattoos only - not fresh). I don't think it's made any difference to scar reduction but any scars I put it over are many years old now so I wouldn't expect their appearance to change.

you just done flew into the wrong kitchen, Insect!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2022Verified Purchase
This thing is hugely satisfying to use. It's effective to a range of a few feet and doesn't actually shoot much salt at all per shot (it's literally a few grains), so won't leave a mess everywhere. I live in a rural location and we get a lot of flies in the kitchen in the summer because you just will living near paddocks and pets. This makes it easy (and satisfying) to get them off windows and walls and if you're a good shot take them out mid-air (just watch where the corpse lands). If you have kids (of any age!) in the house this will have them scrabbling to assist with insect pest control for a change. Just expect to hear an awful lot of poor Arnie impressions..... Honestly I think it would be a great novelty gift for the right kind of person who's into food hygiene and action movies.Despite it's bright toy-like colour scheme (which is probably a good thing) it's actually quite solidly built and klunks rather than clicks. I don't doubt that there will be knock-off salt guns very soon, but this one could well actually be worth the extra to buy an original branded product.

I swear I managed to get to a point where flies actively avoided my house, as word must have got around the fly community that a merciless assassin was waiting for them.Also, yes, it does sting if you shoot yourself.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 July 2023Verified Purchase
Seen this for a while, thought that it was a bit pricey but after spending money on UV electric shock lights and electric tennis racket things that always seem to break, I pulled the trigger on this, and it’s definitely not a toy. The spring has some real strength to it, and the salt does a good job. For me I’ve found that you can shoot a fly from a fair distance. But it only really disorientates the fly, or knocks it to the floor, so usually a second much closer shot required, but…I eliminated a good number of flys within a minute, leaving the kitchen bug free, albeit little bits of salt on the sides, but as the Mrs says, you kills them, I’ll clean the salt…and the kids like to use it too, win win

I had been needing a new mouse for some time after my old one broke, I was looking for good mouse’s and stumbled upon the Logitech G502. The shape and design of the mouse is what had originally caught my eye, the feel of the mouse in your hand is amazing and the added weights also make certain games so much more easier. It has a scroll wheel feature where you can either have it scroll really fast or have controlled scrolling. The mouse has a LOT of buttons and can be overwhelming at first but you can use Logitech’s software to change the actions of the buttons and they work really well. The only issue I have with it is one of the buttons on the side which my thumb presses too much and messes certain things up however you can bind it to have no action.

I've set up profiles for gaming, research, idle browsing etc. Adding macros to the key bindings is very helpful. The scroll wheel is very good on both modes (continuous and step-wise scroll). I like my mouse to have a heavier feel, and adding the extra weights is perfect. All the buttons are positioned well. If my hand was smaller or bigger, the button positions might feel a little off.

Other mouse that failed on me in under a year!This mouse actually has configurable weights that can be added or removed to suit, which was exactly what I was looking for as I'm not a fan of mice that feel like they're made of balsa wood.I use it for productivity work all day long and also some gaming, totalling about 12 hours a day, 5 days a week.It has configurable DPI ranging from 100 to 25,600 DPI, with buttons on the top to step up and down whatever configurable DPI values you may have set (those buttons can be disabled so you don't inadvertently click them during use if you don't want that functionality).It works out of the box, and can be set from the Windows mouse settings (including light cycling) but can also be re-configured more fully with any of the buttons being programmed or disabled with the free Logitech software that can be downloaded.It appears to have a multitude of profiles that can be set for various games if required allowing you to set various DPI values or different button assignments, and it can scan your system for Games or you can add profiles manually.As its not wireless and probably no longer considered to be state of the art, it can be bought for a reasonable price. I paid £34.99 for mine in Jan 2024.I will update this review if it fails in any way shape or form.

 This is a great mouse to use for gaming, it’s got additional weights you can add at the bottom which I find to be quite helpful since I kinda have shaky hands. Adding the weights helps stabilise movement when I’m playing. You can customise the lights on settings to whatever and how bright you want. Clicking the mouse is kind of sensitive for me since it’s my first time playing on mouse and key which I have to get used to but it’s pretty comfortable to grip on.

It's crazy how fluid everything is with iOS 16 and the promotion display.The cameras are huge. The camera quality is great, shooting raw at 48MP does take a lot of space ~80MB per picture but the detail is insane. They've greatly improved the photo quality in the dark. One thing that I really like about iPhones is how quick they can take and process pictures after you press the button. They've also improved the front cameras significantly compared to last year everything looks more crisp.Battery life is really good as well, I'm not so sure as of yet how much the always on display is affecting battery life so far but I've turned mine off.Overall I love this phone!

I upgraded from a six-year-old iPhone 8. So I can see the evolutionary developments in this phone. It’s solid, heavy and built like a tank. Very fast processing and an amazing camera. I was slightly disappointed with the battery, however. My old phone would drop to 20% by mid afternoon and this one drops to the same level by mid evening. So it needed a top up. I was hoping for it to last longer. But overall I am happy with the phone. I’m sure there are some ‘tips and tricks’ online to make the battery last longer!

They do work but only 50% of the time!A lot depends on what wraps you use and what you put in them, Asdas own brand of wraps works quite well.I had visions of making wraps with fillings like Cornish Pasties and heating them up in an air fryer while I'm out in my campervan, you will need a big air fryer and you would need to handle the wrap like an unexploded bomb, they're very delicate and pop open sometimes.If they were £5 I'd say they were brilliant but not for nearly £20.Buy pita pockets from your supermarket.

Game changer
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 March 2024Item Package Quantity: 1Verified Purchase
Husband could never fold his wraps properly, usually ended up using a knife & fork because they fell apart. The Crimpit is a real game changer, it crimps the edges of the wrap together, so you end up with a pasty or half moon shaped, perfectly sealed wrap. There are so many things that can be used in the Crimpit apart from wraps. There is even a Facebook group where people give new, tested ideas for fillings. The only drawback is that the whole of the Crimpit is plastic, I’m not sure if this is the only material that would work and keep it as cheap as it is, but the Crimpit will be around a long time after I’m gone!

Ultimate is a fitting subtitle
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 January 2019Platform For Display: Nintendo SwitchEdition: UltimateVerified Purchase
As one of the few Wii U owners out there, I was concerned when Super Smash Bros Ultimate appeared to be an enhanced version of the previous game, with little in the way of new content, when it was revealed in March 2018. This concern slowly turned into excitement and enthusiasm as the game neared release and more content was shown off.Sure there are less newcomers than ever, but everyone from the previous games has returned, with some even feeling new after recieving asthetic and gameplay changes. The new characters that are introduced are all unique and exciting, with my favourite surprisingly being Incineroar. The echo fighters add some welcome variety and when you're playing they may as well be 'real' fighters; they also make the character select screen even more ridiculous, which I'm all for.I'm less pleased with the stage selection; there is a crazy amount of them, but lots are carried over from the Wii u version. It's worth noting that every stage has had a major visual overhaul, so some older stages may as well be new; a lot of stages were new to me (I only owned Wii U and brawl) too, but there is a distinct lack of stage representation for games released after smash Wii u, such as super Mario 3d world and Pokémon sun and moon. Its also a shame that some characters only have one stage, with mega Man and Simon/Richter being standouts - there is so much music for these series in particular but I rarely listen to it when it's only available on one stage each.Speaking of the music, this game has an incredible soundtrack (it's perfect when writing a report, for you students out there), I immediately changed the sound options to around 80% background music, 20% voice and SFX, so take that as you will.In fact, the game's presentation as a whole is way better than any previous game, it runs perfectly at 1080p 60fps, dropping to 720p 60fps in handheld, and never drops frames even in 8 player mode. This is impressive from a technical standpoint and makes the crazier options like stage morph fully enjoyable without compromise.World of light is a fun, if overly long single player mode. It takes around 40 hours to finish, I managed it in about 30 as I was rushing through. It's quite repetitive but is fun in short bursts and provides a lot of content for a side mode. Don't expect a story or subspace style cutscenes though, these are not present at all except for the introduction shown in trailers and some incredibly generic cut scenes at the end. I would recommend finishing the mode though as the finale is pretty great, and you unlock some music for doing it.Spirits add a good amount of wackiness to the proceedings, though I have yet to use them in multiplayer. The spirit board is fun for quick gameplay sessions and the challenges give some direction to single player after completing the story. Classic mode is fun for once and is worth completing with multiple characters.So. Multiplayer is the core of any Smash bros game. How does it stack up? Well as you may have noticed, this review has a 5 star rating despite the negatives I already mentioned. The multiplayer is so good that even with it's flaws, this game still deserves five stars. The game allows 1-8 players in it's main mode which can be a mix of real, CPU and amiibo participants. The number of options and the ability to save rulesets is amazing and way better than anything else that the series has ever done. For example, I created 'pokemon mode' where the only items were master balls, the stages we're randomly chosen from all the Pokemon stages and it uses stamina rules.Aside from the infinitely customisable smash mode, the squad strike mode adds a fun new twist, where you go through multiple characters in a single battle. This has most of the options from smash mode, plus additional ones to, for example, start a new battle after each character is taken out. Smashdown is another great new mode where you work your way through the roster, each character disappearing after being used until you're forced to use a character you're bad at, so pick wisely!Ultimate has the best online in the series. I never managed to play brawl online and Wii u was a slow laggy mess, so it's not hard to improve, but perfect matches 90% of the time was not something I expected, especially over WiFi. Even when there is lag, the game just pauses until it catches up rather than going into slideshow mode. I don't know how good it is for high level play as I am not a pro at smash by any means, but the frame rate is perfect and input lag is minimal so it should be ok.In conclusion, there is a few things I don't like about this game. It has the least new of any game in the series besides melee and 64, it cuts content like the home run contest and break the targets, it has a fun but repetitive single player mode. But it is clear that the focus was on quality over quantity: Stellar presentation with amazing graphics, performance, music and menus. Fantastic multiplayer with a crazy amount of customisation and the perfect infusion of chaos when required. Great new characters, with major improvements to existing ones. A ridiculously large amount of stages with every single one being their best iteration yet. This is absolutely the ultimate 'Super Smash Bros' game, and you can play it on the bus!

Great game!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 August 2023Platform For Display: Nintendo SwitchEdition: UltimateVerified Purchase
My 7 year old daughter used her birthday money to purchase Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, which initially raised concerns due to its age rating and perceived difficulty level. However, as a gamer myself who researched the game extensively through reviews and gameplay videos, I ultimately found that the age rating was not a significant issue. While the game does involve fighting, it's presented in a delightful, cartoony, and slapstick manner, devoid of any graphic or gory elements. Remember, it's essential to assess a game's appropriateness for your child, as every child is unique.My second concern regarding the game's difficulty was something I couldn't determine beforehand. Nonetheless, my daughter was confident that she could handle it, and after purchasing it, she proved herself right. In just a few battles, she became a skilled player, demonstrating that every child's abilities and preferences differ. Therefore, it's crucial to make informed decisions based on your child's gaming experience.In conclusion, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate offers incredible fun and is remarkably easy to grasp, especially the basics. Additionally, the game provides an option to automatically adjust the difficulty level, ensuring a balanced playing field when facing opponents of varying skill levels. I highly recommend this game for its entertainment value and adaptability.

Brilliant Game if infuriating at times
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2020Platform For Display: Nintendo SwitchEdition: UltimateVerified Purchase
I bought this game as a huge fan of the Smash Bros games - ever since the original on the N64.This game is incredible. All the characters and stages from previous games, with an interesting new Adventure mode that never seems to end.It has the Classic Smash mode for old players like myself, which is great, and the characters do not take too long to unlock in their entirety.My only issue with this game is the Special Stipulation matches (most often found in the aforementioned Adventure Mode). While these in themselves are interesting and varied, the scope of the difficulty is something else. AIs can be seen constantly spamming attacks over and over, which is frustrating in any fighting game, and some of these challenges are beyond ridiculous. I consider myself a reasonably good player most of the time, but these challenges can be extremely unbalanced at times and can result in a lot of cursing and shouting to say the least. And that's only on the Normal difficulty setting. I daren't even attempt Hard mode.On the whole, I still love this game. It is great to play, and the sense of nostalgia I get from playing on some of the older stages can be quite shocking in just how nostalgic it is.I fully recommend buying this if you are a fan of the series, or even new to it. Just, my only advice is, unless you're an absolute masochist like myself, maybe play through the Adventure mode on Easy!

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2010Verified Purchase
I was a bit disappointed in the beginning that it wasn't the original (US version) but one the other hand, Monopoly is still great fun. You can play for hours and you will most likely forget what's the time. I played last time with 3 players and it took 3 hours to finish the game. Next time I will try with max players because that's more fun :)One thing which I don't really like about it, is that the board is folding in 4 which is making the game not so durable in my opinion. The old one that I used to have, was the original one, and you could fold it in 2 and it was a bit better made.But overall: Good job and nice fun!

It also has a good inbuilt banker, i.e. slots for the cards and money to make it all easier. The speed die is a good extra that adds another layer to the game, which can be used if players wanted to.

I took a long time to decide whether it would be worth getting on of these. I can say with complete confidence it is 100% worth the money! I'll summarise below :Pros - keeps baby amused, excellent for getting little jobs done, very safe, fun, lots of different toys, good value for money, baby loves it (he jumps around like crazy!) and it's very colourful. I've had friends babies in it very safely who have been a similar size to my son. Can be changed size to suit babies height.Cons - very large, worth an investment, can only be used for a short time of baby's development, we already have someone to pass it onto!I love it, it allows me to get dishes done, lie on sofa in a tired and sorry state or just to put him down for 10 minutes instead of lying him down. It is an investment and be prepared for the amount of room it takes up but it's for such a short time, would say it is worth every penny !

🕷️😂 ""Miles Morales: The Web-Slinging Hero My Love Life Never Knew It Needed!"" 😂🕷️
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024Platform: PS5Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
So, there I was, embracing my inner Miles Morales with Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales on the PS5. As a grown adult, swinging through virtual New York never felt so right – or so hilariously wrong.Upon opening the package, it was like unwrapping a birthday present from the universe. The anticipation was killing me, much like Miles getting zapped by his newfound powers. The game promised stunning visuals, fast loading, adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, and even Tempest 3D AudioTech. My expectations were higher than Spidey on a skyscraper.Now, why did I choose this game? Because, in the immortal words of Uncle Ben, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" I needed a responsibility, and by that, I mean hours of avoiding actual responsibilities. What I didn't anticipate was how this game would become the unexpected hero of my social life.Imagine this: a date night, with Miles Morales as our third wheel. The stunning visuals and fast loading times turned what was supposed to be a chill gaming session into a high-octane, action-packed adventure. The adaptive triggers made every web-sling feel like an interactive lesson in flirtation. I'd pull back the trigger, release, and hope for a positive response – both in the game and across the table.Embarrassment #1: The haptic feedback proved too immersive during an intense boss battle. My controller went wild, and in my panic, I knocked over my date's drink, creating a real-life 'Venom Blast' moment. Who knew gaming could be this electrifying?Feeling emboldened by my dating fiasco, I decided to introduce the game to my parents. They were less impressed by the stunning visuals and more concerned about me getting a job. But hey, at least the Tempest 3D AudioTech made them feel like they were in the middle of a superhero showdown, right?Work took an unexpected turn when my boss caught me web-swinging in the virtual streets instead of attending a virtual meeting. I blamed it on the ultra-high-speed SSD, but unfortunately, my excuse didn't swing. Let's just say my rise to superhero stardom cost me my day job. Thanks, Miles!However, despite the embarrassing situations, this game transformed my life. The stunning visuals made me appreciate the beauty in everything – even my reflection in the mirror. The adaptive triggers? Let's just say they're my secret weapon in the dating game. No, really, dates have become competitions of who can handle the most ""finger action.""And the Tempest 3D AudioTech? It's like ASMR for gamers. The sounds of the city immerse you in Miles' world, and sometimes I find myself standing on the balcony, pretending I'm overlooking Marvel's New York instead of my neighbor's questionable gardening choices.In conclusion, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales isn't just a game; it's a life-altering experience. It's the unexpected hero that swung into my heart, leaving chaos, laughter, and a trail of spiderwebs in its wake.Please appreciate this review with a thumbs up and a chuckle. Miles Morales may be the hero we need, but a good laugh is the real superpower. 🕷️😂

Visually stunning, great to play. Story could be longer.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2020Platform: PS5Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
So after receiving my PS5 last Thursday I was very eager to play this as I am a massive Spider-Man fan and have battled my way through New York on more then one occasion. This game first of all loads up incredibly quick! After doing the initial install which was around 40GB, from pressing the load up button I was in and playing the game in around 10 seconds! there was no messing about. I tested how quick it was to jump from game to game and quick access between games meant I could be playing Astro Bot trying to beat friends scores and then when I wanted to swing back into New York it took about 5-6 seconds to be back in and swinging!! I was thoroughly impressed. Running on PS5 graphics needless to say it looks stunning especially when running this in 4K. It does have enabled ray tracing which is incredible you can see every reflection even in Spider-Man's armour it really is fantastic software. That being said this is only enabled when running 30fps. you can run in 60fps but ray tracing does not work in this mode but you do have the option to change this at any time. I loved the story to this however I feel it should have been longer... and wasnt nearly enough Boss battles... compared to older games it did feel short in comparison and I really think it will benefit from DLC as I did manage to 100% Platinum this game in 3 days total alongside working etc. Overall very good game just could have been longer. 8 out of 10 from me.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2024Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
I have bought a number of these, the most recent for a colleague. He had two new LG 27"" monitors and we needed to give him good access to them. This stand is the perfect solution.It is quick and easy to assemble, and unlike many others the VESA mount is separate to the stand. This means that you can fit it to the monitor after fitting the stand to the desk, and then simply slot each monitor into place. It is almost limitlessly adjustable, even allowing individual adjustments to monitor height via a screw on the mounts, and comes complete with cable management clips as well, one of which has special holders for the two allen keys provided to make adjustments.They seem to have thought of pretty much everything. On my desk next to the one this is installed on I have the larger version that can handle my 32 inch screens. That is just as good, and is a key reason that we bought the 27"" version.So, overall, a really good product at a sensible price that does a great job.

I recently purchased the BONTEC Dual Monitor Stand for my home office, and I couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase. As someone who spends long hours in front of the computer, having a comfortable and ergonomic setup is essential for my productivity and overall well-being. This monitor stand has exceeded all my expectations.First and foremost, the build quality is exceptional. The stand feels sturdy and durable, providing a stable base for my two 24-inch monitors. Installation was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions and included hardware. Within minutes, I had both monitors securely mounted and adjusted to the perfect height and angle.One of the standout features of this stand is its flexibility. With adjustable arms, tilt, swivel, and rotation capabilities, I can easily customize the position of each monitor to suit my preferences. Whether I'm working on a project, watching videos, or gaming, I can effortlessly switch between landscape and portrait orientations with a simple rotation.Moreover, the ergonomic design has made a noticeable difference in my comfort level during long work sessions. By elevating the monitors to eye level and reducing neck strain, this stand has helped me maintain better posture and avoid discomfort.Another aspect worth mentioning is the compatibility with VESA mounting standards. My monitors fit perfectly onto the stand without any issues, thanks to the VESA 75/100 support.In terms of aesthetics, the sleek and modern design of the stand complements my workspace beautifully. It not only enhances the overall look of my desk but also maximizes valuable desk space by lifting the monitors off the surface.Overall, I highly recommend the BONTEC Dual Monitor Stand to anyone in need of a reliable and versatile solution for their dual monitor setup. It's well-built, easy to install, and offers unparalleled adjustability and comfort. Whether you're a professional working from home or a gaming enthusiast, this stand will undoubtedly enhance your computing experience. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!

A decent and affordable option
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 March 2024Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
It works well overall but is a bit fiddly to assemble and adjust. It's also difficult to get both monitors perfectly level. There are ways to realign them with allen Keys but so far my monitors, despite both being the exact same model and size, refuse to fully align perfectly. It's a minor issue admittedly but anyone with OCD won't be fully happy.That aside, this is really cheap compared to other similar products and overall I'm happy with how it works. It has removed the bulky monitor bases from my desk, freed up a lot of space and allowed me to sit my MacBook on the desk under the monitors, which wasn't possible before. So it solves problems such as that extremely well and allows you to tailor your workspace exactly as you need it.

Great addition to any desk!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2024Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
So, there isn't an awful lot to say since its a very basic item however, I'll make sure to describe it to the best possible.Easy to Assemble? Quite, however, there was some points where the bolts were extremely tight and was a little worrying to adjust as I didn't want it to snap. Over all, the Assemble couldn't have been easier though, I had a 27"" and a 24"" monitor to strap onto the VESA mounts and it was extremely easy even for one person assembly. I would probably recommend to get another person to help if you can as it will make it must easier. I took maybe 20 minutes to set up? So it probably could have been a 10 - 15 minute job if someone was helping hold different parts and setting up the VESA mounts at the same time.Sturdiness, its been around 1 / 2 months since its been set up and its been great. The kit itself seems very well made considering the purchased price. I wasn't too sure if it was going to hold up since the 24"" monitor is a little weighty but it is holding it quite well.Stability wise, the monitors are nice and firm with no rattling at all. Easy to adjust with the A Keys being attached to the Mount.For the price, I don't think I could have got anything better and it could honestly have been a £50 - £60 product if not more. Paying £28 was a steal and I would recommend this to anyone looking to mount their monitors.

The only slight snag is you start to remember what's on the cards once you've played it a few times, which makes it easier to guess, but that's inevitable with any board game I suppose. Definitely worth a purchase.

The original Articulate is challenging for kids as they don’t know most of the people but with this box you can play the game and get everyone involved on equal terms.  We successfully used the kids pack alongside the adults pack on the adults board and everyone was happy and involved.  Articulate is alsoa very simple game to pick up which is KEY at Christmas!!

We have played this a few times, and people to our home have asked to borrow it which says all you need it to.We have also played it with just 2 or 3 players where we can't make teams so we all act as each others team to move our counter round the board.  It has been just as fun to play it this way as it has been in a team.  Nobody tried to sabotage anyones game as it was just too much fun to try to work out what they were trying to get us to guess!Definitey recommend - old, young, small groups, large groups.  Anyone!

Makers of games everywhere must be kicking themselves that they didn't come up with this idea first - I know I am, and I don't even make games.This is, quite simply, the only game I've ever played that has had me in so much uncontrollable laughter that I've spat my wine out, cried with hysterical laughter, fallen off my chair, had a near escape in not making it to the toilet in time, and is the first game to ask when I last took a dump.  Seriously, the player that goes first is the person who last took a dump - nothing like poo-talk to provide a dinner party ice-breaker.I've noticed that some of the reviewers that have purchased the game have been ""shocked"" and ""horrified"" by some of the answers on the cards.  My response to you is: if you'd bothered to read the official game description and looked at the example cards provided, you could have avoided your delicate sense of humours taking a beating.It's a simple idea - one player reads out a sentence on a black card, leaving one (or in some cases two) word blank.  Each player has ten white cards, each displaying a different word/object/person's name and you can use any one of your cards to fill in the blank.  The player who read out the sentence then collects the other players' chosen cards and reads the sentence aloud, each time with a different chosen card - the winner of each round is decided by the player who's reading the sentence aloud and whichever they think is funner.  The rules are so simple that you can even continue playing when you're absolutely mullered and can barely speak.  We found that we didn't even care about keeping score - the comedy was reward enough!Yes, indeed, the answers provided on some of the cards are ""shocking"" (their words, not mine - I just think it's funny), such as 'smegma', 'German dungeon porn', 'penis breath', 'glory holes' and 'Emma Watson' (there are way worse ones, but I have no idea what Amazon is willing to publish in a review - plus, that would take the genuine shock-factor away).  However, there are also completely benign answers, such as 'crippling debt', 'laying an egg' and 'hormone injections'.Believe me when I tell you that it doesn't matter whether the cards are shocking or not, it's whatever works in the sentence you're provided, and in actual fact, some of the funniest ones have been the most boring of answers - you'll find yourself holding back your shockers until just.....the......right......time.If you're of a sensitive nature, simply don't buy the game - you won't enjoy it.  And it might make you cry.I personally love the fact that the makers of this game have picked up on one very quintessentially British key point: we laugh in the face of adversity and at the most inappropriate times.  It's what makes us British and what helps the majority of us get through the tough times - it's our edge over the rest of the world.This game will only work if you're playing it with like-minded individuals who can't be shocked, aren't of a nervous or sensitive disposition, and it also helps to drink a lot of wine - it just gets funnier.I can't believe people have said they got bored of it after a while - firstly, there are literally thousands of possibly combinations of words and sentences, plus the company have produced expansions packs of cards so that you can keep the game going.  And if you really switched your brain on, you could make up your own cards - for FREE.My advice to people everywhere is: buck up, buy this game, sink a bottle of wine and play it with some easy-going friends who aren't easily offended.  It makes for the best dinner party you'll ever have.One final note to the reviewers who said (and I'm paraphrasing because I stand to finish reading them) ""I bought this game for my son's/daughter's birthday party and was horrified"" etc - the game is marked as not suitable for people under the age of 17 - read your product descriptions and check the reviews before buying stuff for your kids.End of - enjoy the game :-)

Great Quality and usability - at a price
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2023Style Name: H10 V1Verified Purchase
I had a Garmin VIRB HD camera for along time and used it a lot. I wanted to get an upgrade and after a lot of thought decided that I would pay the money for a GoPro vs a much cheaper ""clone"". I am glad I did - there is no doubt that picture quality, image stabilisation etc are excellent. As a user who just puts it on the bike and records it's excellent (in 4K especially). The UI via the touch screen is fine for what I want. I have not really used many modes other than 4K (uses battery fast) or 1080p which gives better battery life. I've turned off the the smaller front screen as I don't need it.At 4K the battery lasts around 40 minutes tops so it's a bit limiting to collect more footage without additional batteries. I am using a 128Gb SD card that records about 10 batteries worth of footage at least.On the downside - there's no basic ""GoPro Basic Windows Video Editor"" any more - connectivity is via the mobile App and my phone isn't good enough (either performance or WiFi speed) to make this worth considering. So I use an old fashioned USB cable to move video off - and the connection to a PC is flaky - I often have to ""reset the connectivity"" on the camera to get USB to work.As above, battery life is quite limiting so I have had to buy some spares to extend the recording timeBut there is no doubt why people use these cameras - compact, and high image quality and having got one myself I don't regret the purchase and would buy again

I bought this primarily for snorkeling on holiday.  Ionly  got an hour or so's use out of it.  I wasn't that impressed with the photo quality, but the videos came out ok above and below water.  Unfortunately, when I tried to use it the next day it wouldn't switch on and found the GoPro was SERIOUSLY hot while still switched off!  I took the battery out to cool off, then tried recharging it, but the overheating started again and it still refused to switch on.  Looking through the reviews it definitely looks like you are entering a lottery with a GoPro!I contacted Amazon support online and they immediately agreed a return and refund, so I can't fault them.

These were my first pair of Apple AirPods. I was hesitant to buy them due to their high price, but have been delighted with them, and am pleased I opted for the Pros.As expected, the AirPods work flawlessly with my iPhone. They pair quickly and intelligently and don't need constant resetting like so many other Bluetooth devices. Your phone will also tell you the charge status of the AirPods, and lets you customise settings such as motion tracking and noise cancelling features.The sound quality is superb and easily rivals the many other professional earbuds and headphones I have tried over the years. The noise cancelling functions are incredible, providing an option to almost completely mask the noise of trains or planes, for example. During one flight, I put them in without listening to music, just so that the noise-cancelling function could reduce the cabin noise enough for me to get some sleep.I also like that you can control noise transparency, which is much safer when you are out in public; this lets you filter in actual sounds when needed, for example when turning your head to check for traffic, or when speaking to someone. It works brilliantly.The earbuds are very comfortable and at first I thought they would never fall out. After a few months of use, I would revise that by saying they can fall out when you get hot and sweaty, and seem to hold less well since I rinsed them under the tap, as advised.

I have found AirPods the most ergonomic of the earbud offerings and use them for phone (extensively), audiobook and music. There is a lot of emphasis across all kit on display quality for eyes but sound quality can be overlooked. The value of privacy and not disturbing other people means that comfort when used for long periods is also important.I moved up from AirPods to AirPod Pro after finding that the former tended to fall out when walking (regardless of cup fitting) and the greater sound quality was an incidental benefit.The first generation of the Pro have been excellent and I would probably not have upgraded but the holder and pods inside did not survive a cotton hot wash when left in a jeans pocket (don’t try this at home). I tried drying them by putting them in a bowl of rice but no luck.Generation 2 was imminent and I made do with a different make for a month. Although not inexpensive, the stand ins fell well short of AirPods in terms of comfort, staying in the ear, weight and simplicity of use. I had to refer to a manual because the design was not intuitive.AirPod 2 prompted an upgrade to my Iphone OS for full functionality (you can proceed without but don’t benefit from all the enhancements). Once done, pairing completed in seconds and a brief tour popped up explaining ‘on stalk’ controls.There are all sorts of jargon reviews about spatial sound field depth and so on. All I know is that, from recollection after a month’s gap, the sound quality and immersive sense was better. This could be partly the stand ins but I used them far less because they were not up to AirPod user friendliness. I used the pro 1 for a long time and I can identify a material improvement to an already good sound stage. Phone calls and audiobooks are not much of a challenge and to put the new generation through its paces I chose a few tracks that would test out bass, high notes, quiet and wall of sound music. To my ear, these very light earbuds are high quality hi fi and on a par with a Bose unit we use. The difference with the Pro 2 seems to be a sense of openness - more akin to listening to 3D sound versus an enclosed headphone experience.Noise cancellation - good in generation 1, it is dramatic for its ability to negate external sounds in the new incarnation. It also seems to be less artificial. Rather than a cotton wool effect, it is more as if external sounds are removed and that the degree of cancellation in some way takes account of the level of ambient noise rather than a blanket effect.There is no noticeable difference in size, weight or mass of the kit and the stalk seems to be much the same. One change is a further ear cup size, accommodating to a wider range of fitting needs.Most controls (volume, pause, skip) are available on the stalks. I have always found it easier to operate these from the phone and it took a degree of practice to test out ‘stalk control’. It works and may be useful for the gym and running.I think generation 1 AirPods were waterproof but not the charging case. Both are now certified water (rather than splash) proof. I wouldn’t risk them in a long boil wash again but a waterproof case reduces the need to safeguard it when out and about. Not tried them in the shower or swimming and will leave this to anyone prepared to risk new kit in the interests of reviewing.Charging is, as per previously, possible using a charging mat and the spec states markedly improved usage per charge - 6 hours listening/4.5 talk time for the AirPods and 30/24 for the case. Slightly less with spatial audio and head tracking (?! - think ‘cinema surround sound’).Important to note - AirPods can be used with non Mac devices but some of the advanced features are not available, requiring Mac OS.The one phenomenon that I will need to wait and see to know if it has been eliminated is ‘fade’. On all AirPods I have noticed after a while that phone callers report that my voice is fading out (random occurrence) for no accountable reason. I only notice this on calls, not listening and it seemed to be a function of the microphone and software because I could hear the caller fine. It was the only (and intermittent) issue I had with previous versions. I kept software up to date and the only other cause I have read up is ‘too many apps in use). iPhones don’t close apps and I have to periodically swipe and clear a dozen or so. Could be the issue and I have only discovered this as the possible culprit when looking for problems reported on line with generation 2. The only claimed problem was an apparently continued one - connectivity between multiple devices. I haven’t noticed this but I haven’t experienced a problem when switching between my Mac, IPad and phone or a Bluetooth enabled land line phone.And finally. All told I have probably spent 3 hours over the years searching for the case, which can easily get lost in pockets (thus the washing machine incident). The number of times I have been delayed going out or forced to take a call because I had misplaced them is legion. This has been solved by being able to ask the AirPod case to emit a ping to reveal where it is in hiding.Overall. I would have hesitated to buy these if I had not machine washed version 1 and then taken a backward step with another make. However, my subjective impression is that these are a significant step forward for an already good piece of kit. If you use AirPods on a daily basis for a fair while I consider that you will find these worthwhile the upgrade. Plenty are prepared to change smart phones at each launch (I usually wait three years) but to use an analogy, better tyres can improve driving experience for far less outlay than changing a car. AirPods support quite a lot of high end kit and the outlay enhances the overall utility of that ecosphere.

Amazing noise reduction and a significant improvement over the standard first-gen Airpods (non pro)
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2023Style Name: Lightning connectorVerified Purchase
Prior to getting these pro Airpods, I had the original standard first-generation Airpods.  Whilst they were really good, I did find that they easily came loose in my ears when walking.  These pros have a different design with silicone ear-pieces that ensure they fit snugly in your ears.  You get a few different size ear-pieces supplied and your Apple device will guide you through choose the appropriate size. The silicone earpieces help to ensure a good seal between your ear canal and the outside world.  The only downside though I found to this was a somewhat 'under water' feeling when you walk, amplifying the feeling of your footsteps in your head.  You do though get used to this quickly and so it wasn't a deal breaker for me. On the plus side though you do get a stunning frequency response, given the tiny size of the ear buds.  The bass goes deep, but it is never too strong or bloated. You can tweak the EQ settings on your device but I always prefer to listen on the flat setting.  The mid range is smooth and not too strident, the trebles are clean and overall the sound is comfortable and will suit a very wide range of musical genres.Now to the best bit!  The Airpod Pros feature noise cancellation over the standard Airpod first gen.  To be honest I was not expecting much from a pair of ear buds, especially after trying more expensive Bose noise-cancelling headphones, but was I wrong.  The noise cancellation on these is extremely impressive, so much so I have to sometimes turn it off to remind myself of my surroundings.  On that note though Apple have included a clever transparency mode which allows you to hear some outside sound through the earpieces, it's all very clever and adapts to your surroundings.  Another smart feature is spatial audio.  This essentially broadens the soundstage of a stereo sound source, adding subtle ambience and creating a much bigger stereo field - as if you were listening to speakers in a room.  You can also choose how this tracks your head movements, in other words if you turn your head side-to-side the sound source remains in the same position in 3D space, further adding to the speakers-in-a-room effect.Other features include a speaker built into the charging case which can help you locate it from your phone (by emitting a sound).  There's a tiny LED on the case to show when it's charging, which you can do either from Lightning or Wireless.  Setting these up with an Apple device is a piece of cake, and there is also some clever camera scanning features in the device set up to measure your ear profiles and help you get the most from them.In terms of running times, you get around 5 hrs of run time from the buds without putting them back in the charging case. They can also function as a hands-free microphone for calls, which might drop the usage time by an hour or so. The case itself charges from a lightning cable, although the latest models have USB-C charging.  You can check the state of charge remaining on your Apple device and with a fully charged case, you should get up to 30 hrs of run time from the buds.I forgot to also mention the gesture control on the ear buds.  Whilst I don't tend to use this feature (using either the phone or my Apple watch instead)  you can swipe the stem of the buds to adjust volume, press it to play or pause or answer a call, or hold it to change the active noise cancellation and transparency mode.  Other functions include double press the stems to skip forwards, and triple press to skip back a track.Overall these are the best ear buds I have ever owned.  You get what you pay for.

Sometimes products have the specs but in use the are hard to live with or buggy. This isn’t that! You can really tell it’s a very mature product with all the bugs ironed out, both in camera and app.Firstly, I got this not the Osmo action because this has H265 and the Osmo doesn’t and it is a serious thing for IQNow, first action cam but about my hundredth camera.So..slickness is just wow - want to take a photo underwater ? Set a three second timer with the shortcut. Get near the surface and shout “GoPro take a photo “ Then in you goWant to turn it on when you’re about to start your run on your bike? Just call” GoPro start recording. “Worried about your data? It automatically uploads to the GoPro cloud when you charge it.  This will save everything at full quality forever, however many GB that is, for £5 pm, plus you’re insured against accidental  breakage too.Video is very sharp. It will shoot RAW. It’s fast and responsive and tough , of course.The stabilisation is completely incredible. I strapped mine to my dog and the footage was perfect....Audio really not bad at all. I have proper mics etc etc but the surround effect you get with this is really impressive. If you’re by a a stream you can hear the voices fine but also know they’re by running water.The app is flawless. Control the camera and set framing? No problemo ( which by the way means you didn’t need the Osmo action’s front facing screen anyway) Update all settings? Check footage? Editing? Yep all in the appThe only thing that hasn’t been very very impressive with this setup is the battery life. I have three batteries and I need them to go out for a two hour adventure with the children and the dog.  If you had a heavy day of filming planned you really might need half a dozen batteries ready. They’re cheap enough but it is the first accessory you need to buy. Speaking of accessories there are tonnes of really great accessories for the GoPro available. I bought a cheap £15 kit that had a chest strap, a head strap and a tripod mount and they’re all great.I’m delighted with this camera. The footage is great. There’s lots of shooting options both for photo and video. The ecosystem is very mature and squared away.A great purchase and I’m so taken by the usefulness of action cameras I’ll likely pick up another for shooting another angle.

My last GoPro was a Hero 3 which to be honest got used a few times then sat in a drawer. This was because I found it a chore to keep putting in the case and just found using it cumbersome.I wanted a camera for family bike rides and paddle boarding and GoPro 8 was the only one that fitted my budget with a decent spec.Used on bike and video image stabilisation it good and works well and on a few paddle boarding trips. What I also like about the new GoPros is the built in mounting brackets, it’s waterproof as a bare unit and that you do not need an additional case for it. Very please with the picture and video quality.This camera does not sit in the drawer and is so easy to use although like Alexa the voice commands are sometimes ignored!

Super impressed for MTB footage
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 September 2021Style Name: Base PackageVerified Purchase
I've previously had a Crosstour budget action cam (and a very old GoPro many years ago). The difference in image quality and stabilisation between the budget Crosstour and the GP8 is light and day. In fairness the Crosstour only cost around 20% of the GP8 but there really is no comparison.I use the GP8 mainly for mountain bike trails recording. Not just gravelly fire roads but proper dropoffs and rooty rough trails. I shoot in 4K 30 fps using Superview.  Superview is perfect and really takes you into the trails and gives a great feel to the trails. The stabilisation takes away all the jittery effects  whilst not ironing out the proper feel and flow.I've only got the single battery that it came with and that has been sufficient so far. However, I recognise I will need to purchase additional batteries and these do seem pretty expensive. I do have a range of attachments and accessories that came with the Crosstour and they work well with the GP8.Bottom line, I'm very impressed and think the GP8 hits the sweet spot in terms of price versus performance.

Gopro Black 8 good but not good enough !
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 May 2020Style Name: Base PackageVerified Purchase
Great image stabilisation and super quality footage. Saying that Its a Gopro so wouldn’t expect anything else.Bad bits the battery life is about an hour and 15 mins using activity 2.7 | 60 | S and these batteries are fiddly to remove. Though there are replacement back up batteries available so this is a must.  Transferring your footage is very time consuming using wireless mode. I mainly use an Ipad so card transfer not applicable. I find editing using the Gopro App is also mind numbingly clunky.  Ok Quik the App is a handy one minute creator but for longer videos not really what I want. There used to be a much better App seemingly called Gopro studio which on research was better. They dropped it in favour of the new Gopro App!The lens looks like it might scratch but is non replaceable. Seemingly its gorilla glass or similar break/scratch resistant material however my Iphone said this and its a mess. So not confident this will last.  !!!The Go Pro cloud is a joke. The app keeps asking me to resubscribe for my free trial which it recognises as reducing ( now finished and I have not used it once. And if I try to re subscribe  but wont let me go any further. Gopro support are non responsive!Basically I do like the camera but would I buy if I knew this? Probably not.Get your act together GoPro folks will stray if this is your future plan.

Excellent Air Fryer and Oven
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 August 2023Style Name: Dual Basket Air FryerVerified Purchase
If you have not used this type of device before, they are a lot more than a fryer, they are actually an oven. They have been around for over 30 years, it is only recent tech advances and cost of energy and cost of oil which have made these trendy. They are esseentially a high power fan type oven.They cook a lot quicker than a conventional oven because its a small space to heat and the fan creates a lot of air flow. You can also reduce the amt of oil you use.For example, roast potatoes cook, depending on how large you cut them from 10 to 20 mins. Which is a big saving on the electric. When you by an air fryer, buy an oil sprayer as you will often use a few pumps of oil. This makes things crispy. I brought one from Amazon. When you do buy a spray make sure it is for oil, I wated money on a few which could not handle veg oil.This actual device, has some great features, it has lots of presets which are useful guides, like other devices of this kind, I own 2 air fryer ovens, this bin style and one which is more like a normal oven and has a rotisery.This has 2 advanced options which is match cooking, used when cooking things which need the same time and temp in both bins. Also match finish.  You set the temp and time for each bin,  and press this button they will finish cooking at the same time, which is really handy.Something else about a bin style fryer, you need to take the tray out and give it a shake from time to time, which you may think is a pain. In reality its not. The cooking time is so much shorter than a normal oven  its no big deal to pull out the tray and shake it. Im normally preparing and cooking other parts of the meal whilst the oven is cooking so Im in the kitchen anyway.The build quality feels good, I did look around in shops before buying some of the cheaper ones do not feel they will last very long. This one feels good.Something else to check is the quality of the non stick. That is key, according to a CH4 documentory I watched about air fryers. They did a test on many models and this one rated very highly. On the cheaper ones the non stick often peels off after only  a short time and use. This one looks to have a good quality of non stick, thats by observation and what the test said in the documentory.The cheapers are ok, but think about how long you want them to last and how often you use them. The mid price may be better value for money.Another thing about air fryers is they cook so quickly and are so easy to use, I find my self using it a lot more than I would have ever used a normal oven. In many ways its taking over from the microwave. Especially when reheating things, i.e. left over pizza comes out nice and cruncy rather than the limp slice when heated in a mirco wave.This has a preheat button which is excellent and further reduces cooking time and makes the food cook better. Preheating a normal oven is always a good idea but takes in mine, 10 mins. This air oven preheats up to 180C in 3 mins which is a lot more convienient and costs a lot less.I cannot stress enough but the reduced cooking times and the money you save on oil and elec.When cooking normally you would use a good glug of oil for roast veg, in this fryer a few pumps of the spray is all you need. Which also means its better for your health.I did look at the ninja in a real shop and compared the 2. The ninja you appear to be paying a lot for the name. The quality did not feel as good as this device.I would also reccomend, buying some liner trays, again I brough them on Amazon they are made from a type of paper and makes cleaning very easy. Ive been warned not to use normal baking or waxed paper in an air fryer as it may fly up in the air flow and is a fire risk. This warning applies to all air ovens/fryers.I also brought a wire rack on Amazon which lets be double decker things. The one I brought was around £14 is has a stand frame and also a 2nd frame with 4 skewers. It works well for kebabs etc.Overall this is a great device and is priced well for what it is. As I said I did look at some which cost a lot more and decided on this one.

I decided to join the Air Fryer revolution and by chance came across this one. I have to say that I am so impressed with it. Food cooks quicker and is really tasty. The time and energy cost it saves is fantastic. Since I've purchased this, it's pretty much the only appliance I use, I've cooked frozen things like chicken fillets, hash browns etc, fresh meat like steak, pork belly, lamb chops and sausages, and even things like cheese on toast, everything comes out amazing! the windows are great too so I can keep an eye on things. the presets are nice but timings are way off, I just use them as a guide and adjust the temp and time before cooking. Only thing is that you need to turn things over half way through but I don't see that as much of a problem. I don't know how I lived without one! Excellent price aswell!

Convenient but not worth the hype
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 February 2024Style Name: Eco Dual BasketVerified Purchase
My previous experience of air fryers was not pleasant, as a support worker for a disabled man, who insisted on everything being cooked in the air fryer. I found it neither quicker, easier and disgusting to use as none of his other support workers cleaned it out after use, resulting in me wasting more time cleaning it before and after use.  For this reason I have avoided air fryers and put them down to being the latest fad but then I noticed that a few of my friends had them and as an ""empty nester"" I felt that putting the oven on just for me was both costly and wasteful.  So I spent hours in stores and online trying to work out which one would be best for me.  I thought I'd go small and cheap so that if I didn't use it I could pass it on to my daughter, and I didn't want to clutter up my kitchen with a useless gadget.  I decided on this model because it was half price and Tower seemed to have the widest range of options.  I also liked the idea of two different sized drawers, as I use the smaller one for things like bacon or warming pies and the larger one for cooking previously frozen cottage pies or lasagnes or for when I'm cooking for the family.  Like everybody else, first uses are a bit hit and miss and needs practice.  My first use was on sausages which were leathery and the mash went cold waiting for them to cook.  It is definitely quicker than using the oven but I can't say it's saved me any money in terms of electricity.  I've purchased silicone liners which are a big bonus as they are quick to rinse and I've only washed the actual drawers once or twice and they too are easy to rinse and wipe. I've also downloaded and oven - air fryer cooking convertor which as averted the timing disasters. What cooks well? Steak is really juicy, chips are crispy as are pastry products.  I haven't plucked up the courage to try baking a cake yet, as I don't want to waste time and ingredients on getting it wrong.  I think air fryer is a misnomer as it is an oven or grill.  It's better than the microwave becasue you can use metal containers but I wouldn't part with the microwave or my oven hob, although the rest of the oven is now pretty much redundant.  I've been using it 3-4 times a week for two months now and yes I have found it quick, easy and convenient, especially after coming in from work.  I hope this is a useful review, if, like me, you're dithering whether to join the masses and buy one.

I bought an air frier when they first came out and it really was awful; the food tasted like cardboard and was just awful. I went back to Actifry because it turns food slowly from start to finish meaning the food is evenly cooked. I bought this one because it has 2 drawers and I was told they had improved a lot. I have to say that this product is brilliant. So long as you shake your food halfway through you get perfect results every time.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 December 2012Pattern Name: singleStyle Name: 80 OHM (Studio)Verified Purchase
Music and, more importantly, sound quality is subjective to the listener therefore it is worthwhile explaining a little about my headphone/music history so that you may decide whether my experience will compare to yours. If you are a seasoned audiophile and you regularly use a set of Grado PS1000's as part of your sound make-up, then you might not agree with everything in this review entirelly. However, if like me, you are not a seasoned audiophile or someone who has spent thousands on headphone equipment over the years and paying £130 for a set of headphones is seen as ""pushing the boat out"", then this review may help is justifying your decision to do so. All of my previous earphone purchases have been floating around the £50 - £70 mark. I paid £60 for my current gaming headset (Sennheiser PC330) and my current portable in-ear earphones (Denon AH-C551). I mainly listen to music on my PC and I currently use a Fiio E10 DAC (Digital to Analogue Converter), which cost roughly £60 from Amazon. I mostly listen to rock music although I have quite a range of music genre's across my 400GB music library, including electronic, dance, metal, rap, blues and hardstyle. Artists include Rammstein, AC/DC, Velvet Revolver, Metallica, Stereophonics, Snoop Dogg, Deadmau5 and Headhunterz.So now on to the headphones themselves...ComfortOut of the box, the first thing that struck me was how comfy the soft, velour earpads looked. Coming from the Sennheiser PC330 ""on-ear"" headphones, the comfiness experienced by the Beyerdynamics was on a different level. The Beyerdynamics are considered ""over-the-ear"" headphones. This means that they completely envelope your ear and, at least in my case, your ear never actually touches the headphones (I would say I have bigger than average ears). The velour pads therefore clamp themselves against the side of your head although such is the softness of the pads, you would hardly notice them there. I have seen some reviews where people have complained of the headphones being too tight or uncomfortable. I don't know how these could possibly be considered anything but extremely comfy.Comfort Rating - 5/5Build QualityThe earphones are built using a combination of metal, plastic and velour. The cans are made of plastic, although seem to be pretty sturdy. There are companies online that will replace the plastic cans with wooden ones, although I don't quite understand why this is desirable. I would imagine wooden cans would add to the weight and therefore reduce how comfy they are but each to their own I suppose. The hinges which attach the cans to the headband are made of metal.One of the great features of these headphones is that almost every part of the headphones can easily be replaced. You can buy spare parts from Beyerdynamics directly or even look around on Amazon/eBay. I think the headphones look extremely durable and I seem to be backed up by other reviews online (There seems to be quite a large number of reviewers who claim you could ""through these down a hill"" and they would still work. I'm not sure if throwing a set of DT 770's down a hill has any benefits, but it is good to know that the option is always there!)Build Quality - 4/5Sound QualityI must admit, when I first received these headphones, I did not have access to my PC therefore I plugged them into my Galaxy S3 and was slightly disappointed. Although the sound was ""good"", it was pretty hard to justify spending £130 on. I hoped the improved sound from my Fiio E10 would make a difference. And it did....a whole lot.BassUsing Windows Media, I activated the TruBass enhancement and the bass response of the headphones almost blew me away. After a few hours of tinkering, I now have my media player set to WinAmp, I have customised the EQ a little (a little more emphasis on the bass) and have installed the Real Bass Exciter plug-in. I can honestly say that the only other times that I have heard (and felt) bass like this is when I have been at the front row of a rock concert. The really low frequecy basslines generate enough vibration within the earphones that it actually tickles your ears. COnsidering my ears never actually touch the earphones, that should give you an idea of just how explosive the bass can be. These are advertised as being able to re-produce sound as low as 5 Hz (much lower than the human ear can hear) and I honestly believe that. I had a 1000 watt amp and 12 inch subwoofer in my old car and even the bass there wasn't comparable to these.Mid RangeEven with my emphasis on the bass, I can still hear everything that is going on with the mid-range sounds. Vocals would normally fall in to this category and I can tell you that even though I am being blasted with extreme amounts of bass, the vocals manage to rise above this and are crisp and clear. I can honestly say that I have absolutely no negatives to describe on the mid-range sound quality.High-End RangeI had read previous reviews where the high-end has been described as a little harsh. I have been trying to find this harsh sound ever since I started listening to the earphones and I have yet to find this. It could be that because I have came from my Sennheiser PC330 headphones, where the high end can be a little ""screechy"", I am a little less sensitive to any ""screeching"" that the Beyers make. I could also be because I haven't been able to listen to these headphones on full volume, mainly due to the fact that I enjoy not being deaf. Honestly, I have the volume on these sitting at around 70% and there are absolutely no faults with the high-end sound reproduction.Sound Quality - 5/5OverallOverall, I'm going to give these headphones 5/5. Sure, nothing is perfect and if someone let me listen to their set of Ultrasone Edition 10 headphones, then my definition of perfection would likely change, but in the meantime, I am absolutely thrilled by the sound quality provided by these earphones. If I have any negatives, it would be the sound leakage. It isn't a problem for me as I only use them for personal listening whilst in the house but if you wanted to use these in public, be prepared to let everyone else listen as well. On that note, these are also not very portable. They come with a 3 metre non-detachable lead so it would be very difficult to prevent yourself from tripping up on it. They aren't marketed for being very portable though so if you buy them for that reason, then you really haven't researched enough. It would be like buying a sub-woofer and a set of PA speakers and then complaing that they are quite difficult to carry around with you.If, like me, you haven't spent as much as £130 on a pair of earphones and are reluctant to do so, all I can say is that I was in the same position and I can categorically state that the sound reproduction on these has absolutely rekindled by love affair with music. Do you enjoy music? Do you enjoy listening to music? Do you need earphones and have a spare £130? Press the Buy Now button.

Very pleased; impressive perfomance
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 April 2019Pattern Name: singleStyle Name: 80 OHM (Studio)Verified Purchase
TL;DR: The sound of the DT 770 Pro 80 ohm is very respectable. I find that, in general, the DTs can hold their own against the legendary Sennheiser HD 650, and even greatly surpass it in one respect: bass extension and ""wow"" factor.Build: These headphones look and feel very sturdy. The headband is a thick metal sheet that seems unlikely to snap, and the earcups are a solid and rugged plastic. The top of the headband is wrapped in a soft, leather-like material that looks and feels posh. Certainly the best build quality I've personally experienced in headphones!Comfort: These are very comfortable cans. They surround my ears completely without touching them, and the velour pads are very soft and nice on the skin. The noise isolation is good. The clamping pressure was a bit annoying at first, and I initially could hear a high-pitched ringing in my ears due to it, as well as hear my blood pumping in my ear sometimes, but both these annoyances went away after a couple days. Perhaps the headband became less stiff with use, or I got used to the pressure.Sound: Now, let me state that I do not believe in assessing headphone sound in isolation. I don't trust people's sonic memory, or my own for that matter. I think one must always compare something against a standard. Fortunately, I got Sennheiser HD 650s (which are reference-class headphones and some of the most well-regarded cans in the world) a couple months after getting the DT 770s, creating a suitable parameter for comparison.How I tested: My testing methodology was to:1- repeat the same section of a song over and over again, switching between both headphones as fast as I could (short-term sonic memory lasts only a few seconds). I did this for dozens of different songs.2- running each headphone on a separate Apple device (both have the same internal DAC and sound the same to my ears) so that headphone switching can happen as fast as possible (takes about 1 second on average), and3- matching the volume as closely as possible for the fairest comparison, since louder songs tend to sound better all else being equal.The DT 770s have surprisingly wide soundstage, considering they are closed-back, to the point that I don't notice much difference between both headphones' soundstage (pretty impressive considering we're comparing closed vs. open here).The DT 770s have considerably more satisfying bass. It's less accurate, sure, but it has more ""thump"" or ""oomph"" or however you wanna call it, being more fun to listen to.The DT 770s seem to have a noticeable boost in the high frequencies relative to the HD 650s. Everything sounds a little higher in pitch, like it was tuned slightly up, but not to the point of seeming inaccurate or annoying. The effect is minor and doesn't feel like it's doing something wrong, just different.Overall I am impressed with the DT 770s to the point I don't have any issue using it over the HD 650 (i.e. so as to not bother someone else in the room). With other headphones I would be bothered with the fact I'd not be getting the best sound quality, but with the DT 770s its so close that it doesn't matter.

I'm really happy with my Fire TV 4 (43"")! we upgraded from a very old 32"" smart TV and this feels SO much bigger!! Lol it's lovely and sleek with a barely-there bezel and easy to fit, elegant legs. The features are really intuitive, and it was so easy to set up (with smart phone in hand!). My only criticism is the default media player for playing from usb... I didn't expect it to play AVI files, as that's an old format now (& almost everything worth watching on a 4k TV comes in MP4 OR MKV these days!) BUT you literally can't manage subtitle Giles AT ALL (as in .srt files). Some downloads will play embedded subtitles but some don't (I haven't figured out which, or why, yet!) and although you can install VLC media play on it, you can't adjust the aspect ratio in VLC on fire?! So you either have to put up with a stretched picture or no subs!Streaming works flawlessly, and it linked up wirelessly to my Majority Soundbar without a hitch (though I did have to do a factory reset after 2 weeks because the audio from the blu ray on HDMI just stopped working! It was easy to fix once I figured out what was wrong).All in all, for under £250 it's a bargain!

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 TV was delivered today so this review may change. Video quality is fantastic with a great amount of settings to change it to your taste. Audio quality is very full, doesn't tear at high volume and has good base. Setup was quick and easy. The selection of apps is great and linking them was easy using phone. Arrived in perfect condition without a scratch on the box. My only complaints so far are : The screws are very hard to get into the legs. When trying to control the Tv very quickly it does lag but sorts itself out very quickly. I couldn't think of anything you will get more value for money, especially if purchased on Amazon day for a discounted price.Edit Feb 24 - TV still works great, no issue and no fall in product quality. I have had maybe 2 or 3 technical issues with the Tv, all involving Apple AirPlay connection (could be an apple problem)

Easy set up, crystal clear 4k, easy to navigate remote controlOnly negative is that if you are using the standard home screen (and not a device attached to an HDMI port) there is no way to adjust the screen resolution so using the built in apps such as iplayer or netflix the resolution is not 4k and appears almost blurry or out of focus, but once app is selected it'll then use the apps own pre-selected resolution (example being that the best video quality on netflix is controlled by your netflix sub)  complicated way of saying it, but fix the home screen to look clearer, please Amazon :)

Great TV
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 September 2023Size Name: 43 InchVerified Purchase
The quality of this tv is excellent, until now I’ve been using a HD tv and the upgrade to 4K is amazing. Everything else about the tv is good quality as well, it has 4 HDMI ports which is nice and one of them is arc so I can use my soundbar with it. It has an option for a stand and a wall mount which is good. A lot of reviews have been saying that the UI is a bit slow but I don’t think it is, I think it depends on the Wi-Fi speed, I have plugged my Ethernet cable into the back of it so it is getting a fast gigabit connection, with that speed internet the user interface is very smooth. It also supports HDR which I love but I have to turn it off for some things like playing GTA on my Xbox, it doesn’t look that good, actually makes it worse but I can just turn it off for that use, not a problem. The size and weight of the tv is good, not too heavy for a bracket. It also looks good with the bezels not being too big. The remote with the Alexa feature is excellent, being able to switch HDMI sources with your voice is incredible.

A 55 inch 4k TV for £379? (at the time of purchase) Hmmm ok I thought to myself, it ain't going to be great at that price but it will get me over Xmas and new year.How wrong was I? Picture quality is brilliant. Colours vibrant, clear, sharp & on point. Brightness is great, even in direct sunlight and sound, whilst not brilliant, is loud and clear (doesn't matter to me, I use an AV setup)All in all, this TV beats the 3 year old 43in Samsung (which cost almost 3 times more) it has replaced, hands down!!If I had to find one fault, the menus aren't the fastest but as it's pretty much used as a monitor for Sky Q and for some light gaming, that doesn't matter to me.Imho, at this price point, it is unbeatable.

This one was both and it is far better than another recent slightly cheaper Android TV I had bought. I also prefer this to an LG TV I own.Great picture, sound and easy to set up. Responsive interface and no crashing apps which I experienced on the Android TV. The controller is a good subtle evolution of the older Fire stick I own.

Big and mostly beautiful.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2015Verified Purchase
I've recently become interested in nature photography, and I was perfectly happy with my Nikon P520. But then my husband ( rather unkindly ) bought a camera with a better zoom. Well, I couldn't have that! I'd dithered about buying the P900 for a while, mainly because it was hard to come by, but eventually Amazon got some in stock and I took the plunge.First impressions - it's HUGE. I'd read reviews, so I knew it was bigger than my P520, but I wasn't prepared for how much bigger. It's also heavy, and a bit unbalanced when the zoom is fully extended. I thought I might have made a mistake as I already have a bad shoulder and don't need any more injuries from lugging this monster about!I took it to the RSPB reserve at Minsmere, and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't too much of a burden and was remarkably easy to use. Colour reproduction seems to be better than the P520, and it also focuses much faster, though that may be because I've been using the full time autofocus, which I've never done before. The huge zoom is definitely a benefit when photographing birds, but image quality is a bit variable at full zoom, even though I have digital zoom turned off. It's also quite hard to control the wobble, which isn't an issue when you're sitting in a hide with a ledge to brace yourself on, but is more of an issue when you're taking pictures 'freehand'.On the whole, I'm really pleased with the camera. I expect that the bad shots I've taken are mostly my fault or that of the dismal weather we've had ever since I bought it. I'm by no means a professional and I have issues with my eyesight that make it hard for me to see whether what I'm photographing is perfectly in focus, so photography has always been a bit pot luck. But I like what I'm seeing so far, and I certainly have no regrets buying my new monster!(I've uploaded a photo of the P900 next to my P520 for size comparison.)

Nikon Coolpix P900 versus Coolpix P510
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 July 2015Verified Purchase
I bought this camera as an upgrade to my P510, which is a very good camera in all ways, the biggest improvement I anticipated was the 2000mm zoom, which sure enough is very impressive, although not surprisingly it was difficult to use without a tripod, what I did not anticipate was the size of this camera, it does not look too big in its pictures, I read in a review that said it was a bit on the bulky side, and yes it is actually the size and weight of a SLR type camera.The P510 was purchased as my 'holiday' camera, where I wanted a better camera than a compact, but I did not want a bulky an expensive SLR hanging around my neck, the P510 fits this reqiurement perfectly, I tried the P900 on a recent holiday and found although it performed well and produced excellant results it is unfortunately too big and bulky to be my holiday camera, I may just as well have had an SLR with me, so I will go back to using the P510.On the plus side the P900 is slightly quicker to boot up than the P510, shutter slightly quicker to react, but if you have a P510 or similar this is not a significant upgrade apart from the 2000mm capability, I still have a use for the P900 but it will not replace the P510.In short the P900 is a very nice camera, for its price it is an absolute bargain, to achieve 2000mm with an SLR you would spend up to £10k, it is a shame it is so much bigger than earlier Nikon crossover type cameras.

Looking online for a possible camera to replace my current one, I came across one of the ""moon shot"" videos from the P900.  Initially thinking this was too good to be true, I did some more research and found several reviews of this camera.  Of course in the week sionce I bought the camera, it has rained almost every day, but I did manage to find a gap in the rain and the clouds and went out to take some moon shot pictures in the early morning.  Despite less than ideal conditions of a fairly bright sky and a faint mist, the camera performed admirably.  I've also managed to take a few shots of birds in the garden and again, I am very happy with the results.The P900 comes with a variety of scene modes, but can also be set to manual modes.  If you've used a digital camera in the past few years then you will have no trouble navigating the menus and finding the options that you want.  It won't give you the same level of quality as a professional DSLR, but nor will it require you to spend thousands of pounds on telescopic lenses.  For anyone sitting on the fence about buying this camera, I would recommend searching for ""Nikon P900 Instruction Manual"" on a search engine and then downloading it from the Nikon site.Overall, this is a great camera for this price range.  Definitely recommended.

But having had a disastrous LVL appointment back in Feb when my lashes didn't lift this time, and my beautician telling me they were looking so sparse she thought I'd been pulling them out, we googled lash serums, and UKLash seemed the best allover value for money.  The photo I have attached speaks for itself.  I started using the serum twice a day for the first month (mid Feb), without bothering to wear any mascara in the daytime, as my lashes were in such a bad state.  Started to notice a difference around 6 weeks later.  And they are sooo long now that I only put the serum on 3 evenings a week before bed.  My bottom lashes have grown to, due to some of the serum transferring when you blink.My only negative is that it has discoloured by eyelids a little bit.  Again, I googled this, and it is a side-effect for some.  My eyelids are a slightly darker colour above the lash line than they used to be. However as I have started using less of the serum, this discoloration has lessened.  According to articles I've read, this discoloration disappears once you stop using the serum all together.

Ideal for the traveller
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2019Verified Purchase
I take several packs of these with me when we are travelling, particularly when we go off the beaten track in places like India.  We have found them useful if we get an upset tummy to replace lost salts.  We find them particularly useful when we combine them with macrobitic capsules and if we have to use them, anti diarrhoea capsules and Cipro!  We have found that however careful you are with what you eat, hand washing etc, sometimes you catch bugs when travelling which you would not normally encounter at home.This product is nice an lightweight to carry and I tend to always have a couple of sachets with me as particularly in places like India, the onset of an upset tummy can be very rapid.  The combination of hot weather, repeated trips to the loo etc can make you feel extremely unwell very quickly.  On these occasions, I find that this product is invaluable at keeping me hydrated until the attack is over - even taking over a number of days.  The flavour is ok, although be prepared for the salty aftertaste: for children diluting it further can help and in severe circumstances, I have diluted it 4-5 times greater than what is recommended - ensuring that you keep your fluids up is arguably far more important than replacing the salts.A great product, light and compact to carry and when used in a regime of prevention, rehydration, treatment when required, they can make an uncomfortable experience somewhat more tolerable.

I have a condition which means I need to up my body salt intake. Many sports drinks have lots of chemicals I don't want, and other electrolyte drinks just are not as good. Dioralyte is perfect, easy to use and travel with, added to water on the go it is a sports drink you can take anywhere, without any of the additives.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 June 2023Colour: SilverSize Name: 64GBVerified Purchase
i wanted to spend as little as possible helping the daughter to find enough space to fill up the meagre space offered by these older iphones with inane but humorous videos. She had already chewed up the entire 32G on my old iphone 7, that I had generously donated, in next to no time with these snippets of audio-visual madness. This phone was the best value I found on amazon and i had spent at least 4-5 minutes researching this. That being said I was expecting a few scratches, maybe a dodgy camera or finger sensor. In reality this phone has passed every test so far (a very very minor scratch unperceivable unless you're using it 1cm from your face - the battery is 84% health - would have preferred higher, but >80% was advertised so ok with that. It has not only seamlessly received all the nonsense that was originally stored on the iphone 7 but has done this without any complaints using apple's old phone to new phone transfer. The daughter is happy, so I'm happy. It's only been one day but priced at 115 quid, it's worth it even just as an increase in storage on the 7. So much more than I was expecting - i thought it might have been a clerical error with the price as most others were at least £50 more expensive - and i do know this will go out of support in a couple of months, but it's still a great smartphone - especially for an emerging emo teen. Will provide an update after 1 month of use but what could possibly go wrong? as the friendsreunited employee said to the facebook employee.30 day update : not sure if it's a full month or not but so far phone is holding up well. lost her in the woods for over 20 hours last weekend but the battery held strong. next update in 30 days.Several month updatePhone is still going well. I did a quick search and no one is selling this same phone for as little as we paid for this one even this many weeks later despite it rapidly approaching technical oblivion. Maybe we are lucky but what can you say? It lives, it delivers, it hunts Pokémon. Next update in a few months.6 months. She’s dropped it and lollopped it many times sometimes on concrete, sometimes on imitation oak laminate. And they are only the times I’ve seen it happen. Still going strong and I wonder if perhaps this particular phone is simply leading a charmed life in the hands of the clumsiest child in the world. If it can last another 6 months I’ll mount it in a Perspex display case from ikea. I think they’re called bugelsploj.Nearly a year onFlabbergasted. This item is indestructible. I offered to upgrade it to a 12 or 13 mini but she’s having none of it. Some of the nonsense she’s created on it has had over 8.5k hits on YouTube already and apparently that’s a good thing. Onwards and upwards. This thing will become a family heirloom I’m sure. In 2100 a snotty descendant will likely appear on the antiques 8k roadshow and pretend to be interested in its history but in reality be expecting it to be worth more than a 1960s Rolex. Fiona Bruce or Fiona Bruce’s offspring will also be flabbergasted. Hoorah.

Tried to contact the seller to try and resolve the situation, but there was no answer from either land line or mobile. Although the Amazon site indicates that the units are throughly checked, it’s quite obvious that this is false.

I liked the packaging, the fact it comes with new wire + for plug is good. While the maximum capacity is not 100% which is what you would expect with it being a renewed device. The battery runs out extremely quickly, for reference about 30% per 40 mins. With minimal apps open. Would I say it’s worth the money, I really don’t know. Part of me is yes it is because it is a good quality device but then another side is like no ad the battery just lets the device down.

Better than the original 360 by far
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 April 2012Platform For Display: Xbox 360 250GBEdition: StandardVerified Purchase
I bought this as a replacement to my old Xbox 360. This new version runs quieter, looks better in my room, and is a more all-together package. Finally Microsoft have created a console that is an equal to the PS3: the hard-drive and wireless adaptor are now internal and come as standard.The hard-drive itself is more than enough for any games and add-ons you might want to download from Xbox Live. It's Xbox Live that is one of the main reasons to get a 360 - simply by owning the console you can use it as a silver member, but you need to pay a subscription to get the gold member access, which allows you to play games with other players online and use various other programs. Microsoft recently improved the service meaning that there are now a number of Apps you can download onto your console including Channel 5's and 4's On Demand TV service, BBC iPlayer, Zune film and music, Last.fm and more.Many of the various videogames you can buy nowadays have cross-console avalability, but there are some franchises that are Xbox exclusive: these include Gears Of War, Halo, & Forza Motorsport.The only issue I found was that the console did not come with a video-cable that allowed for High Definition gameplay, but you can pick HDMI cables up for fairly cheap now so it's not a major issue.Bottom-line: A quieter, smaller console with the various attachments now included internally. There's loads of great games and with a good internet connection you can take advantage of the excellent Apps. If you're afraid of your children accessing anything inappropriate for them there are various family settings you can set up, making this suitable for the whole family.

It is clearly a used console with a couple of scratch marks but that's all, it wall works as intended and I got 4 free games out of it so its not all bad!

Save money and buy a renewed iPad
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2023Verified Purchase
I have purchased this iPad as a Christmas gift for my mother as she always uses her tablet but her current one has been through the mill and it has a cracked screen and the charging port is damaged.When the I opened the box I couldn’t believe the condition of the iPad it was like brand new but it was far cheaper than if I had purchased a brand new one. Needless to say I’m over the moon with my purchase.The product comes with a nice wide screen with seamless edges finished in a sleek space grey metal case.The interface is user friendly with those familiar with Apple feeling right at home and those new to the franchise feeling comfortable with its ease of use. It’s a fantastic device and one I’ve purchased before but…Accidents do happen and I dropped my old one on the floor. This leads me to my only negative review. If you purchase this product I strongly advise that you buy a protective case as iPads are notorious for screen breaks and the aluminium body bending from either being dropped or rolled on during the night when you’re asleep. I bought an otter box for this one and it suits the device perfectly and will protect it from any accidental damage that may occur otherwise.Overall a fantastic product from Apple that performs well and looks very stylish. A 10/10 from me.

Great first DSLR
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 April 2017Colour Name: BlackStyle Name: Camera & 18-55mm Lens KitVerified Purchase
Bought this camera a year ago, it was my first DSLR (I had a film SLR many years ago, but only ever had a compact digital since), and it totally rekindled my love of photography. Very capable little camera with great image quality, ideal as a first DSLR. The JPEG engine is excellent: although I shot RAW+JPEG most of the time, I very, very rarely felt the need to use the RAWs, as the JPEGs straight out of camera were so good once I had the picture settings tuned to my liking. Battery life is very good - I never bothered to switch it off while out and about with it, as it uses so little power in standby mode. The rear screen is good. If you're a complete n00b there's a Guide mode to give you tips for shooting in different situations though personally I never used that.Downsides: It's definitely a stills camera, I never got good video performance out of it (the contrast-based focusing in live view is slow and unreliable, effectively useless in low light, whereas the phase-based focusing in normal stills mode is excellent and very fast). And I came to wish that it had exposure bracketing. Those things pushed me to upgrade. But I've passed the D3300 on to my 12yo son, and he's getting excellent pics from it (with minimal instruction from me) having never used a proper camera before.

My first move into full on digital photography after a couple of bridge cameras. I have given four stars so far as I am still working out how to do more than simply point and press. Some good photos so far but nothing better than  my Fuji bridge so far, although that is almost certainly due to my limitations as a photographer  in charge of most aspects of exposure. I hope to improve slowly but surely as I head into retirement but there is such a lot to remember, so dont expect to become an instant expert.The camera has an excellent range of auto and semi-auto settings and the Guide option is good for walking through some advanced skills. One minor issue is that the symbols on the buttons on the left hand side on the back all disappear in less than a month but Amazon replaced without a quibble and the new one is fine.I invested in a Tamron 70-300 lens which is needed to supplement the Nikkor 24-55 that comes in the kit. The camera is much heavier than my bridge withbthis attached, which is to be expected so a tripod or a steady surface is needed for lower shutter speeds.Overall an excellent camera with lots of potential for learning about digital photography. Patience is needed and I can highly recommend the 'D3300 for Dummies' book as a guide.

I bought this camera back in 2016 as an entry into the dslr level, my photography is mainly macro but I also do a fair bit of landscape as well, it's been used nearly every day since I bought it and i've taken hundreds of thousands of photos totalling over 1.5 terabytes on my hard drive and it's still running fine, the pop up flash went after six months but as I had 2 external flashes at home it wasn't an issue for me. the kit lens that comes with it actually produces some excellent shots and I have been really surprised at what it can do and how sharp it is so don't just stick it in a box and forget about it, macro photography quite often means cropping an image if it's a subject you can't get close to and i've no complaints about the camera there, at higher ISO ie 800 and above it doesn't do as well when you're cropping images but at ISO 800 you can get reasonable shot's providing you're not cropping a small area, if you're not using live view the battery lasts far better than most, I took over 1,000 shots at an airshow and my 64gb card was full before the battery needed changing, on average i'd say i'm out with the camera 300 day's of the year and so far apart from the built in flash there are no issues, I don't need a tilt screen or wifi connectivity so it has suited me well, value for money it's probably the best choice I could have made and i'd definately recomend it

Ease of Use for a Beginner Provides High Quality Images.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2017Verified Purchase
I bought the D3300 after researching a few other entry level DSLRs as an upgrade from my Sony compact and I have not regretted it. I am still getting used to it but the standard of pictures that I am getting are massively improved on what I am used to.Camera is reasonably small and fits comfortably in the hand though is much bigger than a compact (also depends on what lens you attach). I have taken it on Safari and had some great images in all lights (including darkness after playing about with the settings), also on a beach holdiday and again. The camera comes with a small 'how to' guide in addition to having a user guide option you can view on the display screen but most dials and buttons tell you what they are for anyway. The supplied software to transfer photos to laptop etc is also easy enough to use.I would have preferred the black but availability meant I ended up buying the red. It really doesnt matter though and has not bothered me in the slightest as it doesnt affect capability. The shoulder strap is also useful. The camera and supplied lens appear to be of a high quality build!All in all, as a beginner Id recommend due to its ease of use and high quality images!

Great DPI and you have the option of viewing your composition via the screen or the viewfinder with the press of a button.Great video quality (with options of VGA or HD720p/1080p) but would recommend external lighting or a lens light (horse shoe fitment) during darker periods to try and eliminate pixelation/noise. In good daylight, it's superb.Great entry level camera or even as a 'grab' cam for those quick shots you don't want to faff about removing your main from a tripod.

Not Perfect but Getting There!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 April 2023Colour Name: Silver with Charcoal StrapStyle Name: WifiVerified Purchase
I have had a string of smart watches over the years and none has been perfect. In many respects, the Huawei GT3 is my favourite but it has one Achilles Heel – no near-field communication, so no Google Wallet features. So I thought I’d give Google’s flagship an outing. And I’m pretty impressed. Which isn’t to say it’s perfect. To itemise the good first, the screen is lovely. It’s clear, bright and, given that the watch diameter is only 41 mm, remarkably large in appearance. That’s because there’s no real bezel to speak of, since the face gradually merges into the base. The diameter certainly suits me, as I have quite narrow wrists but that’s about personal preference. Second, the crown behaves as it should. That is, you can turn it to scroll the screen regardless of what is displayed. (Not all apps play nice with it but that’s not Google’s fault.) Third, there is one other control, a button, flush with the case, slightly above the crown. This lists recently used apps and is quite useful, given that not all apps can be selected as tiles. Fourth, the watch runs the latest version of Wear OS, as you’d expect. But it does so in an unusual way. When you first pair the watch with your phone, a new app (called ‘Watch’) is automatically downloaded to the phone. If you had a previous Wear OS watch, it remains linked via the old Wear OS app. All this happens without any input from you, so it’s very straightforward. Watch does everything Wear OS did plus a few new tricks but not always in the same way. It’s easy to get used to, though. Fifth, the Fitbit health features (including ECG measurement) are all bundled into the watch. Sixth, the microphone and speaker are good quality. You can hear a phone call very clearly and the caller can’t hear any difference whether you're using the watch or your phone.So what are the downsides? Well, first there’s the  perennial problem of battery life. Of course it depends on what apps you have open all the time and how often you interrogate the watch but my experience is that it loses about 2% of charge per hour when set to ‘tilt to display’. That’s not too shabby but remember I’m used to a Huawei beast that will happily last ten days with ‘always on’ selected.  Second, and inexplicably, Google has included an oxygen saturation sensor (SpO2) and then not implemented it in software. I assume it will appear in an update but why it wasn’t included initially is beyond me. Third, the full Fitbit suite is only included for 6 months. After that, you have to pay for those components that are in the ‘Pro’ version; and it’s quite expensive in my view.All in all though, I’m pretty happy with the watch. It’s got more right than wrong, especially for a first outing.

So far ( three months ) the watch has been very good . I needs a charge each day but only takes 15 minutes to charge up . The app works well and has proven reliable . The advert does not mention the small strap(even though it is listed as being included by other suppliers) The small strap is included in the box so it will fit the smaller wrist . There is no need to buy an additional strap if it is intended for a small wrist .

Function as simple as the alarm not accurate - too many niggles
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 July 2023Colour Name: Silver with Chalk StrapStyle Name: WifiVerified Purchase
I would consider using the watch as an alarm as one of the most basic and simple functions of any ""smart watch"". When set as a repeat alarm for weekday mornings, the watch would decide to change the days to Sunday to Thursday. Just once and I thought it was me - on the third time, this was the final straw. I googled it and it was shown as a known problem back in March, I bought the watch in June so I would really have through this should have been fixed.Other ""niggles"" - as stated by multiple other users - the battery really isn't great, made me worried about using it in case it ran out when I needed it.Got stuck in the updating cycle - managed to fix with a restart.When used to answer calls on the watch, the speaker was very crackly.Positives:  Looks good, tracker was accurate enough for walking, NFC worked well for contactless payments.Overall - I couldn't cope with the niggles and returned the watch.

Solid Watch When You Stop All The Apps From Monitoring Heart Data Etc
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2024Colour Name: Silver with Chalk StrapStyle Name: WifiVerified Purchase
Just to mention a few things, if you are buying this watch as an honest reviewer -1. The battery life is actually good if you stop the apps from working that take your body data for eg. heart tracking etc. I'm on 72% right now and it is 6pm, I put the watch on about 8am this morning so all the rubbish about the battery not lasting long is unfounded if you actually stop certain apps from tracking.2. You don't plug it into your phone to charge up, there is a plug that you can buy called a USB C plug and just connect via that way with the cable it came with.3. A tip if you are looking to buy is to keep checking on the different colour strap versions, as the price seems to fluctuate from colour to colour.4. The alarm I haven't actually used but in my mind why set an alarm on a watch when you can just do this on the phone itself?5. You can easily buy and replace the straps with ease, there are multiple straps out there very cheap so you don't have to break the bank if you are replacing the default strap which is quite large.All in all I'm happy with the performance, It's pretty snappy, NFC works well for payments, can't say I have a problem with the watch for what I use it for.

Runs hot at idle - It's fast.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 July 2019Size Name: Processor OnlyStyle Name: Ryzen 5 3600XVerified Purchase
Update  20th January 2020:I upgraded to a 3900x. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and l'm loving it. A few things to note for those of you Ryzen 3rd Gen. users and prospective buyers:1. Voltage offset is your friend. In my case and with my specific MOBO (Asus C6H - x370) the different Ryzen CPUs I had (3600x, 3700x and now 3900x) behaved in the same way:- High voltage at idle up to 1.5V- (Thus) 'high' idle temps: around 37-45ºC- Around 1.2-1.3V at load, temps around 60ºC (ranging from 55 to 65ºC on a Corsair H150i Pro, quiet pump and all fans spinning around 800 RPMs).I don't care what ""Robert"" from AMD says and I surely don't trust him; I trust the numbers I get on my PC. So, if you want a quieter, more efficient, longer lasting (probably) Ryzen 3rd. Gen. CPU, I advise to go the 'voltage offset' route. Personally, I have my chip set to -1.0V so the 3900x never has more than 1.4V fed to it (I did the same on the 3700x; l actually had this CPU with a 1.250V undervolt and it did just as good as stock. I haven't tried to go so 'low' on voltage on the 3900x yet. I bet it'll work just fine, but until I try it I won't know for certain). I have run benchmarks (games, Cinebench) and I get slightly better results with the offset voltage. YMMV.2. If you want a totally silent PC experience (and have the appropriate components you'll need for it), I suggest you set a fan curve where fans won't spin up until the CPU reaches 62-63ºC AND you set the fans to have around 3 to 5 seconds response delay (you can actually set normal fan curves as long as you have a 5 seconds response delay. Just observe the CPU behavior and you'll understand the *rational for this).*This is all about trying to get around the 'low usage' and 'high voltage' Ryzen 3rd. Gen. behavior. Open an app and it'll boost up to its max., having the voltage fed to it to its max., too. This causes the temps to go much higher than at idle but just for literally a couple/few seconds. I've noticed the CPU won't care whether my fans are spinning at 2000 or 700 RPMs: it will still reach such temps. and settle there.Thus, the way to go is what l mentioned above. That way, your fans won't bother what the CPU is doing and will only spin up when the CPU truly needs it (beyond 62-63ºC). Funny enough that will hardly ever happen (almost never in my system) as, unless you don't have the appropriate airflow, your 3rd Gen. Ryzen CPU will hardly go beyond the aforementioned temps. Sure enough, again, your temps will vary according to the airflow in your case and ambient temps.3. I don't think l have noticed a significant improvement when going from the 3600x to the 3700x and then to the 3900x (as expected). All these CPUs are pretty snappy and a joy to use (once it's all properly configured). Unless you have a workload that requires more than 6 cores OR you are an enthusiast like me who gets thrilled just by thinking you have a 12 cores and 24 threads CPU, you're probably better off with the 3600 (even the non x).If you aren't planning to change the CPU until 3 years or beyond (and you like gaming) l'd probably buy the 3700x. Games like Battlefield V do use those 8 cores and even 12! I've seen ""BV"" using 54% of the 3900x (that's using those 12 cores fully and some of one thread) and I see up to 64% usage when 'loading' the game ""COD MW 2019"" or the next level. That is insane.If you aren't a gamer, an enthusiast and/or you won't utilize applications that take advantage of extra cores, then, really, go and get a 3400G. It's an excellent CPU (on daily, 'normal' usage you wouldn't notice a big difference between that one and the 3900x. Of course there is a difference, but not the one you may have in mind; not a 4 VS 12 cores difference.I got a 3400G for my wife and she can't be happier. Mind you, l would've gotten her the best available in the market had l thought a difference was to be found (for her PC usage). The 3400G will save you money (cheaper, no GPU needed, less powerful PSU required... even the electricity bill will be cheaper... ;-)Girls and boys, if you have questions, down in the comments. I hope this helps!Update 1st October 2019:I switched to a 3700x. The only difference l notice between the 3600x and the 3700x is when looking at MSI Afterburner OSD overlay while playing Battlefield V. Now, CPU usage is a lot less than before. If you're just a gamer you should be more than fine with the 3600x, l surely was. It just that seeing that high CPU usage while playing BV was bugging me (YMMV, as ever).The 3700x at stock (PBO off) is hitting advertised clocks in most cores. More importantly, idle voltage and temps are now settled after upgrading to BIOS 7501 (on an Asus C6H x370). I'm using Ryzen Balanced Windows Power Plan.So yeah, so far so good. Boy this's been a journey!I guess l'll now wait for an offer on the 3900x, not because l need it (not by any means!) but because l can and l am a PC enthusiast. Having 6 cores is good, 8 is great and 12 is awesome. 16 cores, l hear you say? Yeah, bring them on baby!Update 18th September 2019:- Upgraded to 5 STARS. At this price (I paid GBP 220, bought from Amazon), this CPU is amazing.- Added picture showing 2 cores reaching 4468MHz (HWinfo).- Waiting for BIOS update of 30th September.I continue being very happy with this CPU. It's snappy and fast. I have observed games like ""Battlefield V"" using it up to 90%. The game runs as smooth as you would want it (paired to a MSI RTX 2080 Gaming X Trio) and it's a joy to play.Now, my plan is to upgrade to a better Ryzen CPU next year and hopefully keep it for a few years (I'd buy an 8 cores minimum). If you buy a CPU having in mind to keep it for 3+ years, and you like playing games that utilize 8 or more cores if available (like ""BV"" does) then I would suggest you going for a 3700x instead. It'll be a better buy in that case scenario.Update (a week after purchase):I got into terms with this CPU and decided to keep it.After a week of daily usage l can tell this processor is faster and snappier than the one it’s replacing, a 1700x@3.9Ghz.The only problem I found is the idle temperatures are ‘somehow’ hotter than the 1700x (even when OC). Basically, when idling, the 3600x temperature jumps from around 35°C all the way to 60-63°C. It is a strange, ‘restless’ behavior (see my system’s specs at the bottom).I have come into terms with this by readjusting the fans’ curve. In any case, the fans every now and then rev up to speeds they never reached before (past 2000Rpms in the case of the CPU fans when the latter occasionally reaches 73°C for a few seconds while loading a game). This happens rarely, but I’ve seeing it.In most cases, while gaming or stress testing, the CPU tends to sit at 60-63°C with an ambient temperature of around 20°C.

            Update  20th January 2020:I upgraded to a 3900x. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and l'm loving it. A few things to note for those of you Ryzen 3rd Gen. users and prospective buyers:1. Voltage offset is your friend. In my case and with my specific MOBO (Asus C6H - x370) the different Ryzen CPUs I had (3600x, 3700x and now 3900x) behaved in the same way:- High voltage at idle up to 1.5V- (Thus) 'high' idle temps: around 37-45ºC- Around 1.2-1.3V at load, temps around 60ºC (ranging from 55 to 65ºC on a Corsair H150i Pro, quiet pump and all fans spinning around 800 RPMs).I don't care what ""Robert"" from AMD says and I surely don't trust him; I trust the numbers I get on my PC. So, if you want a quieter, more efficient, longer lasting (probably) Ryzen 3rd. Gen. CPU, I advise to go the 'voltage offset' route. Personally, I have my chip set to -1.0V so the 3900x never has more than 1.4V fed to it (I did the same on the 3700x; l actually had this CPU with a 1.250V undervolt and it did just as good as stock. I haven't tried to go so 'low' on voltage on the 3900x yet. I bet it'll work just fine, but until I try it I won't know for certain). I have run benchmarks (games, Cinebench) and I get slightly better results with the offset voltage. YMMV.2. If you want a totally silent PC experience (and have the appropriate components you'll need for it), I suggest you set a fan curve where fans won't spin up until the CPU reaches 62-63ºC AND you set the fans to have around 3 to 5 seconds response delay (you can actually set normal fan curves as long as you have a 5 seconds response delay. Just observe the CPU behavior and you'll understand the *rational for this).*This is all about trying to get around the 'low usage' and 'high voltage' Ryzen 3rd. Gen. behavior. Open an app and it'll boost up to its max., having the voltage fed to it to its max., too. This causes the temps to go much higher than at idle but just for literally a couple/few seconds. I've noticed the CPU won't care whether my fans are spinning at 2000 or 700 RPMs: it will still reach such temps. and settle there.Thus, the way to go is what l mentioned above. That way, your fans won't bother what the CPU is doing and will only spin up when the CPU truly needs it (beyond 62-63ºC). Funny enough that will hardly ever happen (almost never in my system) as, unless you don't have the appropriate airflow, your 3rd Gen. Ryzen CPU will hardly go beyond the aforementioned temps. Sure enough, again, your temps will vary according to the airflow in your case and ambient temps.3. I don't think l have noticed a significant improvement when going from the 3600x to the 3700x and then to the 3900x (as expected). All these CPUs are pretty snappy and a joy to use (once it's all properly configured). Unless you have a workload that requires more than 6 cores OR you are an enthusiast like me who gets thrilled just by thinking you have a 12 cores and 24 threads CPU, you're probably better off with the 3600 (even the non x).If you aren't planning to change the CPU until 3 years or beyond (and you like gaming) l'd probably buy the 3700x. Games like Battlefield V do use those 8 cores and even 12! I've seen ""BV"" using 54% of the 3900x (that's using those 12 cores fully and some of one thread) and I see up to 64% usage when 'loading' the game ""COD MW 2019"" or the next level. That is insane.If you aren't a gamer, an enthusiast and/or you won't utilize applications that take advantage of extra cores, then, really, go and get a 3400G. It's an excellent CPU (on daily, 'normal' usage you wouldn't notice a big difference between that one and the 3900x. Of course there is a difference, but not the one you may have in mind; not a 4 VS 12 cores difference.I got a 3400G for my wife and she can't be happier. Mind you, l would've gotten her the best available in the market had l thought a difference was to be found (for her PC usage). The 3400G will save you money (cheaper, no GPU needed, less powerful PSU required... even the electricity bill will be cheaper... ;-)Girls and boys, if you have questions, down in the comments. I hope this helps!Update 1st October 2019:I switched to a 3700x. The only difference l notice between the 3600x and the 3700x is when looking at MSI Afterburner OSD overlay while playing Battlefield V. Now, CPU usage is a lot less than before. If you're just a gamer you should be more than fine with the 3600x, l surely was. It just that seeing that high CPU usage while playing BV was bugging me (YMMV, as ever).The 3700x at stock (PBO off) is hitting advertised clocks in most cores. More importantly, idle voltage and temps are now settled after upgrading to BIOS 7501 (on an Asus C6H x370). I'm using Ryzen Balanced Windows Power Plan.So yeah, so far so good. Boy this's been a journey!I guess l'll now wait for an offer on the 3900x, not because l need it (not by any means!) but because l can and l am a PC enthusiast. Having 6 cores is good, 8 is great and 12 is awesome. 16 cores, l hear you say? Yeah, bring them on baby!Update 18th September 2019:- Upgraded to 5 STARS. At this price (I paid GBP 220, bought from Amazon), this CPU is amazing.- Added picture showing 2 cores reaching 4468MHz (HWinfo).- Waiting for BIOS update of 30th September.I continue being very happy with this CPU. It's snappy and fast. I have observed games like ""Battlefield V"" using it up to 90%. The game runs as smooth as you would want it (paired to a MSI RTX 2080 Gaming X Trio) and it's a joy to play.Now, my plan is to upgrade to a better Ryzen CPU next year and hopefully keep it for a few years (I'd buy an 8 cores minimum). If you buy a CPU having in mind to keep it for 3+ years, and you like playing games that utilize 8 or more cores if available (like ""BV"" does) then I would suggest you going for a 3700x instead. It'll be a better buy in that case scenario.Update (a week after purchase):I got into terms with this CPU and decided to keep it.After a week of daily usage l can tell this processor is faster and snappier than the one it’s replacing, a 1700x@3.9Ghz.The only problem I found is the idle temperatures are ‘somehow’ hotter than the 1700x (even when OC). Basically, when idling, the 3600x temperature jumps from around 35°C all the way to 60-63°C. It is a strange, ‘restless’ behavior (see my system’s specs at the bottom).I have come into terms with this by readjusting the fans’ curve. In any case, the fans every now and then rev up to speeds they never reached before (past 2000Rpms in the case of the CPU fans when the latter occasionally reaches 73°C for a few seconds while loading a game). This happens rarely, but I’ve seeing it.In most cases, while gaming or stress testing, the CPU tends to sit at 60-63°C with an ambient temperature of around 20°C. For example, playing Battlefield V (3840x1200@120Hz), as you can see in the (lousy) uploaded pictures.

Best Balance of Value and Performance
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 September 2020Size Name: Processor OnlyStyle Name: Ryzen 5 3600Verified Purchase
I have built a number of PC's over the years but not for the last three and since then the technology has marched on considerably.This time I was building a PC for my wife who uses Photoshop and needed a reasonably powerful PC to use the program fully. As such I got back into the weeds and started the upgrade to my personal memory module.And I found that Ryzen CPU's from AMD are currently the overall choice for performance vs cost if most of the online reviews, Youtube videos and magazines are anything to go by. Given that most of these views are held by people with far better technical knowledge than I, this seemed to be the way forward.So, which CPU?As ever with unlimited funds one would simply pick the fastest at the highest cost. However, back in the real world I figured two hundred quid or less was my target cost and this Ryzen chip fitted the bill perfectly. Without a doubt it hits the sweet spot and given it's overall popularity I suspect most people making middle of the range PC's feel the same as me.This comes boxed with the cooler and fan which, is not overly large. I appreciate that power users and PC hobbyists may well want something fancier with flashing LED's but what comes in the box works well, maintaining temperatures within spec and is also very quiet. Right now given that the PC I built is not for show I don't see any need to change the cooling arrangement at all.Paired with a decent motherboard this Ryzen CPU blows my old computer into the weeds. My wife is not a gamer but she does use Photoshop a lot as photography is her hobby and it can demand a bit from your PC when doing some tasks. Certainly her old computer struggled and often took quite a while to render some of the modified photographs.Not with this sucker. Now every task is quick and seamless with no waiting around. It makes using heavy duty programs a pleasure not a pain and thus has ticked the main requirement for my wife.Overall, I'm with the majority. AMD have nailed it with the Ryzen CPU's.

Bottle faulty - spray didn’t work
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2024Verified Purchase
I have changed my rating from 1 to an 5.. why? Well I have left the original review below but Absolutely fantastic customer serviceI had an issue with the spray mechanism and reached out to Sons not expecting much. I had a reply from Will who asked about the issue and said he would get it sorted outI was expecting them to send me a new bottle replacement but they sent out a repayment product with fast delivery which is just brilliant customer services. I wasn’t going to sign up long term to this company but with service like that they have made me reconsider using them regularlyOriginal review: The bottle was faulty, the spray didn’t work - I emailed the company Sons for advise and didn’t get a reply. Also after not being usable it did fall over on the worktop and leaked so the seal isn’t great either. Wouldn’t recommend- better products out there in the price range

Definitely works with continued use
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2024Verified Purchase
I started getting a lot of hair loss and visible bald patches. My hairline thinned a lot and the crown was the worst. This has absolutely helped as I can see lots of improvement in hair growth in my hair line and temple area. I have used one full bottle as instructed and am now on a second bottle.I also lost some eyebrows due to eczema flare up and these were just not growing. So used a spoolie and used the solution on my eyebrows and they grew back honestly within 2 weeks. You do have to keep using the solution to see results. Use it alongside a good hair oil, massage your scalp everyday for a few minutes and a good brush.I was hoping for less hair fall and while I’m not having clumps as much my hair did shed a lot usinf this but I heard this was normal and it’s not as bad now. Don’t be alarmed if this happens I believe just new follicles are forming. I can’t really see the hair on my crown but I can see some growth. I think that will take longer to grow up I am hopefull.

Sons 5% Minoxidil: Promising Results in the Early Stages
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2024Verified Purchase
I've been using Sons 5% Minoxidil for a short while now, and while it's still early days, I'm genuinely optimistic about the results. This product was recommended to me as a solution for hair thinning, and I decided to give it a try.From the onset, the application process has been straightforward and hassle-free, fitting easily into my daily routine. There's no strong odor or residue, which is a big plus. Although it's too soon for dramatic changes, I've noticed some promising improvements. There seems to be less hair fall, and my hair appears fuller and healthier than before.What's encouraging is the progressive nature of the results.Each week, there seems to be a subtle yet noticeable improvement in the thickness and overall health of my hair. It's reassuring to see these changes, as they suggest that the product is indeed working as intended.It's important to remember that results with Minoxidil can vary and patience is key. However, based on my experience so far with Sons 5% Minoxidil, I'm hopeful and excited to see the ongoing improvements. If you're considering a hair growth treatment, this product is definitely worth trying out.

I was someone that always had a thick head of hair, I’d noticed slight thinning but nothing major. So after a few months, silly me without actually doing my research bought into this product thinking this is gonna thicken my hair up again. No, actually the opposite, I now have bald patches exactly where I applied this. I’ve stopped using the product but no regrowth on the bald patches after a couple of months, unfortunately it looks like this a permanent issue now from my poor decision to try out this product. Not only has this shattered my confidence. There is no actual solution to reverse what this product has done.I would recommend doing your research and don’t make my mistake as this comes at an irreversible cost.

It (eventually) works
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2024Verified Purchase
Been using it for my beard. It works, but it works very, very slowly, requiring a lot of patience and money. The reason I'm rating 3 stars is they keep putting the price up, which is just making me look elsewhere for cheaper minoxidil. Put the price back to £20 and you'll have a customer, if not, I'll be looking for the widely available cheaper options.

Lovely watch, very motvating!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2019Colour Name: Petal Pink - Copper RoseStyle Name: Versa 2 Standard EditionVerified Purchase
I got this for my birthday and I have been using about a month now.  This is my first Fitbit so I can't really compare to the other models but as an individual product it is great.I bought it to encourage me to walk more and have been using it for my couch 2 5k runs, I find it seems fairly accurate and the automatic workout sensor is very cool although it did get it wrong one time and thought I was on the eliptical when I was actually running lol! but every other time it has been correct in sensing whether I am running or walking.The sleep function is very cool and seems to be accurate, I find it interesting to check each morning!The app is great although at times I can have trouble SYNCing it to my watch, it always resolves after I turn off bluetooth and reconnect but can get a bit annoying.  The app is great though, you can find more in depth information about your sleep cycles, your steps, distance you've walked, your workouts and more, you can track your period and symptoms and it will predict when you are next due on, you can also track your birth conrol pills etc.  I you wish you can track your calories and the food you've eaten or the water you have dank.  There is a community section and you can add your friends to motivate and support each other which is very nice.  There are many apps to choose from, there are apps for kegel exercises, for meditation/mindfulness, for toothbrushing etc.There is a premium function but I have not bought it, through this you have access to workouts etc but for me personally I wasn't willing to pay for it from the reviews I read it seemed overpriced.  Another thing I have read is aparently the tend to break if you use them in water so be careful of that..I personally take it off to shower etc as to me it's not worth the risk.  I like to use spotify through my watch when running/walking as it makes it so much easier to skip through songs rather than pulling my whole phone out!Overall I am very happy with the watch, it looks great, I got the pink colour and I love it! It looks smart and goes with every outfit and it doubles up as a nice accessory as well as being functional.  It definitely motivates me to keep active and I love all the additional apps and functions, I would recommend it!

Versa 2 vs Versa 3
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 November 2020Verified Purchase
When I was trying to decide what Fitbit to get I found myself torn between the versa 2 and the Versa 3, and I’m sure many others are to, so here’s my breakdown on why I got a Versa 2 and not a Versa 3, and what I think of the Versa 2 now I’ve had it a few days.The main difference with the Versa 3 is that it has built in GPS, google assist, a built in speaker and a faster charging option... all things I could easily live without when the Versa 2 was only priced £129.99 (during a Black Friday sale) while the Versa 3 was £199.99.The Versa 2 may not have GPS built in but if you have your phone on you (which I always do) it uses the GPS from that anyway so having it built in isn’t necessary.There may not be any google assistant but Alexa is built in, and as someone with an echo in every room already this is a much more practical voice assistant for me anyway.The Versa 2 still records all the same fitness stats (24/7 heart rate, daily steps, all your workouts, calories burned, water intake, food intake, menstrual cycles etc) and the mobile app is the same for both watches. I’ve found all the data it’s recorded to be accurate and both the app and the watch itself presents the data in an easy to follow way and it’s quite simple to access it all.It also tracks your sleep automatically and though you need to pay for Fitbit premium for some data (more detailed heart rate and how often you move in your sleep) all the main important information is recorded accurately and is easily viewed.One of my concerns before getting the watch was not liking the way the clock was set out. I’m not a fan of the hours being piled above the minuets. Thankfully there’s are loads of free (and even more that you can pay for) clock faces to choose from and personalise. You can add your own pictures from your camera roll, change colour schemes or pick a clock face that needs no adjustments but suits you fine (some of the ones I like are pictured here).The smart watch part of the Versa is also great. I get all my phone notifications pop up on my watch (but you do need to go on the Fitbit app and under settings on your watch allow other apps access to it so their notifications come through). When out running I can see if I’m getting any texts at a quick glance which is great.I can also control my music on my watch. I use amazon music as my main streaming device, which fitbit doesn’t support as such (not in the same way it does Spotify), but if I start it playing on my phone I can then skip though the songs plus play and pause them using the watch, which to be honest is all I need.I’m also extremely happy with the overall look of the watch. I love the colour of both the strap and the edge of the screen.The strap also has lots of size options (and even came with a second larger strap incase that’s needed).My one gripe with the whole thing is the charging dock, which firstly didn’t come with a plug, just a usb, but secondly it just feels clumsy. It doesn’t really stand up straight and from googling I’ve been able to see that it works best on its side, but still falls over and doesn’t really feel like it’s the best design. Saying that it does the job and charges the watch quickly (and the charge last AGES!!).Overall I’m extremely pleased with this watch and would recommend it above the Versa 3 if you’re looking to save a little money and you’re happy to have your phone on you all the time for the GPS.EDIT- My husband also got a Versa 2 this week and we have since found that controlling your music works better on my iPhone and is complicated and not worth the hassle on his Android phone. He also has the option to reply to text message on his watch while I can’t do that with my iPhone.

Buyers remorse
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2024Verified Purchase
I have buyers remorse after this purchase. At £25 for both bottles and without checking the negative experiences of others, I was hoping for a miracle in a bottle, but it turned out to be a pricey purchase with no benefit. I have given it one star for the packaging which is lovely. The scent isn't great. The shampoo smells mildly minty and the conditioner more herbal which isn't for me. After four weeks if using this product I've found it damaging on my hair. It's very drying to the point I've had to discontinue use. I can honestly say it's made no difference what so ever to my hair growth. I'm very disappointed and will not be recommending this to anyone experiencing hair loss.

Great looking addition to the collection
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 November 2022Verified Purchase
This was a 'main' birthday pressie for my Marvel obsessed husband so I expected something a bit posh for my money...and it certainly looks the part at first glance. On closer inspection it's a bit more plastic and 'kid's costume' quality in many ways  but I know I'm picky. The colour's flat with no detailing in shade at all and in my opinion it doesn't look 'the money' at all.  The other disappointment would be the sound and light aspect of the helmet, which are glitchy at best, and the instruction leaflet provides no hint as to how to get them to work properly - we had to find a review on Youtube.  All that being said, the way the mask part of the helmet is a cool design and sits on top with a really strong magnet attachment which looks really effective. Husband says it's a but claustrophobic-making to wear with the mask part affixed on the front so he wears it with the mask on to and it looks awesome - I figure I know what he'll be taking to the next comic con...!  Overall I think it's a relatively nice piece of kit BUT I don't think it's really worth the money considering it's a licensed collectible. There are cheaper options out there that look way better and have better designs. If this was mine I'd be tempted to add some depth to the paint job, but Husband loves it so I guess it was worth every penny.

Scary doll
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2023Item Package Quantity: 2Verified Purchase
Oh boy, where do I even start with Kewpie mayonnaise? I mean, this stuff is like a party in your mouth - and not necessarily a good one.First off, the bottle itself looks like it's straight out of a 1970s sci-fi movie. I half expected it to start beeping and flashing at me like some kind of intergalactic distress signal. And don't even get me started on that creepy little Kewpie doll on the label. Is it just me, or does that thing look like it's plotting to take over the world?As for the mayo itself, well, let's just say that it's definitely an acquired taste. It's thick, gloopy, and has a weird tangy flavor that's hard to describe. It's like someone mixed together a jar of regular mayo with a bottle of vinegar and a dash of soy sauce, then left it out in the sun for a few days.But hey, if you're into that kind of thing, go for it. Kewpie mayo is definitely not for the faint of heart. Personally, I like my mayo to be a little more... normal. You know, like the kind that doesn't make you feel like you're eating an alien condiment from another planet.Overall, I give Kewpie mayo a solid ""meh."" It's not terrible, but it's not exactly a culinary masterpiece either. Unless you're a die-hard fan of weird, tangy condiments, I'd say stick to the regular stuff. And for the love of all that is holy, keep that Kewpie doll away from me.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 June 2019Item Package Quantity: 2Verified Purchase
Bought on a whim, after a quick google to read repeated reviews on how amazing this is, I bought some.WOW.Lets get the big thing out the way - it's got MSG in it. It's a flavour enhancer, so it's helping enhance the flavour of the mayo, and whatever you are eating it with.AMAZING in sandwiches, AMAZING on chips (quite similar to good Dutch mayo I reckon) and frankly amazing on everything I can smother in it.Yes, its more expensive than a big bottle of boring pure white mayo, but you don't need to use as much to get more flavour out of it. I won't be going back to blandness after eating this.It's a lot easier to buy this than wait for my Dutch colleague to bring me Mayo back from her holidays!Comes in a slightly strange feeling thin squeezy bottle. Unscrew the red top, peel off the foil, pop the red top back on, and you are ready to go.Sometimes it's just worth spending those extra few pennies and turning a good meal into a TASTY meal.

I poured a fair bit and mixed with coke and I'm finding it actually quite nice 🤣 kind of botanical tasting... Liquorice and aniseedy, a bit flowery, but nice 😊🥃 definitely worth the purchase for the quirkiness!So I gave it 5 stars, ok, it's not a 5 star rum, but! So many bad reviews I don't think it's worthy of... I mean, come on! It's KFC rum, what are these people expecting! 😄 obviously a novelty item, not a connoisseurs favourite tot.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2024Colour Name: WingsItem Package Quantity: 1Verified Purchase
I kept seeing these on various social media reels and thought my daughter and myself would like them but though they might be a bit rubbish and poor quality. I was reluctant to pay for the more expensive ones but the cheap ones wouldn't arrive in time so I ordered 2.  I was so wrong, we both love them. They are really good quality, well made and change shapes smoothly. They are magnetic and hold their shape. The stickers are well stuck on. They don't rattle as if there is something loose inside them when shook. I did think they were a bit small, I'd expected bigger but they are the perfect size to comfortably rotate, any bigger might be uncomfortable to hold.(Don't be fooled by cheaper ones as I've just bought some to try and they are very different to these.

            I kept seeing these on various social media reels and thought my daughter and myself would like them but though they might be a bit rubbish and poor quality. I was reluctant to pay for the more expensive ones but the cheap ones wouldn't arrive in time so I ordered 2.  I was so wrong, we both love them. They are really good quality, well made and change shapes smoothly. They are magnetic and hold their shape. The stickers are well stuck on. They don't rattle as if there is something loose inside them when shook. I did think they were a bit small, I'd expected bigger but they are the perfect size to comfortably rotate, any bigger might be uncomfortable to hold.(Don't be fooled by cheaper ones as I've just bought some to try and they are very different to these. Loose magnets inside so don't hold shape, stickers are only thing holding them together and they came off after a day of playing with them, very clunky and noisy when moving so I asked for a full refund. )These have been played with none stop since Christmas day and passed around different family and friends, children have had a go and still look as good as new.

This toy is absolutely brilliant. I'm 50 plus years of age so I've seen every toy that you can create shapes with, but this is next level!  The person that designed this is a genius. The shapes you can create and the satisfaction it brings is truly heartwarming. Almost like having a statue you can change daily and to think all the shapes evolved from a cube! Sturdy, well made and as far as I'm concerned it's one of the best ""devices"" I've ever played with.

I wish it was the remake we were hoping for, but still, I can't count the hours I spent on the Xbox 360 playing this all those years ago and it does at least have full HD 1080p graphics, which hold up surprisingly well on my PS4. Great value too. Wonderful game, if you've not played it, please do give it a go, the story is utterly fantastic as is the open world created by RockStar back in 2013.

Great. However…
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2023Verified Purchase
This is a great game. It laid the foundation for one of the greatest games of all time, RD2.However, the mission that requires breaking in three horses towards the end of the game is such a disappointment on two levels. It’s unreasonably difficult, relative to its importance. It also kills the pace of the plot. Having won an epic battle in the mountains John returns home to round up cows, kill a few animals and break horses. It’s kind of boring and anti-climatic, when and where we encounter it. A better option would have been to place these missions at the start, so we can learn these basics. It would only require a minor plot change. It would also have ensured the game’s plot continued at pace right up to the end.

Having played the original back in the day before the RDR2 hype I wanted to play again too see if it was as good as I remembered and it is! The remake is beautiful and plays great at 60fps. Don't expect next gen graphics as it's still based on an old version but the voice acting is exceptional. If you've only played the sequel then give this a try. You won't be disappointed!

Don’t even need a host as the answers are on the back so all can join in. Was great Christmas Day fun with 10 of us playing between 8 and 80 years old !

I managed to use both cameras up within 3 days of shooting.The photos came out alright. The only thing I would say is always use the flash, the photos can come out pretty dark with some indoor shots that I thought wouldn't dark. Other than that shots in the daytime with lots of sunlight was the best quality.Overall, if you want a cheap way to take film photos or just to create photos with a nostalgic feel then these cameras are great.

This is my first Google phone after being a Samsung user for years, and more recently Huawei, and I've found I do enjoy it for the most part.Good bits: The finger print scanner is much better than previous phones I've had, and it's rare that I have to try more than once to unlock this way - even with a screen protector on. The screen is crisp and I enjoy that there's a seperate app menu from the home screen, as you don't have to find a place for every single app you download on your home screen. The double tap on the back to screenshot (or other function you choose) is a really cool addition that I find useful. The back camera quality is great and as someone who films a lot of time lapses, I really like the ability to alter the speed that the time lapse records at. The digital wellbeing options are also really helpful for someone like me who can waste hours on social media without realising.Bad bits: I find the front camera to not be so great in low lighting, and it often comes out grainy. I've also found that when recording video, the microphone records at a very low volume, which isn't ideal. There are some random things like the inability to mirror an image in the editing options on photos which are also quite frustrating. The lack of warnings before your phone loses battery is also something that's taking me while to get used to - after my huawei telling me 30 seconds before shut down, the Pixel only gives a 10% warning and shuts down immediatly at 1% with no time to quickly grab a charger. The lack of face recognition is also something to get used to, but as mentioned the fingerprint scanner works so well that it's really not an issue.Generally I am really enjoying this phone! Is it the best phone out there? No. But does it still do a good job? Absolutely!

I am not really very impressed I upgraded to Google 6 Pro as my Huawei P20 is over 4 years old  and -  thought the battery was dying I also thought that the camera on the Google 6pro would maybe be equal if not better than my Huawei  --- The camera on my old phone takes better quality pictures and the battery which is  4 years old is  lasts longer than  he new Google P60 pro - the display is fine - memory is passable - don't expect to save many videos as they really gobble up your memory and the Cloud -- on the whole the phone works it just is not impressive -- maybe when they can teleport us I'll get a decent phone lol

Have an autistic almost 4 year old. This has been great for him to start learning with. The range of apps are fantastic and it’s got good battery life as it tends to last all day then I charge it in the evening. I don’t personally experience any issues, sometimes it is a little slow to load but also finding that’s helping to teach him patience so silver linings and all! My older daughter likes the tablet too she’s 6 so it covers quite a lot of the younger ages! My son broke his first tablet after the first week, Amazon handled it so quick I got the new tablet before I sent the old one back so he wasn’t without a tablet which is amazing and fuss free, highly recommend getting the tempered glass screen protectors tho as this seems to be pro-longing the screen from breaking this time!

Lifesaver for Buffer-Free Streaming!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2023Verified Purchase
I can't believe how much of a game-changer the Amazon Ethernet Adaptor has been for my Fire TV! I was constantly plagued by buffering issues while streaming due to my unreliable Wi-Fi connection. But ever since I plugged in this little wonder, my streaming experience has been nothing short of flawless. I'm finally able to enjoy my favorite shows and movies without any annoying interruptions.Setting up the adaptor was a breeze – just a simple plug-and-play process that even a tech novice like me could handle. The build quality feels solid, and the cable length is generous enough to reach from my router to my TV setup without any hassle. What really impresses me is how stable and consistent my connection has been since making the switch. I'm now able to stream content in high definition without worrying about sudden drops in quality. If you're like me and were struggling with Wi-Fi-related buffering problems, do yourself a favor and invest in this Ethernet adaptor. It's a small investment that makes a world of difference!In a world where streaming has become an integral part of our entertainment, a reliable connection is everything. Thanks to the Amazon Ethernet Adaptor, my streaming frustrations are a thing of the past. It's like having a direct line to my favorite content, and I couldn't be happier with the results. If you're looking to enhance your Fire TV experience and bid farewell to buffering, this adaptor is the answer you've been searching for. Highly recommended!

Works very well ... until it broke after a month
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 September 2023Verified Purchase
I have bad WiFi signal around the house (thick walls, lots of steel joists) so this ethernet adaptor for my Firestick was a godsend.  I use it combined with a Western Digital Livewire Powerline home intranet system.  It was very easy to install and the reaction speed, loading time and picture quality on my Firestick was transformed.  This seemed like the best £16 I'd spent in a long time.That was in early August.  A month later the Firestick said it could not find any signal and the Network setting showed it was not connected to the internet.  I swapped back to using WiFi and it worked (slowly).  I changed the CAT-5E cable, I checked to see if other units running of the WD Livewire system were working (they were) ... so I had to conclude that the ethernet adaptor had broken after only a month.  I ordered a second ethernet adaptor and it has just arrived.  I plugged it in, switched off the WiFi signal, and the wired network started working straight away.  So it was a duff adaptor.  This is a great bit of kit, and really good value for someone in my position, but it needs to be able to last longer than a month.  I just have every finger crossed that my first adaptor was a one-off bad unit, and this second one will last a year or two, at least.

I wish I'd bought a camera like this years ago
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2012Style Name: 18-55 mm Lens KitVerified Purchase
This is a lovely bit of kit. I have a 75-300 lens for it as well as the standard lens.We took the camera on a 6 week holiday and I started off simply using it in the default automatic mode - the results were really impressive with fantastic detail, clear crisp colours, fast focus and so on. The PC application to download photos was very fast and easy to use. The other PC applications work well, but I haven't used them heavily.As time went by I experimented with some of the other automatic modes such as portrait, landscape, sports and so on. Each did its job perfectly and the results were simply stunning.The manual for the camera comes on CDRom and after two weeks I started reading it. I discovered the first ""advanced"" mode which allows you to chose which of the 9 focus points gets used, allows you to use different scene modes, vary the aperture and shutter speed (as you turn the dial it moves between different combinations that are in balance with each other), adjust the 'film' speed, and various other controls. This is a kinda semi-automatic mode, but with more creative control. Again the results were stunning. There are proper advanced modes but I haven't got to them yet.I know there are cameras with more mega-pixels, but this already takes photos that will print on A3. The resolution is so good that I have been able to take poorly composed photos and trim them so that they are better composed, and despite the resultant image obviously being smaller as I've trimmed quite a chunk off, they still print perfectly - if you think about it you could cut a lot off an A3 print and still get a 4x6 or bigger.I haven't found a single thing about the camera that I don't like. It is so easy to use on automatic that my technophobe wife can pick it up and take a great photo. Its advanced features, and I haven't gone very advanced yet, have allowed me to take some really fantastic photos (I'm really pleased with a low-light shot where flash was forbidden - I simply changed the film speed until I could get a fast enough shutter and the picture was glorious).I struggled for ages before buying this as I kept wondering if spending a couple of hundred pounds more on the bigger brothers would be worth it. I'm now glad I bought this and a decent zoom lens as I've got far more out of it than I would have done buying a bigger brother and not being able to afford the zoom lens.

With Canon you can. It's true!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 July 2012Style Name: 18-55 mm Lens KitVerified Purchase
Well, what a fabulous camera.I'm fairly new to DSLR, owning my own anyway. Having generally been a very casual point and shoot photographer in the past, I've always been a fan of superzooms - very easy to use, monstrous zooms and superbly cheap.However, I wanted to take things a little bit more seriously, better results, more lens/filter creative options etc.Having tried my friends 1000D previously, I presumed it would be similar, and it is, nice chunky weighted build, easy to get familiar with etc.Negatives - the hand grip is completely smooth, make sure you keep tight hold! A bizarre design; the older design had a bumpy gripping surface but for whatever reason that is lacking here, if your hands are damp at all be careful! Keep the strap around your neck that's for sure...Loud! Maybe that's something I need to get used to in an SLR or with Canon anyway, but a very loud shutter, you're likely to scare any wildlife off at close range.It's the old version of the lens kit that comes with this, decent lens but seems weird when the included instruction manual is describing the newer version of the lens.Positives - Very easy to use, quick shutter speed, continuous shooting, bright LCD (I had heard negatives about low resolution, but it seems very bright and clear for me). Lot's of fun, enough creative options to get you started, auto flash, good viewfinder, decent life in the battery pack.Be aware first timers, you will certainly need a better lens if you're wanting to shoot any kind of distance, so budget for that almost immediately...All in all, I'd buy it again. Ace starting SLR with lots of lens options to keep it my camera of choice for years rather than months. Great price on here as well!Buy it!

Great camera
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2014Style Name: 18-55 mm Lens KitVerified Purchase
Amazon as usual very slow to despatch but that aside its' a great little camera, good spec and easy to operate once you've read the manual a few times. Disappointed it didn't come with the Image Stabilised lens although you shouldn't need that at these short focal lengths. I also bought a 55-250 IS lens where you sometimes need stabilisation at the longer focal length.I think the 12 Mp quality is un-necessary unless you are blowing up pictures for street size posters, the lowest setting is good enough for PC viewing and 3 Mp good for A4 prints.It's light and well balanced with through the lens viewing - very practical camera which comes with some good software for editing and printing. You can also operate the camera from your PC, not only shooting but changing settings. Canon also have some good support features on its website where you register it.I not only use it for terrestrial photography, I use it with my 8"" telescope and spotting scope with the appropriate adapters - it gives excellent results with both and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it in spite of the fact that the price went up by £5 since I ordered mine - it's still good value and probably beats all other prices.The only complaint I have about the kit is that you'd expect to be able to photograph something straight away - you can't - you then have to buy an SD card to store the images.

this Digital SLR Camera is really good, nice grip, the lens that comes with it is okay the zoom isn't that good but quality of pics are amazing. its got a nice steady shot. the weight of camera is good not heavy.i like the fact that the LCD screen can come out so when your shooting from top or bottom you can still see the screen. i wish you could edit pics on the camera its much faster if you just want to make some touches. it doesn't come with a memory card so your going to have to buy it separate. this camera is overall a good camera i would recommend it to anyone who is wanting to do portrait photography, macro and still life, because the camera gives really good quality pics.

Hit of cherries with dark rum finish
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2024Style Name: Kraken Black Cherry & Madagascan VanillaSize Name: 70 clVerified Purchase
Generally more of a whisky (and Irish whiskey) man, but I thought I'd try something different.I was so-so on the ordinary Kraken, but I figured the cherry flavour would work with the slightly bitter molasses finish of the rum.And I was right.I was hoping the vanilla wouldn't be overpowering and it isn't.In fact, if it's there it's very subtle to the point I don't notice it.And trust me, if I got a big hit of vanilla essence the bottle would be going down the drain!I'm not convinced the cherry flavour is natural, it doesn't taste artificial, just that it's quite strong and sweet which has triggered my suspicions nature.The spirit itself is a little on the coarse side, and definitely needs a good bit of ice to help it down without a bit of a grimace.At 40% it's not too hot, just not a smoothie like the surprisingly gentle Southern Comfort 100% Proof.Yes, I said smooth and gentle to describe a 50% by volume spirit - try it and see.Anyways, Kraken cherry and vanilla, be it natural flavouring or artificial is something I'd be buying again and I'll be investing the coffee variant to boot.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 March 2024Verified Purchase
As an avid PlayStation enthusiast, the challenge of having only one TV often meant making compromises—until I discovered the portal. This ingenious device has revolutionized my gaming setup, allowing me to immerse myself in gameplay while keeping the TV available for others.The ergonomic design of the portal is a triumph, nestling into my hands with the same ease and comfort as the PS5 controllers. The display is nothing short of spectacular, boasting brilliant clarity and picture quality that brings games to life. Despite rigorous testing, I’ve experienced no lag or connectivity issues, though my ultra-fast internet connection might deserve some credit here.The battery life is exceptional, powering through a staggering six hours of intense gaming. I’ve found that disabling the lights extends this even further, a small tweak for prolonged adventures. While the portal’s audio is impressive, I prefer to connect my PS5 headset for an uninterrupted sonic experience.I’m holding out hope for future enhancements from Sony, particularly the ability to stream directly to the portal. This feature would elevate an already remarkable device to new heights. Nonetheless, the portal stands out as a flawless piece of technology in its current form.A special mention must go to the delivery driver, whose diligence in ensuring the integrity of the package despite visible damage was commendable. It’s heartening to see such dedication to customer satisfaction.

Does one job well. More to come?
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2023Verified Purchase
At the time of its release, this device has a single purpose: to allow you to use your PlayStation when the rest of your family wants to use the TV for other purposes. It is very good at that: it is light, the screen is bright and colourful and the controls are familiar. The Portal is a bit large and unwieldy, but you can easily find a comfortable position to use it for long periods. The only difference in the controls is the touchpad which is emulated with the touch screen. You will need a good WiFi signal to both the PlayStation and the Portal for it to work well, but that’s probably not too difficult as the living room is usually the best served by home routers. While it is possible to do so, don’t expect a fully remote connection to work well (or easily). Cleverly, when you activate the PlayStation through the Portal, its HDMI port doesn’t switch on and disturb the TV. There is a barely perceptible lag and the very occasional glitch which means it’s not the best way to play multiplayer FPS or anything requiring microsecond reflexes but it’s really good for farming or grinding while watching the TV and everybody else in the room are probably on their phone anyway. There’s a mini jack socket for the earphones of your choice. It’s sad that they are not provided as they are pretty much compulsory in the context the Portal is used, but on the other hand, you probably have a whole collection of them from your old phones anyway. No Bluetooth that we know of.Of course, the Portal has only been out for a week and there is no saying what else Sony could do with it. It is so much like a Wii U that it would be surprising if it couldn’t be used like that in the future. It also has its own computer, so there is still a possibility it could be used as an independent console. Or Sony could surprise us with something wild once there are enough Portals around.

There's tips on line to improve the performance by unplugging your hdmi cable from the console or turning the video out put on the ps5 to 1080p. This still did not help. Why a 200 pound device isn't capable of doing the basics Is absurd.  Put it this way with out Internet this is a 200 pound lump of useless plastic.  It's a shame because the rare moments it did work I enjoyed it and  I can see the appeal.

An end game headphone for £90?
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 March 2024Style Name: Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm HeadphoneVerified Purchase
I have seen this headphone on many many you tube videos in studio and recording artists and was wondering why this headphone has become an industry standard for many recording studios and musicians over the past 30 years and now I have this in my collection I can honestly see and understand why this headphone is such an industry standard, but what is often overlooked and not mentioned is how wonderful this headphone is for leisure and listening pleasure.The headphones are well constructed and clearly built to last, a soft padded headband with easy adjustments with a solid click for each increment. The earcups are a combination of quality plasitcs and metal for the piece with the Sony Logo the the classy 'Professional' wording.  The cable is a coiled cable which is well made and quite thick which insills a degree of confidence in the cables quality.The earpads are a soft pleather material which is thin and will have to be replaced after 3 or so years as this is well known to disintergrate over time. They are of the type that is a between on the ear and over the ear depending if you are a dumbo or a normally gifted ear size. They are very soft and very comfortable though and I have no issues with the comfort they afford me and can wear these for hours on end with NO discomfort.Now onto the most important bit of my reveiw the SOUND. I have owned many headphones from Stax, Beyerdynamic, Sennheisser, AKG, HiFiman, Audio Technica mostly higher end models in the ranges and let me tell you these Sony MDR 7506 are incredible! I can't quite get my head around how a £90 headphone can put many much more expensive models to shame, Sony engineers obviously did some kind of deal with the devil to extract this kinda quality out of this 40mm Dynamic driver all those years ago.Yes Iam going to give you the old cliche of saying Iam hearing things in my tracks that I have honestly never heard before and everything sounds so natural and not forced in any way. The treble is verging on the bright side but never seems to go into the realm of being harsh it just sits there in perfect balance with the rest of the sound spectrum. Bass is tight and well controlled and can go DEEP into the sub bass when the recording has it. You can hear individual notes that are well seperated from the rest of the mix.Mids are lovely and natural with womens vocals (that can pull apart even the most very expensive headphones) are rendered with a wonderful realism that is truly mesmerising Diana Krall never sounded SO good.Soundstage being a closed back is not in the Sennheiser HD800 league obviously but it is portrayed very realistically with good imaging and separation and does not sound congested in anyway.These headphones faithfully portray the mix as it is which is exactly what they are designed for.These are a keeper and will remain in my collection and will be used most frequently than many others, now I understand why these headphones are such an industry standard and put many many other headphones to shame. designed over 30 years ago and never beaten for what it does.A true game changer for me and a headphone I now fully understand.

The Sony MDR-7506/MDR-V6/MDR-CD900ST is what many people in the audio space call a ""tried-and-true"" design. A simple metal headband with a vinyl finish and plastic driver housing. Though plastic, it is a very reliable material that can handle heavy usage and light weather. The three similar, yet different designs can be identified by the text on the driver. The CD900ST and V6 has a sticker that screams ""FOR DIGITAL"", while the 7506 has a sticker that says ""PROFESSIONAL"". I'd take off the sticker, looks even more professional.Beside sound, a headphone is worth buying if it is comfortable to wear for long listening sessions. The MDR-7506 is exactly that... if you have a smaller head. Though the headphone is light and the headband is able to cater for large heads, the pads do not. They are intentionally shallow to improve treble response and localisation (the ability to locate where certain sounds come from). If you are someone who has a large head, change the pads the second you get these. They will press against your outer ear, which gets pretty uncomfortable after an hour or two. I recommend a good quality leather pad such as the SOULWIT's or the YAXI stPad 2. These pads has more cushioning and better sealing, which helps with noise isolation and bass response. Actually, even if you have small heads, get new pads. The pleather material is likely to wear off quickly, especially in humid environments. Another thing you can do for comfort is to slightly bend the headband. As the headband is metal, it can be bent to suit larger heads better. Other than these small issues, the MDR-7506 is fairly light and comfortable for long usage.When it comes to sound, the best way to describe it would be ""neutral-warm"" that shows ""honest"" qualities. These do show flaws in recordings, the quality of the file you are listening to, and more subdued details that not many headphones within this price point cannot. The only headphone that can do this are the Koss PortaPro or the Koss KSC75 (technically an ear-speaker, but whatever). The bass is slightly warm, which more listeners tend to prefer. This helps with bass (the instrument), kick drums, timpanis, and footsteps. The mids are clear and revealing. Each and every part of the band is present without presenting honk or sounding hollow, and the treble is neutral, if slightly extended.This headphone is definitely recommended if you want a ""honest"" sounding headphone that will last you decades.

Fantastic video editing headphones!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 August 2023Style Name: Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm HeadphoneVerified Purchase
I'm using these for video editing in Premiere Pro and they're super comfortable (even though I wear glasses). You can wear them on and off for hours and they remain comfortable. The 3.5mm jack plugs straight into a MacBook Pro with no issues. Editing sound and confirming levels is made easy.The reason I gave the headphones 4 stars was because the retail packaging/box the headphones arrive in is quite bad and tears easily (outer box head wear and tear already). Additionally, the carry bag/pouch Sony includes in the box doesn't actually fit the headphones, so it's pointless? That said, the headphones themselves are worth the price.

There is a computerised voice to tutor one in the installation.  However, when I tried to enter text (e.g. the Wi-Fi password) the keyboard popped up but I could not enter any text.  After much frustration I realised that to enter text I has to press a key three times (one long and two short).  Near the end of the setup one screen seemed to freeze as I could not get it to move.  Again after must frustration I realised that to move the screen needed a two finger action (in a manner of speaking).  My other gripe is the ringtones or rather lack of them.  Within Settings the ringtone can be changed.  However, the only ringtone available was the one already installed.  Do these phones leave the factory with a random ringtone or are they all the same?Having got these points out of the way, this is an excellent phone.  The battery lasts me about two days.  Charging from empty takes about one and a half hours.  This is the default setting of fast charge and according to Google does not reduce the battery’s life.  All actions on the phone are fast e.g. searching the internet and opening videos.  The storage capacity of 64GB appears to be adequate Bear in mind that about a quarter of this is occupied by the operating system.  However, I would suggest that use of an SD card is essential.  I live in a poor phone reception area and my last phone was near unusable to make calls.  This one gives excellent reception.Before buying this phone I researched professional sites for reviews.  The considered opinion was that the phone was adequate.  I beg to differ.  I have never used an expensive phone but fail to see what one could do better than the A40.  I believe that the price is astonishingly good.  Why pay more?Yes, as people have said the phone was originally for the European market.  However, this is stated on the box and the only “foreign” bit was the basic set up instructions which were in Slovak (I think).  Do not let this put you off.

I payed less for this phone than I would from anywhere else. Mine started off in Portuguese, but was easily changed to English, also the Quick Start Guide was in English.The phone works well - the battery life is as good as my old A3. The only thing that I would criticise is the step counter; it seems to be faulty. It is on 132 when my smartwatch is on 2000. Doesn't matter to me since I have the smartwatch.Otherwise it seems like a good choice of phone for someone who is budget conscious. I bought the phone outright and have a SIM only contract (with Plusnet). I reckon to save about £100 over the 2 years that I would otherwise be paying for the phone on contract.

An Italian import with italian literature. No problem setting the phone up with English language. Phone updated to Android 9 and Samsung One UI upon set up. Had to delete or deactivate various bits of customisation put in by Samsung for the Italian market as well as some of the samsung bloatware we have no need for.Runs fast and smooth, lightweight, not too big, loads of memory, great screen visible nearly up to the edge, surprisingly good sound from the speaker too.Very happy with it.

AC origins is an incredible game, loved it from second I started playing all the way to the end. The collectors edition has a quality statue of bayek on the goddess head, it's a really nice design and top quality built statue, you also get a soundtrack with the game, cobra skin dlc and first piramid and there is a nice map aswell, the outer box is a really cool design and the game is just incredible. It's the first of the assassins creed Rpg series and it was one of the best in the series, you follow bayek who is the creator of the assassins brotherhood known as the hidden ones originally, he's wife aya is also a founding member and they build the order together from a tragedy that causes them to become assassins hunting down their prey.The game is vast open world of Egypt and is in first century when ptolemy was the pharaoh of Egypt, you meet alot of interesting characters once again who are historically accurate with fiction aswell,The likes of cleopatra and the mythological gods of Egypt.It was a mix of combat and stealth but the combat has been refind from previous AC titles and is much more fluid and challenging now without the kill combos, there is light attacks and heavy attacks with blocking and dodging movements and also for the first time you have a shield aswell which is very handy, you can still parry an attack with a well placed press of the button but don't expect to just kill enemies strait away unless using hidden blade and bow and arrow combat, it's much more versatile then the original AC games and the map is a big area of land in Egypt, also you can use horses and chariots to traverse the terrain to get from A to be with view points being present like in earlier games. It is by far one of the best and most groundbreaking AC games ever released. It changed the AC games and the way they played.

Great game, with far better fight controls, great graphics and lush scenery
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 October 2017Platform For Display: PlayStation 4Edition: Gods Collector's EditionVerified Purchase
Ignoring the 'troll"" post of 1 - who seems to have given every version of this game 1 star and the same bad feedback on all the versions of the game (Xbox and PS4) plus a host of other games. I will continue with my genuine review.I got my edition about 3pm (Royal Mail on release day) and did not get a chance to play it until 10pm that evening due to other chores, nice to see it arrived on the day!The game graphics are highly detailed, and plays differently to the previous Assassins Creed, no ""treasure chests"" as such, but pressing and holding the ""^"" key on the controller will activate the scan to reveal hidden objects, these can be chests, statues, various shaped boxes or receptacles and you then use the 'triangle' key when next to them to loot to get coins or rewards.  The options key brings up the main inventory, quest, skill tree, gear tree etc, and you can use R1/L1 to scroll across the options. Graphics and camera to me caused no problems and it soon felt natural, the fighting sequences are far better and using R1/L1/R2./L2 to swing, block etc.  The characters also are very well detailed and in a lot of cases appear so well done it is in effect a movie.Another nice touch is the Eagle used, which allows you to switch to the eagle flying constantly, control it up/down and steer its flight path to seek adversaries, or things to loot, it allows you to mark objects so your main character can then ride or run to that location to interact with.  Most of the main controls for this are the four main cross keys <> and ^V. Which includes whistling to cause enemies to investigate and calling your mount.Once your eagle has locked onto the thing you are looking for you can use ""circle"" to return back to your main character to then head over to that location to continue your quest. I have only played the game for 2 hours tonight, but will update my review as I get further into the game.All in all, this is great game, and well worth the money, for the Gods Edition, you get a nice book with art, CD Rom of the music, map of the game area, 2 extra missions/add on's with the codes printed on, the main game and the lovely statue (each version from Gods upwards has a different statue) The Gold Edition has the season pass and deluxe pack, the Deluxe Editionhas no season pass but comes with the map, and CD)Is the entire package worth the £90 price tag?, in my opinion yes, however do remember there is NO season pass with this particular set, so do take this extra cost into account if choosing this version, but even without the Season Pass, it is still very good value for money- I have already bought my copy of that now so have that base covered.The statue is well worth the cost as it is beautifully modelled and detailed, the map (which is folded) I agree would be nice on an old style parchment paper and would make it more authentic however it does do the job and show you the complete game area.The audio CD Rom is in a cardboard sleeve which makes it more environmentally friendly and whilst a plastic case would be nicer, it does not affect the overall quality. Finally the book of art, is compact and well put together and worth having to compliment the set.  In my instance I work in computers and answer random surveys from a computer research firm, each survey completed can earn me £3 to £5 worth of Amazon gift vouchers (These are emailed to me by the unique ""Amazon Gift Card Code"" a week later and one I had was for £9), by the time I placed the order for this, I had collected nearly £70 in vouchers, and when it was finally shipped I had another £30 in the voucher fund, so ended up not paying anything from my credit card/debit card and still having £10 left.Each version of this game comes with different items so check carefully what you get as part of the package.Remember YOU DO NOT get the Season Pass with the Gods Collector Edition - so you will need to pay approximately £32 for the digital code, the Season Pass is only with the ""Gold Edition"" at £69.99, ""Dawn of the Creed"" at £119.99 and ""Dawn of the Creed Legendary - Do not faint here as this one is £699.99 the reason for the price is the statue is numbered and also in resin - rather than plastic"" [wonder how many of these they will sell] - both the last two editions are not available on Amazon, so Gods Collector is the top one they sell.

Is the God's Edition worth the Money?
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2017Platform For Display: PlayStation 4Edition: Gods Collector's EditionVerified Purchase
The release of the Gods Collector edition was an amazing purchase. Me and my friend went halves so he could have the game and I could keep the collectors pieces. The product came in a very nice, colorful and attractive box that keeps all the items inside safe and secure. Upon opening the box the model is packaged with a plastic molded protective layer to protect the model from being damaged or broken. The model is fairly heavy but due to the size of the model, just over 30cm, that was to be expected. The model is well made with very vibrant colours, amazing attention to detail comparing the figure to the in game character. The model also has a very nice backdrop that has a very nice desert/Egypt theme. This also has a small draw that holders the game, wrapped in plastic packaging, the folded map, collectors artist book and the soundtrack, all securely found in the bottom draw. The art book has some amazing images from the game and really pays brilliant attention to detail to different key parts during the game. The map shows a very clear image of the desert that the game is based in and you really get a proper idea of how big the world that the in game character has to explore and conquer. The sound track sound contains all 12 soundtrack included in the game and is a great extra for the hardcore assassins creed collectors and players. Overall the game is a very well put together game with excellent extras, a brilliant story line and loads of places and features for the players to have fun with and explore. A brilliant buy for such a cheap price for a collectors piece of kit!

I have 2 indoor cats so picking the right litter is important for me. I have tried pretty much every litter out there. Only one is miles ahead as the best, and it's this one. The 20L bag can be a bit heavy. So not ideal for those without any strength. I prefer to buy this size so it lasts me.I change the litter roughly every 3 days so the big 20L bag lasts me about 3 weeks.Personally I like to line my tray with puppy pads. I find they soak up excess urine. One of my cats pee's a lot! The litter is brilliant at absorbing mind you and the best part, it keeps down smells really well.I have never found another litter that even comes close.It can be more expensive than others but I found I'm buying less because I don't need to change it every other day. With other litters, yes they cost less, but I was buying more of them. So it was a false economy really.

SPIKYCAT5.0 out of 5 stars
A triumph of pure gaming over the mindless pursuit of more powerful hardware. The most important console yet of the 21st century
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2016Verified Purchase
I’m a little late reviewing this item, having bought it just over 9 years ago, but having played it again recently, I’m compelled to put some words down about the Wii, as a decade on It’s still a fantastic piece of kit. I’m also conscious that there are still people buying the console for the first time who might appreciate the view of a seasoned user.I’ve been a gamer since my childhood (I’m now 42), and have owned many different bits of gaming hardware over the years, starting with a Sinclair ZX Spectrum back in the early eighties, through many generations of Sega, Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft consoles since then. Without exception, the progression has always been represented by incremental increases in processing power of each new generation of hardware, with the competition always trying frantically to out-perform each other. Usually the primary indicator of this was graphical capability, with players being blown away by the new levels of realism afforded by bigger, better video chips.But when Nintendo launched the Wii, it was already behind the latest generation machines from Sony (PS3) and Microsoft (Xbox360) and it was widely known that the Wii simply couldn’t compete in terms of raw power with either of those. In fact, it was dismissed by many as a failure before it was launched, purely on the strength of its inferior hardware. The focus on ‘fun’ through the crossover with physical activity through the motion controllers was written-off as a novelty fad that would soon pass, with many proclaiming the console would only really appeal to the younger generation, and certainly not “real gamers”.How wrong they were. Nintendo were certainly taking a gamble, but it paid off big time. Not only was the Wii fun, but it engaged a wider demographic than either Microsoft or Sony had ever hoped to court with their consoles. Young children, teenagers, right through middle-aged and elderly players. The versatility offered by the Wiimote controllers to interact with games in a much more subtle and organic way opened the door for a whole host of wonderfully creative games, and even tried and tested genres had a new angle.The free Wii Sports disc bundled with the Wii gives a great introduction to the potential of the hardware and the motion controllers, with bowling and tennis being a definite favourite for many a rainy family afternoon (or wine-fuelled adults evening!). Then there are games like Cooking Mama. Who would have thought chopping onions would even be a thing on a video-game, let alone it actually being a physically taxing task, and much more fun than in actual real life? Putting an entire recipe together and seeing how well it turns out is an absolute blast, and when in competition with another real player, things get even more fun. Then there’s Trauma Centre, which takes the concept to an altogether more serious (albeit still hilariously fun) level. You take on the role of an upcoming surgeon, carrying out actual surgical procedures on patients, using the Wiimote and Nunchuk controllers to cut the patient open before manipulating various tools to carry out increasingly more complex and sweat-inducing procedures – getting ranked on your performance each time. Titles like these just could not be replicated on the PS3 or Xbox360, for all their technical power.There are literally hundreds of titles for the Wii that are worth playing. Sure, there are some that are duds, and the Wii versions of the majority of multi-platform games are not a patch on the PS3 or Xbox360 versions of the same game. But the point of owning a Wii is for all the games that do not, and cannot exist on PS3 or Xbox360. Thinking of the Wii as an alternative is all wrong – it’s a completely different proposition. If you already own a PS3/Xbox360, or PS4/Xbox One for that matter, you should have a Wii as well! It’s true that the Wii-U has since been released, and is a fantastic evolution in itself, but the Wii is still a very relevant console in 2016 as it is still such undeniable fun, has such a huge back catalogue of games and peripherals, and is available at a fraction of the price.Ultimately the Wii was a landmark moment in gaming. One that should be applauded, as a victory for gaming itself, over the mindless pursuit for bigger, faster, stronger hardware. The Wii did, and still does fire the imagination, and is a reminder why Nintendo is so very important to the gaming industry.

Innovative but Flawed
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2008Verified Purchase
It doesn't really have that 'addictive' quality that some consoles or games have.  I think the graphics are a step backwards but the idea behind the controllers is truly genius, although I do question the sensitivity.  I am sure that this is something that can be improved upon.The cuddly world of Nintendo lacks longevity for me.  I have a DS and similarly the touchy feely world of stroking and cuddling animals wears off pretty quickly.  I look at a game like Assassin's Creed (I know, I know, a different market) and I see a game that you could well play for hours.  Its a shame because there is no reason why Wii games have to be cuddly, could you imagine a title like grand theft auto on the Wii, if it was done properly? (might be a step too far though, in terms of 'interaction' and violence!)With strong advertising and a unique interface, I think the Wii is selling well.  I just hope that some of the titles that flow through to this console don't just ride on this inovation but actually try and innovate themselves.Update 30/11/09I do still play my Wii and the sensitivity I referred to above is probably improved with the new motion sensor (although some would argue that should have been there to start with).  Nintendo are now bundling Wii with the Sports resort title, which I have, so I feel that maybe I was a little harsh with my original 3 stars for the Wii.  Having said that, I do still want a PS3 now for the much improved Assasins Creed II....Just watch the games for the Wii, some are truly innovative, some are mediocare ports, whilst some are truly woeful.  Do your research!

No Brainer Upgrade.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2021Size Name: 1mVerified Purchase
My Sky Q box recently received the HDR update and the difference was quite remarkable. When it comes to HDMI leads I've never spent crazy money on the for the simple reason, as the experts point out, it's either HDMI or not. However the standards have improved over the years just as USB has evolved into USB3 and network cables from Cat5 to Cat8 for faster data transmission. My existing leads were Amazon Basics HDMI 2.0 leads and they worked fine, connecting my main TV, a 55"" Sony 4K@60Hz UHD with 10 bit HDR to my Sky box and PS4. However when I got the Sky HDR update I decided to buy some new leads and went for these Primewire - Premium HDMI 2.1 cables. At below the cost of some HDMI 2.0 versions on offer I thought you can't have too much bandwith, which is what it's all about so, I bought some. They arrived quickly. They are very well made with a braided outer sheath making them not quite as flexible as non braided versions. They fit the HDMI port nicely without having to force them in. On the picture front, I wasn't expecting a huge difference over the previous cables but, and I know the experts will probably sneer, the difference in picture quality is simply remarkable. Whether I'm watching something in HD, 4K UHD or 4K UHD HDR the picture just has more pop. Scenes are sharper, colours more vibrant and blacks are blacker. I've been watching ""This Strange Rock"" with Will Smith and been simply stunned by the quality of the picture. I didn't tell my wife what I'd done and the first time we watched the TV together she asked me what had changed as the picture was much better. I'm so impressed I've now fitted these cables onto my other 4K TV which is connected to a Sky mini-box and my desktop PC. Again, a noticeable improvement can be seen, especially in HDR games such as CoD WWII. So, either the previous HDMI 2.0 cables were not what they were suposed to be or the extra bandwidth of these 2.1 versions is transmitting more data. Not very technical or scientific I know, I'm just reporting what I see. But, if you're looking for HDMI cables, why buy the older 2.0 version when you can get these for less than a tenner. It's a no brainer if you ask me.

I needed to update my HDMI link between my AVR and TV. This cable easily copes with my UHD 4k 60Hz 4:4:4 (including enhanced HDMI) video content devices. All audio formats also work without any clutches. Admittedly,  I have not tried it with 8k as I don't have an 8k tv yet. I've recently updated all my HDMI cables with Primwire and they all work perfectly; and it didn't cost me the Earth to do it. These cables are very well priced; do not be put off with how cheap they are. Here, you get alot of bang for your buck. This is a prime example that you don't need to break the bank to get quality.

Assembly was very straight forward and instructions were very easy to understand.

As soon as I saw the trailer, I pre-ordered it on 'Game' and eagerly waited. On the day of the release, the delivery person thought it was a brilliant idea to shove the game through the Letter box! Long story short, the game box was broken and after a very long fight with Game, I got my refund.As soon as this happened, I turned to the trusty Amazon and ordered the game at good discount and delivery was amazing!Regarding the game: In my teens, if you told me Kratos would turn out to be an amazing father and even teach people a thing or two, I would have laughed at your face, but here we are in 2023 and I could not be more proud of Kratos. If you are coming from the first God of War game (2018) and expecting a wildly different gameplay experience then you will be disappointed, but the gameplay is much smoother and very fluid. So much so that even after moving on to the other games, I came back to this and earned the Platinum Trophy at last!All in all, the game is truly gorgeous and the story is super satisfying (Never expected to get emotional in a God Of War game). I usually sell my games once I finish them to use the extra cash for new and upcoming games but this one for the history books.

Very good game BUT it’s time for a change
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2023Edition: PS5Verified Purchase
I really enjoyed God of War Ragnarok and the combat is excellent, in the harder difficulties it forces you to use everything at your disposal and effectively too. Characters are written very well, the fact you see Kratos develop his more understanding, merciful and compassionate side is beautiful to see when in the past he’s been mainly a vessel for pure rage and destruction. The bond with Atreus feels very genuinely crafted, alot of scenes hit hard playing as a father yourself.I give the game 5/5 because of how much I enjoyed it I feel like I cannot give less, it is a very good game and most of the set pieces are masterfully executed, but if I was being very critical I would. Why, because too much of the games mechanics just feel outdated and boring. I am playing as the God of War, can someone please explain why I’m forced to crawl painstakingly slow through crevice after crevice and climb countless cliffs. At least in games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted they try to make these segments somewhat engaging and it makes more sense to be doing them in the context of you’re a human explorer but I’m KRATOS and the movement just feels so sluggish. I completely understand what they were going for with this and the original God of War 2018, but I think they focused too much on making the experience feel weighty and somewhat realistic rather than remembering first and foremost this a video game and the focus should be pure fun. The puzzles are also lame, why even include them at all when whichever NPC you’re playing alongside blurts out the answer if you don’t instantly complete it. The constant annoying chatter from your companions made me want to quit and boot up Elden Ring, I feel like my intelligence was being constantly insulted.These gripes are not exclusive to this game, I think it’s just the way most Western first party developers have veered too heavily towards and I feel like people need to start following devs like Insomniac Games more, all of their games are insanely fun to play and perfectly encapsulate what the focus of video games should be, pure enjoyment first and foremost. I know not all games can be the same but even when you look at a lot of  Japanese games (Metal Gear Solid, Yakuza) that are very custscene and set piece heavy, it balances out because the gameplay is so fun and fast paced. I really hope these outdated game mechanics stay in the last generation because from what we have seen already with pure next gen games, the potential for innovative creative and exciting games is endless, we don’t want to spend time having our hands held and wasting time climbing, that’s just not fun and devs need to start doing better.Ultimately Ragnarok is a very good game but ironically serves as a reminder that new generation games need to take bold steps in a new direction.

A SUPERB GAMEWITH EXCITING VISUALS
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2022Edition: PS5Verified Purchase
I've been looking forward to this game for a while. It took a little bit of time to install the 91GB base along with any patches. You start out selecting from a fair selection of accessibly options and other performance settings. Once in the game it gives you the option to catch up on what happened in the previous game which is nice to go through. You then kick off the game learning the basic movement and combat before really progressing into the fantastic game play. I have not observed any bugs or glitches in the game play so far. I did make sure to install the day one patch as recommended. First thing i really noticed is the haptic feedback on this game is amazing as are the visuals and sound effects. The combat controls are similar to the previous game and felt natural and easy to get into. Kratos himself is as gruff as ever with Christopher Judge continuing to do a great job voicing Kratos as the character develops new layers. Characters from the previous game return with the same great banter to lighten up a sometimes-heavy story. New characters have an interesting choice of voice direction but works well once you have got used to it. There are more side quests in this one and a lot of opportunities to explore to find loot for upgrading your equipment or making new equipment. The usual skill tree can be augmented if you use a skill enough times, you can unlock a rune for it to make it more powerful. Items comes with different perks so you can really customize kratos to your play style. So far, I'm very much enjoying playing Ragnarok and would absolutely recommend it to everyone.

These are very nice I really liked them although the cheese ones have a very distant flavour it’s quite hard to taste the cheese but it is definelty cheesy. The Carbo ones are amazing it is spicy I haven’t done any with all the spicy sauce since the stew ones were very spicy but it was alright. The sweetness and creaminess of the Carbo ones took it away but warning these are stilly very spicy. Don’t recommend adding all the spicy sauce. You get 5 in each pack. £15 is a little expensive but these are very good so I’m not sure if it’s worth the money but it is also as well because I saw some Carbo noodles for £12 and that was just one 5 packVery nice, don’t complain when it’s too hot for you though because you knew they were spicy so don’t rate them 1 star just because too spicy there amazing don’t listen to the negative reviews they are just angry because there to spicy but that’s there fault. So why not? Give it a shot!

I sit in the middle with this product, I feel it has the potential to be a life saver and elevate my look.  But, and this is a big BUT it is so fiddly to use and the product was wetter than I expected?  I think the knack to this is to lightly brush through your luscious brow hairs and build the product up and let it dry and shape.  Now for someone like myself who has the comparable patience of a cat in heat, I got bored and ended up looking like I'd been electrocuted.  Now for the aftercare, I found it difficult to remove the product and still felt a slight residue after it has been scrapped off.  It is worth the price, if you have the patience but this didn't do much for me personally.

Absolute gem of a product! My Son suffered really badly and this mousse was a God send!!I filled a sock full of rolled oats, tied it with a hair bobble and let him have a warm bath (no soap, just a milky looking bath) dried off gently then applied this mousse all over. Initially, he said it felt quite sticky but went in quite quickly and gave instant relief.I repeated this for 2-3 days applying only once and this was enough for him. The itching subsided and he is now fully recovered with very little scarring.Worth every penny and I even had enough left when my daughter came out with them three weeks later!

Bought for our 18 month old for chicken pox. He wasn't able to tell us if it felt better with this on or not. Bought this as it was reccomended by friends. We'd used plain old calamine lotion on our 5 year old a week or two earlier and that seemed to do the trick for him. Our youngest definitely got it worse though. This is easier to apply than calamine but not quite sure if the claims are backed up by any kind of science or clinical trials. The chicken pox cleared up after about a week. Jury still out of this helped at all, or if it had run it's course. Will probably never find out. Its expensive for what it is

After using suedocrem for a couple of days instead (which kind of helped) I found this and ordered straight away, it came lunchtime the next day and after her first application which was so fast and easy due to it being foam, she slept a full night without waking crying because she was so itchy. 2 days in using it and her spots have all scabbed over nicely and she’s full of beans!

And occasionally it sticks on the main menu screen and won't let you play a match till you restart it.Otherwise, a heat game, with the usual commentary, gameplay and player-making options as with previous years.All the footballers look a bit too 'toothy' if you ask me, but hey, whatever.

Outstanding engineering
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 August 2021Verified Purchase
The series S was more of a playful experiment to my eyes when it first got announced, rather than a serious offer that I would consider buying for myself. And yet here I am, writing down my very positive experience with it so far.Here are some key points, for those who don't want to read the whole review:Positives- The price. Ridiculous value for money, really. Even without the shortage on GPU's, I don't think £250 could buy you a card with better performance than the series S. Leave alone the crazy fast SSD.- The exterior design. This is a powerful machine, capable of some serious performance, somehow contained in a tiny rectangular box that fits everywhere. It can also stand horizontally or vertically without requiring a base, while looking extremely cute in both scenarios. Simple, easy, sensible.- Cooling. No matter what game you throw at it, there is no part of the console that feels hot to touch. The hot air comes out of that big black circle, without touching anything on its way out (like cables, ports etc).- All new Xbox features. Cloud gaming, Console streaming, Smart delivery automatic improvements on older games... Quick Resume is the feature that we all wanted but did not know.- Game Pass. The gaming subscription service adds so much value to the Xbox platform.Negatives- Questionable future. So far it has been keeping up with the series X, at least for 1080/1440p gaming with some acceptable reductions in image quality, but until when?- Unpolished UI on the main menu. I can almost always notice sound effects breaking and small lags when browsing the menus fast.- More or less 385GB are available for games, significantly smaller than the series X.- Previous generation titles that have not been optimized yet, run their Xbox one S version by default rather than the Xbox one X. This means you get the crappier version pretty much, even though the console could handle the best one as well.- No Blu Ray. I don't care about that one, but it is the only way to have access to the used games market.Just by going through the pros/cons list, one can easily see that great value for money does not mean the best possible choice always. I'm pretty sure that the extra £200 required for the series X (or a ps5) are totally worth it and it is the safest bet for many gamers.But there are many ways to choose the series S as well. Some people live in tiny apartments or rooms, some don't own a 4K monitor. Some prefer playing older titles, indies and will be extremely happy with the way the modern triple A's will run on the series S. Some just want a console to play with their kids and have fun without breaking the bank. Some just want to get a taste of game pass at the lowest price possible.No matter what the reason, the series S is an excellent machine that feels like and truly is a next gen console. You will get the full Microsoft gaming console experience and tons of entertainment and that is an astonishing achievement from the Xbox department.

The Perfect Living Room Companion
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2024Verified Purchase
I decided to complement my Series X in my office/gaming room with an Xbox Series S for the living room, after having a new baby. The Series S became an ideal solution for me to enjoy some gaming while staying close to my little one whenever he conked out on my chest, without the need to move and risk waking him up.My use of the Series S has been primarily for smaller ""indie"" games, as I tend to play the bigger AAA titles on the Series X. Despite not pushing it to its limits, the Series S has performed flawlessly for these games. And its compact size and minimalist look make it perfect for a living room setup and doesn't annoy the missus (too much).Additionally, last Christmas, I bought a Series S for my dad along with a Game Pass subscription. He's been playing non-stop and has nothing but praise for it even with the larger titles.In conclusion, the Xbox Series S might be the smaller sibling in the Xbox family, but it's a powerhouse for casual gaming. Its performance, coupled with its compact size, makes it an excellent choice for anyone looking to enjoy a wide range of games without the need for high-end gaming setup.

Wonderful little backwards compatibility machine
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2021Verified Purchase
This is a great console. It's obviously not as powerful as the Series X, but it doesn't need to be. The size is amazing, and can fit in any space, and plays every game available digitally on Xbox very well. I have a gaming PC so having this as a secondary device is a godsend. My partner also likes it as she can use it as a smart TV box for our dumb 1080p TV - it works with Plex, Prime Video, Netflix and so on.The SSD is fast, with the system booting to the dashboard before my Logitech Harmony even fires up my TV and soundbar and sets them to the right inputs. Apps and games load very quickly, and for games Quick Resume is amazing.At 1080p, the graphics look great. Some backwards compatible games aren't improved from the One S configuration (yet), but any game optimised for Series S|X loads quickly, looks amazing and has a higher framerate than the last-gen versions. If you have a PS4 or a One S, aren't interested in 4K and want a cheap upgrade to play Cyberpunk at an acceptable performance, you can't go wrong with this system.Chances are, if you know the Xbox Series S isn't for you, you won't be reading this review. But if you're on the fence between this and a more expensive console you may want to think if the following applies to you:If you have Game Pass and another system (like a PC or PS5) and want to play some legacy Xbox games and whatever MS is providing via Game Pass, this is an awesome system.If you've got a spare room with a TV and you want an affordable games console to go in there, Xbox Series S is the way forward.If all you want is an affordable way to play next-gen games for the foreseeable future, this is the console for you.It's also great for kids who want to play Roblox, Fortnite and Minecraft and not much else. It'll be a big improvement on the Xbox Series S - just be mindful that if they have disc-based games they won't be playable on the Series S.If you've got a 4K TV you probably want an Xbox Series X, PS5 or a good gaming PC, as games on this device will max out at 1080p-1440p. This console also doesn't have a disc drive so all your games and multimedia will need to be digital. Take that in mind.There's a lot of good and niche reasons to own this device over a more expensive system - if you fit into one of those niches, £250 is well worth the price.

That is a great console.I had a Xbox one and it was fine, but a bit slow and a few games were migrating to only cloud or only Xbox series, so I decided to get one and my only regret is not to have a 4k monitor. The design of it, how compact it is, how versatile, all in it is great, but the best graphics can only be shown if you have 4k monitor. Another down side would be the storage, but it is fixable, if you need, with a extension card or you could opt for the black version with 1Tb.5 stars for me and if you want the best out of it, make sure the storage is enough for you and you have a ideal monitor.

Best cosy game for mental health.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 February 2024Edition: Nintendo SwitchVerified Purchase
I got this game when I was 38. I bought it for my daughter. Then had to get it for myself. I love it. It’s so cosy. No more insomnia… terrified of the scorpion though ha 🤣 great community on social media. Great for mental health breaks. Honestly never saw myself as someone playing games like this but it’s very enjoyable. I highly recommend it. My own mental health has gone next level from playing just from the calm zen like state you get in as an adult. I play with my children too we all help each other out. For children it’s brilliant at layering tasks getting rewards and teaching patience and if not then there’s fishing and bug hunting and island hopping.If you’re stressed. Need a distraction. Have insomnia. Feel bereaved. Feel depressed. Post natal depression. Lonely. There’s the most supportive, inclusive community waiting that you can be involved as much or as little as you want… and you will never ever have a lonely birthday ever again! 🥲♥️

A great game very theraputic
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 July 2020Edition: Nintendo SwitchVerified Purchase
This is the best game ever, and thank god for it. I’m currently on furlough from work due to the Coronavirus, this game has been my life saver and when I have felt anxious or worried it has kept me sane.I have always loved Animal Crossing and played the previous games, but by far this is the best one I find it relaxing, very addictive and saved many an argument over the remote control for the TV.  Its fun for adults and I can imagine for older children it could be educational, such as having to work for money (or in this case Bells and Nook Miles), paying a mortgage off, also finding out about different Critters.  When you donate a new fish/bug or fossil Blathers the wise old Owl from the museum will tell you a little about the item you are donating. Also you can design things, decorate your own house and keep friends with your neighbours,  this is just a selection of the activities included.There is so much involved and so much to do once you have helped build the basics of the island like where you want to live, the Museum, Town Hall, Shops and assisted new residents to move to your island you pretty much free to do what you want.  You have the usual change of seasons, catching bugs, various fish (which change over the year) and finding fossils but a recent update now sees us deep sea diving for various sea creatures.  You still have the usual tournaments and annual events such as Halloween and Easter.What makes this Animal Crossing different is that when you arrive at your chosen island it is deserted and you are limited to where you can go on the island, you have no ladder to climb the cliffs and a vaulting pole to vault across the rivers, so choose wisely, the aesthetics of island does not really matter as you are able to terraform the land later.  As you have no equipment or furniture and no means to buy them as the game progresses you go from flimsy tools to more robust equipment, you also get recipes to build a whole range of furniture and accessoriesYou also have a choice between the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere, and you get the seasons to match.Also we see introduced are Nook Miles which can be earned by performing various tasks, Nook Miles can buy you certain items to decorate your island, terraforming equipment and best of all air miles so you can fly off to other deserted islands, if you are lucky to get a rare island it will bring in some big Bells (money).  You also have the opportunity to pick fruit that is not native to your island and stock up on the essentials to build furniture & equipment.The only downside of this game is that you cannot have multiple Animal Crossing discs on one console, it is one island per console, to have more than one island you would need a Switch console per game, which to me seems wrong.  You can have multiple players for the same island, but if everyone wants to play the game at the same time it could cause friction, lucky for me that is not an issue. Can I recommend it, if your looking for a lovely stress free game that has so much packed into it then go for it, it is worth every penny.

Coronavirus Salvation
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 March 2020Edition: Nintendo SwitchVerified Purchase
I pre-ordered this a while ago for my Nintendo Switch Lite.I have spent 2 days playing it so far and im not getting to bed until 4am, its so addictive. Good job we all are self isolating because of Coronavirus because i think i would lose my job.Its a nifty little game, there is so much to do, there is lots of going back and forth, gathering materials, making tools, accumulating miles and bells, fishing, and visiting mystery islands.I think ive played a good 20 hours so far over the 2 days, and ive only just managed to pay nook his 5000 miles and took a loan out for my house. There is a lot of work to do.This will take me months and months to get through, i am okay with that though because it keeps me busy, distracted from the isolation, and i really enjoy it.Fantastic value.Update:Im not sure if any you have played this before but wanted to share some tips and tricks that i had to figure out the hard way.You start off with a native fruit, mine was oranges. You have to pay 2000 miles for a nook ticket to visit mystery islands to try and forage iron nuggets and other fruits. Once you have those fruits do not sell them. Use your flimsy shovel to dig holes and then plant the fruit in the holes and it will grow a fuit tree. You have to look for Oranges, Cherries, Pears, Apples, Peaches, and Coconuts. On that last one, Coconut trees can only be planted on the beach.When foraging for iron nuggets, dig 2 holes behind you so that you dont fall backwards, and hit your stones with a shovel and it will spit out iron nuggets. You will need 30 to give to Nook to build the shop.Also fish twice a day, once in the daytime and once at night because you will get different types of fish.Upgrade with your miles to get bigger storage, it will cost you 8000 miles but its worth it.You will need a vaulting pole to jump over rivers. You will get it from Blathers when you give him 15 specimens to open the museum. Unlike other tools it wont ever break.Be prepared to replace your tools a lot because they do not last. When you get your house start stockpiling wood. Your house comes with a nifty feature. Free storage. You press right on the direction pad and you can put things into storage for safe keeping.  Shake your trees every day to get tree branches. Each tree will spit out 8 branches, but never more than that. Same with your fruit. Stockpile. You can use it to trade for other fruits when you visit other islands or when you get online friend codes. And you can use it to plant fruit trees. I have planted hundreds all over my island. Nook also gives you money for fruit so its a good money making scheme.When you get your shovel, once a day you will notice a glowing spot on the ground, use your shovel and dig a hole. It will give you a money bag. 1st one is 1000 bells. Leave the hole open and click x to select the bag but use the joystick to increase the value of the bag to 10,000 bells and then bury the bag in the hole. This gives you a money tree. Each tree then gives you 3 bags of 10,000 bells. You can then use your shovel to dig the money tree up and replant it somewhere easier to find. Ive put all mine next to my house, i have 4 so far.You will need them becuase infastructure later in the game is expensive. Your 1st bridge costs you over 100, 000 bells and more so you need a lot of money.Thats as far as ive got so far. Hope this has been helpful.

Lovely long lasting scent
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2024Verified Purchase
It was a pleasant surprise to find out that the bottle was bigger than I imagined it to be. The price is very reasonable for the amount of liquid. The scent is delicious! It lasts long both on skin and clothes (especially considering it's technically fragrance mist, not perfume). I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.I would definitely recommend this

I've had this phone for almost 2 months now and I have to say it was well worth the upgrade. My previous phone was the Galaxy A13, which I had for 18 months and I wanted more than just a replacement, but also an upgrade. This phone does not disappoint.Everything runs so much more smoothly and the extra storage has been great. This phone also charges so much quicker. My last one needed a good couple of hours to charge from 0 to 100% battery but this one can easily do it within an hour. Even though the camera is 50mp the same as my old phone, the image and video quality is still superior. The sound from the loudspeaker is great too.

Good phone, but  UAE model
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 March 2024Verified Purchase
Good phone. Reasonably snappy performance and good display. Cameras also good. Fingerprint unlocking is a little slow compared to my old Moto G 5G Plus., and the phone also annoyingly requires you to unlock using PIN/Swipe from time to time anyway (holding your finger on the sensor has no effect under these circumstances).If you're wondering why the price is so competitive, it's probably because this is a UAE model (i.e. not originally intended for the UK market). So far the only difference that I've noticed is that there is no eSIM functionality. If this is important to you, then I'd recommend you pay more for a UK model.

Excellent phone although on the heavier side
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2023Verified Purchase
I think this is a great phone that offers all of the features I need at a very good price.I use my phone for three main purposes: taking photos (of friends, family, and holidays), listening to music and podcasts, and watching a bit of media (mostly YouTube but also some Netflix). For all three of these purposes, I'm pleased with the performance of the phone.I'm sure there are phones that take sharper, more beautiful photos under low light conditions. But I'm just taking snaps to share with friends and family - and I'm happy with the quality of these photos.Listening to music, I use a third party app that I previously purchased on the Google Play store. The app is working fine and the music quality played through my Bluetooth headphones is excellent. I think the sound quality is more dictated by my headphone quality than the limitations of the phone.Watching YouTube and Netflix, I'm happy with the picture quality. I can't detect any pixellation or stuttering of the frames.The phone is also perfectly fine for the few calls I make. It's fine for phone calls as well as video calls.I'm not a picky phone person. I wanted an inexpensive phone that was able to take a memory card (so that I can physically back up the photos that I take). The phone is on the heavier side - but as I usually just have the phone shoved into a pocket, I really don't notice the extra 10 or 20g in weight. Overall, I'm very pleased with the phone and think it's excellent value for money.

Gets spider senses tingling! Great game.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2018Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
I bought this to get my kids off Fortnite and it has done the trick.This is a great game, but maybe not without its little flaws. Although Spider-Man for PS4 does get a lot right: swinging, combat, story, Spidey's personality, etc. there are a few things I found a bit annoying.  As an example, the Sinister Six team-up is teased but really only incorporated into maybe 5% of the game - the majority of the story focuses on Mr. Negative, a relatively new character to Spider-Man's rogues gallery. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it does feel like there was an opportunity  here that was perhaps wasted. The story itself is also fairly predictable, even though it's held together with some really great performances throughout.There are a lot of busy work tasks to complete like collecting backpacks, landmark tokens, research tokens, pigeons (yes, really) that, while not bad, never feels particularly interesting, either. I also found myself surprised at just how much aerial combat there was, particularly late in the game, when the combat system frankly doesn't support it very well. The last few fights are more annoying than challenging, particularly the final boss, who feels cheap and unwieldy.There are also occasional stealth segments where you play as someone other than Spider-Man and must sneak past armed enemies. These are usually pretty short and decently-constructed, but every time one popped up I wanted to rush through so I could get back to being Spider-Man already.Overall I definitely enjoyed my time with it, the photo mode is great, it looks and feels fantastic, I love the optional suits and just how satisfying it is to see them in motion, but it's definitely not without some flaws.Nevertheless I would recommend this game to others and particularly if you want to get your kids off Fortnite!*** Please could you click Yes if my review has helped you in any way ***

Amazing!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 November 2018Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
I've taken my time to write a review of Spider-Man. I completed the game a few weeks ago and have been mulling it over since.I had very high hopes for this game during its build up. Like many, I had great memories of the classic Spider-Man games on the older playstation consoles and really wanted this to live up to that. I was so relieved when it did and then some!Played on a PS4 Pro through a 4K HDR TV, the game is stunning to look at. The cityscape is breathtaking, particularly at sunset, and swinging your way through it's buildings, parks and skyscrapers is a joy to behold. Frame rate is solid, no noticeable dips on my playthrough, even with a lot going on on-screen.Gameplay-wise, it does follow most other modern-day 3rd person action games. If you've played Assassin's Creed, any of the Arkham games, Shadow of Mordor or Horizon Zero Dawn - you'll slip straight into it. It combines the elements we've come to expect but does so in an engaging way. At first, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of icons on my mini map, indicating the vast number of collectibles, side quests and other bits and pieces to investigate. However, I never got the same sense of 'chore' that often happens in those situations. I think this is primarily because the game navigation and combat is SO GOOD. I didn't use the fast travel system in the game to get anywhere; swinging around Manhatten and watching Spider-Man effortlessly navigate anything that gets in his way is fantastic to behold. It's fun in of itself. Coupled with a similar combat style to the Arkham games; one based on counters, fluidity, gadgets and finishing moves - nothing felt like busy-work.Sure some of the random crimes get a little repetitive at times, especially if you're looking to 100% it (it's actually my first platinum trophy and apparently one of the easier games to 100%), but there's enough variance and distraction to keep you going. Each crime has a series of challenges to max your score, for example. All of the collectables add up to allow gadget, gear and suit unlocks - some of which are very cool.I'm in the midst of Red Dead Redemption 2 at the moment but once I'm done roaming the wild west, I'll be straight back to New York, with the DLC packs in hand :D

The definitive Spider-Man experience.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 September 2018Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
I have no doubts in calling this the best superhero game I've ever played. Leagues ahead of anything Spider-Man has had before where video games are concerned and taking from and improving upon the best aspects of titles like the Batman Arkham games.The game looks absolutely stunning and maintains a steady frame-rate throughout no matter how hectic things get, and they get very hectic, very fast on multiple occasions throughout the games lengthy, yet gripping main story, which incorporates an all-star cast of iconic Spider-Man characters both friend and foe and does them all justice, nobody feels like they don't get a moment in the spotlight in this game's story and this is in large part thanks to the superb voice acting across the entire cast.The game's highly detailed rendition of Manhattan is a blast to explore with the games fast, responsive web-swinging and the collectibles, whilst plentiful, never feel like they slow things down due to how well they compliment the fast-paced nature of Spider-Man's movement.Combat is where the influence from the Arkham series is at its most abundant, but here it's been made a lot faster and significantly more challenging in places with a variety of web shooters and other gadgets to give players the upper hand in fights against increasingly well-armed enemies who will punish players who are blindly mashing buttons and not paying attention to timing every move so as to avoid being blindsided by a far off enemy training their weapon on Spidey.As far as I'm concerned this is as close to a perfect Spider-Man game as we have ever gotten and I can't wait to see what Insomniac do with the franchise next.

Not much of a improvement over GoPro 11.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 September 2023Style Name: H12 BlackPattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I purchased the GoPro 12 Black on the very first day of its release, eager to discover any significant differences from my trusty 11 Black. Here are my takeaways:1. Speedy Menus and Responsiveness: Gone are the lags and delays. The menus are now fast and responsive.2. Carry Case Absence: Unfortunately, GoPro doesn't include a carry case, which can be disappointing if you don't already have one.3. 1/4"" Mounting Addition: The addition of a 1/4"" mounting option at the bottom is a welcome feature. However, if you're already invested in the GoPro ecosystem, you probably have numerous backward-compatible items with the standard GoPro mounting mechanism.Picture Quality:In bright daylight, there's a negligible difference in picture quality between the 11 and the newly released 12 Black. Details are represented similarly in standard mode.  GP-Log: GP-Log seems pretty much useless, as it's challenging to grade and not particularly useful.  HDR: The HDR mode is decent, but the reproduction of details in bright areas appears somewhat artificial to me. Dark areas are slightly lifted compared to standard mode. However, you're limited to a frame rate of 30, and you can only shoot at certain ratios – there's no open gate 8:7 (entire sensor readout).  Voice and Earphone Controls: While I haven't tested these features yet, the addition of voice control and earphone control is a welcome addition to the GoPro family.  Low-Light Performance: Unfortunately, there hasn't been any noticeable improvement in low-light performance compared to the Hero 11.  Picture Brightness: The pictures are bright, and detail reproduction is okay, but subpar with newly released smartphones. Can be used as a whole but when cropped the fall of details is significant.  Hypersmooth 6.0: I couldn't discern any substantial difference between Hypersmooth 6.0 and 5.0 from the Hero 11.  Autoboost: Autoboost is a nice feature that dynamically adjusts the strength of the Hypersmooth stabilization. It's particularly useful for those engaging in dynamic sports.The product itself is solid and well-made, with slightly improved responsiveness. However, I did encounter a camera crash during the initial firmware update, which was perilously close to bricking itself. Thankfully, a manual update via SD card resolved the issue.In summary, if you can find a used Hero 11 Black on sale or a promotional offer for around £300-350, it might be a better choice. Otherwise, if you're in the market for a new GoPro, the 12 Black is a viable option. In my opinion, it should be named the GoPro 11 Black S, as the improvements make it feel like a patched version of the 11 Black.For low light it is still a no-go(pro), Action 4 could be a better option for you.

                Not much of a improvement over GoPro 11.

            I purchased the GoPro 12 Black on the very first day of its release, eager to discover any significant differences from my trusty 11 Black. Here are my takeaways:1. Speedy Menus and Responsiveness: Gone are the lags and delays. The menus are now fast and responsive.2. Carry Case Absence: Unfortunately, GoPro doesn't include a carry case, which can be disappointing if you don't already have one.3. 1/4"" Mounting Addition: The addition of a 1/4"" mounting option at the bottom is a welcome feature. However, if you're already invested in the GoPro ecosystem, you probably have numerous backward-compatible items with the standard GoPro mounting mechanism.Picture Quality:In bright daylight, there's a negligible difference in picture quality between the 11 and the newly released 12 Black. Details are represented similarly in standard mode.  GP-Log: GP-Log seems pretty much useless, as it's challenging to grade and not particularly useful.  HDR: The HDR mode is decent, but the reproduction of details in bright areas appears somewhat artificial to me. Dark areas are slightly lifted compared to standard mode. However, you're limited to a frame rate of 30, and you can only shoot at certain ratios – there's no open gate 8:7 (entire sensor readout).

Luxurious Locks with the Shark FlexStyle 5-in-1: A Game Changer for Hair Styling
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 December 2023Colour Name: Black / Rose GoldStyle Name: With storage caseVerified Purchase
The Shark FlexStyle 5-in-1 Air Styler & Hair Dryer has been a delightful addition to my hair care routine, transforming it into a luxurious and efficient experience. With its innovative design and multiple attachments, including auto-wrap curlers, a paddle brush, and an oval brush, this tool has elevated my hair styling process, making it faster, more versatile, and yielding professional results right at home.What I love most about this styler is how quickly and efficiently it dries my hair without causing any damage. The fast-drying aspect is a massive bonus for someone with a busy lifestyle. It's not just about the speed; the quality of drying leaves my hair feeling soft, with a healthy shine that I can't get enough of. The large paddle brushes are a standout feature for me. They glide through the hair effortlessly, giving my hair a full, voluminous look that lasts all day.Using the FlexStyle, I've noticed a significant improvement in the texture and appearance of my hair. It feels more luxurious, bouncier, and well-maintained. However, while I adore this styler for its many benefits, there's a slight room for improvement, especially concerning the auto-wrap curlers. As someone with Afro hair, I find that the ""tongs"" could be stronger or more adaptive to create more enduring curls. While they do work, enhancing their grip or heat settings might provide that extra hold and longevity that is often needed for tighter curl patterns.In general, I am thrilled with the Shark FlexStyle 5-in-1. It's a fantastic tool that has made hair styling much more enjoyable and less time-consuming. The ease of switching between attachments and the overall performance is commendable. I look forward to every hair day with anticipation, knowing that I can achieve salon-like results with minimal effort. If you're looking for a versatile, high-performing hair styler, the Shark FlexStyle is worth considering. With a slight tweak for stronger curls, it would be unstoppable!

This is a thing of beauty. Sturdy and powerful, it feels good in the hand and can practically be used one handed.The self-wrap curlers are fab once you get used to them, take time to get good at activating the cold shot to lock in the curls. Product beforehand helps too.The cold shot takes a little while to take effect but it’s chilly as hell when it does.The paddles are sleek and catch the hair easily, and in my experience do not cause tangles or pull at the hair. It’s a testament to the love this product must have been created with, using it feels like a luxury.

Having used a Revlon big brush for years (had 3 in total) I’ve found as I’m getting older my hair was becoming increasingly frazzled and even when freshly dried looked very frizzy. I’ve looked at this oroducy several times (as well as the T3 micro and the Dyson products) and eventually made the decision to purchase the shark system on the strength of reviews and the fact my hairdresser advised me he thought the shark product was just as hood if not better than Dyson but less than half the price. I took the plunge when it was on offer and an really glad it did. All those wispy frazzled fly away hairs are a thing of the past, and it dries so incredibly quickly too! I can dry it with the basic drying attachment. In hair dryer mode in about 5 mins (used to take me 20 mins at least with the Revlon big brush to get it to a damp styling level of dryness). Then it takes about another 10 mins to style it with the brush attachments. I have very think long hair. It’s really good and a lot less hair gets pulled out and caught on the brushes.I’ve used the wand attachments too, they take a little more getting used to in terms of technique but each time I use them I get a bit better at it. I’ve used them about 4 times….another few times and I’ll have it cracked.Friends have commented several times that I look like I’ve just had a professional blow dry……I’m really pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it, especially if you can get it when it’s on special offer!

Great, comes in a sturdy fabric case which is great for travelling or storage!The dryer attachment is so good, dries hair so fast compared with other hair dryers. Brush is also great, it leaves hair feeling soft and shiny like straightening your hair. I LOVE the volume brush as jt creates so much volume in the hair which is so great! The air curlers are pretty easy to use and are great for long hair too. The only thing is it doesnt hold the curls in for long however styling mousse helped. I haven't personally used the curing diffuser as i dont have curly hair but it looks good.The flex style can get quite hot however its still touchable heat. I love how you can use no heat and just air. It hasnt heat damaged my hair or anything. Overall i think its great and perfect if you dont want to spend an extra £200 on the dyson!

Haven’t gave it a proper go as it only came today but just switched it on, this hair dryer so so powerful! I gave the hair wrap a quick go too. Seems simple enough to use and very effective. Would recommend using hairspray before using the air wrap. The hair dryer has hot settings and brilliant cold setting. I haven’t had a new hair dryer for about 10 years and my old air dry cold button didn’t work so it’s nice to finally have a hair dryer that does have a brilliant cold setting. Very impressed and excited to use it properly in the morning after I’ve washed my hair.the case it’s came in feel very deluxe too.

Grand Theft Auto VPlayStation 4Rated 18Stats:HD 1080pFrame Rate: 24-30fps1 Player (Offline)2-30 Network Players (Online) [PlayStation Plus subscription required to play online]Compatible with PlayStation VitaRequires 55GB minimum of free hard drive space.Long installation (approx 30-45 mins).Features GTA Online ModePlayers returning must have a Rockstar Social Club account in order to access exclusive loyalty bonuses.Developed by Rockstar NorthPublished by Take-Two Interactive SoftwareStory: How did things get so bad?Michael Townley; a crook teams up with Brad and Trevor for a bank heist in Luddendorf, North Yankton; but things go out of hand, with Brad and Michael being shot by a sniper. Micheal is presumed dead and Brad is presumed to be incarcerated. Michael However is actually living another life as Michael De Santa in Los Santos after he and the Sniper (Dave Norton) struck a deal. Micheal's life seems to go swimmingly... or at least it would have, if Michael didn't catch his wife Amanda in bed with a tennis coach, not happy with his wifes betrayel, he then chases after the tennis coach who leads them back to an hill top mansion; with Michael not thinking it through, he tears down the house and then drives off. This mansion turns out to be owned by the Cartel, headed by Martin Madrazo. Madrazo turns up at Michael's house seeking compensation for the damages caused to his hill top mansion, however Michael doesn't have that kind of money Madrazo is asking for, so he meets up with an old aquaintance Lester. Michael leads a team of people with their own expertise into robbing the Vangelico Jewellery store, the plan was devised by Lester and executed by Michael, but soon after successfully completing the heist; Trevor, an uninvited guest enters Michael's house with unanswered questions: What's Michael been doing and where's Brad? The latter is worked out over the course of the whole game. Dave Norton also struggles to stop the FIB from digging deeper into his and Michael's deal, so Dave enlists certain requests for Michael which are a bit extreme and somewhat dangerous; Soon it becomes apparent that things would soon spiral out of control for Michael and Dave; what with the Merryweather, IAA and the FIB down Daves throat and Trevor down Micheal's, but poor young Franklin is caught in the middle of it all.Story Review:The funniest thing I've seen, heard and played from start to finish, Trevor is just a mess of a guy, but likeable in every heap of the word, with his griminess, foul language and horniness coupled with the fact he hates just about everything society throws at him. Trevor is a force to be reckoned with. Michael just wants to please everybody, even if it means alienating the people he's trying to please. He has a nice house, a nice car and a family that he dotes on so much, even if they are over-ecentric and greedy people. Michael wants peace, but he has to fight for it. Franklin is a character that just wants a better life for himself, but hanging out with Michael and Trevor is not going to give him that, Franklin loses the respect from close family and friends because of his sudden craze for the high life, leaving behind the neighbourhood he grew up in.Gameplay:The game centres around Los Santos and Blaine County and offers different ways to move across the landscape, from driving high powered sports cars, flying various aircraft to swimming underwater. The mission's themselves centre around heists and the overall planning of them, from getting various equipment for the heists, selecting crew, to placing a getaway vehicle. Some of these hiests pay off but others are thwarted by last minute decisions which effect the overall value of them. The character's are also blackmailed to take part in dangerous missions outside of heists by merryweather, FIB and so on. The player is able to switch character's at will by pressing down on the d-pad. As soon as you switch, the character's would be doing some other non player interactions, ie. appearing out of shops or getting chased by the cops. these characters can partake in some activities; be it recreational or just random encounters with other pedestrians; with the recreational activities ranging from tennis, darts, golf, strip clubs, fair ground and movie theatres. The player is able to customise the 3 characters clothing, tattoo's and hairstyle's with the addition to customising guns and cars as well. There are numerous of businesses up for sale too and these would have you doing some errands like driving VIP's across town or saving the business from hooligans; saving the business would ultimately give your selected character their expected weekly allowance.PlayStation 4 Specific Gameplay Enhancements:Grand Theft Auto V features a new first person perspective mode which freshens the game up for returning players, but also adds a new level of fun in the process; you can switch modes by pressing on the Touch Pad. The modes can be used at any time apart from during the cutscenes, as it cuts away to third person mode. Other than this brilliant mode, which is the highlight of this next gen counterpart, the game also utilises the Dualshock 4's light bar to identify which character your playing and flashes blue and red if you're wanted by the police. The Dualshock 4 speaker is used for listening to emergency broadcasts and to receive phone calls.A new Director's Mode has been added which allows you control of any character and record them doing some crazy stuff at your leisure and then edit your masterpiece to showcase to rest of the world via YouTube. This is done by pressing on the touchpad until the pop up appears which allows you to jump into this mode as well as change your character's clothing on the fly.Visuals:The PlayStation 4 version has more texture, ambient lighting and dynamic reflections which make the game more believable. The interiors in the vehicles have the best visuals because they feature rounded objects and various texturing detail that was missing in the PS3 version. There is also a high level of foliage, not just grass, but weeds and flowers too. Los Santos and Blaine County though are teeming with life from birds, cougars, deers, cats, cows/bulls, dolphins, sharks to various dogs. The underwater areas are fully detailed, same as the city and urban areas. The draw distance and weather have been overhauled for Grand Theft Auto V on PS4 with the fact Rockstar have added puddles and surface flooding, where you can actually see water droplets in it, but all this just adds to the immersion of the game and this time around Rockstar North have added more colour to the cities without it looking bland compared to GTA V on PS3. The environment in which you play in, is diverse in the sense of having a countryside, desert region and a mountaineous region drawn together in a photo realistic setting, which is both tranquil and highly detailed.Sound:The radio stations are littered with top tunes from the 80's, 90's with my favourite one coming from Supernatural itself; ya know the one; the one that gets played in ""The road so far"" recap trailer on the very last episode of the season. Yeap... that song. The fact of the matter is, I won't be surprised if everyone has their favourite song being played out at some stage; they're good driving tunes, whether you're cruising down the highway or rolling down a hill, there's a tune for every occasion. If only they did this in real life, I think music would be more interesting. The individual music scores on missions just adds to the awesome music as well and even brings about a certain level of danger and adventure. So what's not to like?GTA Online:Create your character, purchase apartments and engage in a new level of story which is seperate from the main or take part in fun activities with your friends; with Rockstar continously adding updates, you can rest assure that you'll never get bored, with each time you enter GTA Online would be like a new experience. Returning players can transfer their character to PS4 from GTA Online on PS3.Conclusion:GTA V for Xbox One, PS4 and PC is really fantastic and really shows just how commited Rockstar Games are at providing new content for online in addition to improving elements of the whole game which in turn keeps GTA V fresh, new & exciting when you come back to it. just when I put the game in a cupboard to rot, Rockstar present some new excuse for me to get the game out again which is great. I love GTA and I hope you'll love it too, It's the go to game, if you want to have some laid back fun.

 ♦ Introduction ♦Grand Theft Auto V first came out on the

Xbox 360
 late 2013; it did amazingly well in sales and was a game that truly stretched the last-gen consoles to their limits.  To many this was not only an absolutely stunning looking game, but a really enjoyable one to play too.During the game you get to play with three different characters:∙ Michael: A ""retired"" bank robber.∙ Franklin: Works for a luxury car dealership as a repossession guy.∙ Trevor: A former military pilot who is a bank robber, drug/weapons dealer & stereotypical redneck; this guy is absolutely insane!Apart from times where the storyline solely concentrates on one character, you can freely switch between each character who has different skills/abilities.  They might be near to the character you've recently switched from, or could be over the other side of the map!  In all honesty, I really liked this aspect of the game.That all said, I wasn't quite sure if I was going to dig deep in my pockets to pay full price for a game I already own, just to have it on a different console.  As the game was nearing to its release, the more I saw about the improvements which were being made to the game; it wasn't too long before I pre-ordered my copy.♦ Box Contents & Game Information ♦- Inside the case: GTAV game disc | Instruction manual | Game world map | $500,000 In-game credit voucher (main game & online)*.* Subject to availability: This was supposed be an incentive to pre-order the game, so depending on when you buy the game, you may not get this voucher.- Game Information: 1 Player (Main Game) | 2-30 Players (Online) | Requires a minimum of 55GB storage space | Supports remote play.- Trophies: 1 Platinum | 3 Gold | 5 Silver | 42 Bronze.♦ What's New? ♦∙ Plays at 1080p at 30fps (Up from 720p which the last-gen consoles played in).∙ First Person Mode: Play GTAV like you've never played it before!∙ Major graphics improvement (cleaner look, more realistic, better lighting/reflections and less frame-dropping).∙ All extra DLC that was available for the PS3/Xbox comes included on day release.∙ 161 New songs added to the game (Now that's a big increase!).∙ ""Improved"" Online performance: I can see this happening once the servers settled down, anyone remember what happened last time?The above is what I know of so far; I will update if I find out any further information.- First Person Mode -This mode is quickly activated upon pressing down the touch panel.There are a tonne of available options to cater for this new mode:∙ First Person Control Type: Standard | Alternate | Southpaw | Alt+South | Std FPS | Alt FPS | South FPS | Alt_South FPS | + More.∙ First Person Look-Around Sensitivity: Sensitive Bar.∙ First Person Aiming Sensitivity: Sensitive Bar.∙ First Person On Foot Field of View: Sensitive Bar.∙ First Person Ragdoll: On | Off.∙ First Person Combat Roll: On | Off.∙ First Person Head Bobbing: On | Off.∙ First Person Third Person Cover: On | Off.This mode may require some practice & tweaking of settings to get used to, however it may just be a love or hate option at the end of the day.- Improved Graphics -There's not really much I can say... This game looks like I would have never imagined it before because I thought it already looked great, so seeing it being improved again really is icing on the cake.Textures, lighting, overall graphics... It all looks amazing.♦ Final Thoughts ♦The improvements made to this game are pretty darn significant.  If you thought GTAV looked out of this world on the last-gen consoles then hold on to your seat because you're about to be blown away.Now, if you've played this game on any of the last-gen consoles and didn't enjoy it, buying this game won't change your mind; sure you can appreciate how much better it looks and even smoother play, but it's highly likely you still won't enjoy the game.For those who enjoyed playing this game on either the PS3 or Xbox 360, trust me, you won't be wasting your money purchasing this game again.Would highly recommend.► Note: I've included a little video to show off the graphics and first person mode.  I kept it short as it's very hard to capture footage without having the main character or someone on the street shouting out some kind of profanity.

I love the setlist on this game and, although the campaign's quite short (you can complete it in one afternoon/evening!), Guitar Hero TV is what it's about. It's effectively two music channels with an overlay on so even though you can't choose the song, you can choose the channel... so there's a good chance you'll find a track you like. The new controller's quite easy to pick up and I personally prefer it over the older GH games. Great for parties but you'll need two controllers! You can also use the PS Camera as a microphone for someone to sing along during Quick Play mode. Can't rate this highly enough - genuinely fun, well-made game.

Brilliant!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2015Platform For Display: PlayStation 4Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
Activision have once again outdone themselves with a fantastic take on the new guitar hero live! It is much harder than the original 5 coloured button guitar, and uses 6 in a 2x3 layout. I find this layout easier myself. Not a musician so I don't understand the elements of a guitar very well, but the new layout gives perspective on how to actually hold a guitar whilst at the same time not stretching muscles I your hand too far! Great game and great guitar controller!  Best thing about the game is the GHTV on which you can play with other players in a live playlist accessible to everyone, or e last few days in the Christmas holidays (2015) they had guests on the live playlist like Avenged Sevenfold.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 October 2015Platform For Display: PlayStation 4Edition: StandardVerified Purchase
WARNING SPOILERS!I'm reviewing this as a player who has played most of the old GHs. I used to play pretty well at expert but no where near pro.Graphics: stunning. Time has definitely gone into making sure this game looks beautiful. The menus, icons, fonts etc all look really nice and the graphics while playing are really detailed. It's actually real people in the crowd, backstage and playing in the band with you which makes it feel like your important and motivated to play well. The only slight niggle I can make is that it doesn't go out all the way, there is a line in the crowd where the people turn into computer generated characters, but it's hardly noticeable and I'm sure would have cost a lot for something which probably wouldn't add much benefit to the effect.Intro and TutorialThe intro is pretty smooth, I liked it. It flows very well and immerses you straight into the game and tutorial. The tutorial was good, but I feel a bit short and they could have prepared you more for how difficult the game can be.GameplayThe buttons: let's get this out of the way early, the buttons are displayed in two rows of three. Is this better or worse than the old style of 5 buttons on one row? Neither. I think it's a nice change, but I also think they made a big mistake here. They had to come up with something new, keeping it the same might have been too stale for newcomers. However, I think they forgot about people who used to play GH, who no doubt loved playing with 5 fingers. I used to get a real buzz out of moving my 4 fingers down to the last 4 buttons and then back up again. It also meant playing sequences of hammer ons was really fun. The part they made a mistake on was not giving the option to the player, in my opinion there should have been 5 buttons top and bottom and then the player can choose to turn off multiple rows. Playing 2 rows definitely feels more like a real guitar, but not moving your fingers along the buttons doesn't feel like a real guitar. They have added something cool but removed something which was loved. I may also be saying this because I am not good at two rows, I have played a lot over the last few days and I just find it too hard to play on expert and even advanced with 2 rows. I'm not a real guitar player so I doubt I will ever get good at this and for me that ruins the fun. The other annoying thing is that black notes are on the top and white on the bottom, but the white notes are much brighter and give signal to my brain to press the top row as the 'main' row and the bottom one black as the secondary. I think again an option to swap the colours would have been good here. They have now also added a strum bar for when you don't need to press a button, again nice edition as its similar to how the drums used to be. Finally, the notes show up as plectrums, which in my opinion are too big and make things more confusing, I preferred the old flat note look. It also makes it difficult to notice differences in notes (such as when you have star power going but it's also a hammer on).Star power: you now don't seem to fill up a bar but more so just hit a couple of streams of star power buttons correctly and a plectrum lights up and you enable in the same old ways. They have simplified this which I think makes it a bit boring. You can also get different star power activators such as a bomb which instantly makes all notes that appear to be automatically played. You can unlock others too which I think is cool.Highway: similar to before really. You can unlock other highways which is cool. Nothing more to say!Score: scoring works similar as in 5 stars is the max you can get and you get points that total up to get to each star and star power helps to get more. You also get a multiplier up to 4x (8x with star power), but for some reason they removed all this for 'story mode'? Didn't like that.Playing optionsGH Live: this is basically story mode but done in a way that you are the main guitarist for a band and play sets at festivals. I really liked this as it leads you up to the final gig in a way the previous GHs didn't. If you get certain stars and scores you unlock some pictures (which is pointless, it should unlock something better than that). Another thing which makes it feel real is you have commentary as if it's a festival and also a bar at the bottom of the screen with fake tweets by people saying how well you played. I did feel although there is a lot I liked about this part of the game, it felt too simple, was over too quickly as there is only two main venues, and it felt like it wasn't the main part of the game.GH TV: great idea. Here is what is essentially a hub and what feels like the main focus for the game. You can either play single tracks or playlists of your choice as normal (loads unlocked but you can unlock more). Or you can play GH TV which is basically a place where there is fake music channels that play 24 hours a day (similar to Scuzz or Kerrang). You join in while songs are playing and start playing the song and you can stay there as long as you like. The great thing about this is the actual music videos of the songs play in the background, which is really cool. It also removes the highway during parts of the song where you don't need to play so you can watch the video rather than twiddling your thumbs. It's a great idea and great part of the game. GH TV is a hub and therefore has other things like coins which you collect, Hero Cash (which is a currency you can buy with real money) and 'Plays'. Plays are used to play any of the songs on the list. You can get these easily, but it basically means you don't need to buy songs with real money like before, you just use a Play but don't own the music afterwards. I'm sure some people will hate the idea of Hero Cash, as its similar to in app cash on phones, but I think it's better than paying for individual songs. Another cool feature is you play live v other people and you can see where you rank from 1st to 10th in the bar next to the highway as your playing.MenusAgain, great menu graphics, but personally I think they've gone down the ""too simple"" route with tiles like in Windows 8 which I must say I absolutely hate. It makes it feel too basic with not much depth.CalibrationThe manual calibration tool is rubbish. Not very helpful and I couldn't use it to work out where the calibration needed to be set to. Luckily they have an auto calibration feature which seemed to work ok.Guitar and setupEasy to setup, Bluetooth receiver worked fine. Guitar looks cool and not cheapy. Buttons and strum bar are a bit squeaky though and should feel a little loser. Maybe this comes with wear.SummaryOverall an average game with lots of effort put into it. Definitely does not feel rushed. I do however think they missed quite a few tricks to make it an amazing game. I'm glad I bought it to try it, but I won't play it much as I'm not getting the full satisfaction I was expecting out of this great franchise unfortunately. It has a lot more style than substance and feels as though they have removed a lot of features which should have been kept it. If you're new to GH, you might love it.

Great whisky and good value at £50; becomes a must-buy on offer < £40
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 December 2023Style Name: 8 Year OldVerified Purchase
There's loads of reviews of Lagavulin 8 that delve into the nose, taste & finish in far better detail than I ever could, so I'll just say this - many people will buy the 8 instead of the 16 due to the latter's ever-rising price, but don't think of the 8 as simply a cheap replacement that's not as good. The 8 doesn't have the same complexity & depth as the 16, but it's got a surprisingly different flavour profile and on it's own merits ranks as an absolutely great whisky.I didn't need to buy this, as I already had bottles of both the 8 & 16 at home, which likely would last me the next 12-18 months - Lagavulin is great, but not an every-day dram for me (more of a Speyside fan). However, when it popped up on the front page at £38 on offer (normally £50-55), I had to pick up some more. I wouldn't be surprised if this is the last time we see Lagavulin 8 below £40, particularly based on Diageo's huge price bumps for the 16 (~40-50% increase in the UK between 2020 and now; some markets like Australia & the US have seen prices jump nearly 100% in that same period).Grab it while it's cheap, because it's not going to last.

An Absolute Icon of Scotch, This is One of the Best Drinks in Existence
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 June 2022Style Name: 16 Year OldVerified Purchase
Ah Lagavulin 16, the pinnacle of Scotch, perfection in a bottle and well and truly my ride or die whisky.My whisky journey began a year or so ago when I saw a bottle of Bowmore No. 1 on offer and decided to try it as my partner is from Orkney and I wanted to embrace some of the culture. I'm also a huge lover of Parks and Rec. and Ron Swanson is, in my honest opinion, a true role model. A proper 'man's man', and with an iron clad set of morals and a 'stash to be envious of. When such a man describes something as 'Nectar of the Gods' you know it must be special and I knew I had to try it. Well lo' and behold a bottle appeared for me at Christmas and I opened the box to finally stare at that iconic bottle in the flesh for the first time.I opened the plastic wrapping around the cork and pulled it for the first time, pouring the first of the luscious gold liquid into my glass. I was truly terrified! What if I hated it? What if Mr. Swanson had mislead me? Well in one whiff that fear evaporated all at once. When I finally put the glass to my lips the first time I immediately entered a heaven like no other. Below you'll find my tasting notes which I hope are helpful and perhaps come across to you too:Nose: A classic Islay with a twist. There's smoke there but it's not overwhelming. Maritime with a good amount of sea salt and just the tiniest hint of iodine. It's woody and intense but it takes you to the edge and hangs you off it, then just as you begin to fall pulls you back into a warming embrace. But there's more... A hint of fruit that's unlike your typical Speyside and certainly a world away from other Islays. To give you an idea, picture the smoke of Caol Ila 12, add a hint of the classic Bowmore citrus and crank up the intensity. Then add a dash of tropical fruit and banana not unlike a rum. It's exquisite.Palate: There's smoke immediately but again it doesn't overwhelm. Lagavulin is widely known as one of the smokier single malts and I'd agree but it doesn't punch you in the face in quite the same way as it's neighbouring distilleries of Ardbeg and Laphroaig. It's utterly unique as well in that it flirts with both oiliness and dryness and blends them so flawlessly. Oily in that it coats your mouth and you always know it's there, but dry in that it steps back before it gets too much. Behind the smoke there's more of that odd tropical fruit with saltiness. There's the classic medicinal note of iodine/TCP as well but it's only ever a cameo appearance to remind you that this is an Islay malt. Lagavulin takes you on a deep dive into unknown waters, then just as it all begins to get a bit much it lifts you back to the surface on a wave of fresh mint.Finish: The finish starts with the hint of mint from the palate. Fruitiness steps back forward through the smoke which serves as the bed on which all the other notes sit. It's a long finish and a satisfying one at that. This is a whisky that wants to be remembered.I discovered fairly early on that I'm a fan of Islay, but this is definitely not a whisky for beginners. Start with Highland Park 12 and then try one of the Talisker offerings. Then, when you're ready to make the jump to Islay, go for either of the aforementioned Caol Ila or Bowmore 12 year olds. The Ila will show you the smokier elements whilst with the Bowmore it's the fruit and honey that comes forward. They'll prepare your palate for some of the more intense offerings from this wonderful island.Back to the Lagavulin, to conclude, it's sheer magic in a bottle. Whether you love it or hate it, you'll feel something and feel it intensely. It provokes a response on a deeper level and it's wonderful. My only criticism would be Diageo's shameless price gouging. At 70 quid a bottle it's still a relative steal when you can afford it but I've heard on good authority that the price is like to soon go well over £100. Before that happens do yourself a favour and grab a bottle, even if you save it for later. And if you don't like it, send me the rest! This is my special occasion whisky and the one I always gaze longingly at when financial constraints force me to reach for a cheaper bottle from the cabinet. An absolute marvel of a whisky.

Simply perfect
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 June 2023Style Name: 16 Year OldVerified Purchase
It's just amazing. I was a bit skeptical about it reading all the reviews about it tasting like 'drinking a cigar', 'ash' and so on. It is smokey. But that is perfectly balanced with the sweetness of the vanilla and caramel flavours. On the nose you're first hit by the smoke, however you need to give it another few sniffs to get deeper into the vanilla and caramel sweetness. On the palate the smoke will be there, but not that prominent, definitely not like drinking a cigar. You will need to savour it for a while and this will bring out the vanilla and then caramel flavours. The finish is a long smokey one. I can still taste the subtle smoke after finishing a glass. It's amazing neat and on the rocks. Also makes a perfect smokey cokey, which will bring out the vanilla flavours even more, but will retain the subtle smokiness. It is a truly amazing whisky and you need to savour it properly (smell, taste etc,) to appreciate just how magnificent it is. Overall it is smooth, no burn at all and very easy to drink. It is a bit pricey, but that can be expected from such a gem. If I knew how good this is and if it would be slightly cheaper, I would definitely get two bottles. Highly recommended! There is a reason this has more than 10,000 reviews and a near 5 star rating!

Very interesting whisky...
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 December 2023Style Name: 16 Year OldVerified Purchase
So this is MY personal take on it, YOURS may be very different...It's quite pungent. I get a pleasant medicinal scent (similar to Laphroaig) seeping through burnt oak. It's to the point I'm not sure if this is intentional or that maturing casks have long since had their day, or maybe a result of charring in the malting process. Very peated, with a suggestion of honey and possibly slight marzipan that progresses into a more savoury nuttiness. Very layered, but I can't say either way if this is truly a great whisky or one that's just very different... Certainly not for first time whisky drinkers - You'll either love it or loathe it. I'd recommend buying a small sample bottle first if possible. Hope this helps, good luck.!

All I had to do was to pull out a plastic battery saver tag and then my iPhone detected the tag and it was paired. Real easy to setup and use. Absolutely love my AirTag. Since saved me more grief when I couldn't see my wallet!

Purchased to attach to a child. Before doing so ran a few tests such as directional locating, and even within a  few week it was having trouble sending me in the right direction, in-fact it went in the wrong direction. I has an annoying feature of beeping if left alone for a while (a safety issue to alert people of stalkers). It fairness it's not a GPS, and it's okay to see if your suitcases are in the wrong country (as a friend did with his),. I would no rely on one of these to find a child lost in a busy mall for instance, but on saying that it's better than nothing.Set up was a pain, we had all sorts of trouble as they lock themselves into devices and if you try to move to another phone and don't free them up first on the first device, well good luck getting it to work, which is why I put easy to use only 3 stars. Some install quick and easy, some go horribly wrong

The range of questions vary from pretty easy to quite hard so there should be something for any age or knowledge level of the films / books.500 questions gives quite a bit of variety. I’d love to see an even bigger pack, but these seem fair value for money.The nice thing is that a set of cards gives the option for people to interact and share face to face rather than be lost looking at phones. The questions often get people talking about the film or scene that it relates too, so nice for starting conversations and nostalgia too!

As with EVERY flavour of prime, if you blindfolded yourself and tested it against the same flavour of many, fraction of the price, other brands, then you'de struggle to find anything outstanding enough in it to say ""yes that's prime"".It's a nice enough taste. But when you consider you could buy three top end cordials, that to be honest would taste on par, IF NOT BETTER (since you add it to your own taste) then it kind of puts it into perspective the actual waste of money this product is.

from fat to fit
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2010Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
I have finally found hope that I can lose the two stone I have gained since my working life changed to a very sedentary one of 10 hour days. I hate gyms, and most evenings am just too tired to do much except flop on the sofa with a glass of wine. This does not help!Within a very short time I have become very fond of this fitness tool. It completely adapts to my lifestyle, is always there, and lets me choose what I want to do in the comfort of my own home. No wasted gym fees or travel time to and from a gym. No depressing realisation of how out of shape I am compared with the gym rats around me.The system personalises itself to you in so many ways -it is a pleasure to start it up and do the body test, see the pounds dropping off. How lovely to see the downward slope of my BMI graph, pointing straight at the target I have set.Unlike a gym, it;'s great fun, whether done alone or in company. It's something my daughter and I can do together when it suits us, and get fit at the same time. The games are entertaining and make you laugh too -something that never happened in a gym!This is the answer to my need to get fit and stay fit -it really makes it easy, and with no recurring fees. Once you've bought it, that's it. Maybe around 2 months' worth of gym fees but get to keep it for life.Best of all it has given me hope again and lifted a despondency that I would be stuck in unfitness and all that that would bring. It has actually made me happier!

Family fun even for technophobes
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2010Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
Bought this item as a family present at Christmas to accompany the Wii console we got last year.  Even the unpacking instructions on the box were a really clever touch, and the balance board is so sturdy.  A really well put together piece of kit.Setting up was as easy as adding a new controller, flick the switch, press the button & presto, you're ready.  Lob in the CD to the console and start.  All the Mii's from the plaza come over and the information previously stored does too.You start by being weighed and tested to give you a Wii-fit age which can be part of a daily routine with this item (or not).  The down side is that if you are not that good at some of the tests your age goes up, so you have to take it with a pinch of salt / don't be too serious about it.If you want some fun there are plenty of games that hide the fact that you are actually working some muscles (until later when you ache) and for the fitness gurus, there are yoga and muscle workouts too.  The latter are really common sense exercises that perhaps most of us wouldn't normally think to do but they work well.  You can set yourself targets and burn off some calories and it has enough good sense to remind you to take a break too.As an over 40, my wife and I both enjoy playing on it regularly.  The kids, like fireworks, burned brightly on it for a fortnight and have now fizzled out a bit, possibly with getting back to school.Even guests who pop round succumb to playing on it.  Absolute winner.

Better than Wii Fit
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2009Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
Having had Wii Fit for over a year and been quite frustrated by the time it takes to work through the routines I was very keen to give this a try to see if there was an improvement over the original.  It certainly is,  you get everything you had with the Wii Fit plus a number of extras.There is quite a lot that is new on Wii Fit Plus, some of it is a novelty like the ability to add in either your pets or a baby - all that does is allow you to weigh them on a regular basis so that you can check their weight. Helpful if you have pets you are trying to slim down and useful perhaps if you want to check your baby's progress but don't worry they aren't allowed to exercise so Nintendo haven't 'lost the plot'.There is the facility to plan a workout although the only sections you can choose from are the Yoga and the Muscle exercises. This is a handy little feature as it totals up the time so you can choose the right number of workouts to fill say a half hour slot and then use that on a regular basis. If I have a criticism of this feature it is that it only appears to let you have one custom workout stored at any one time - I would have preferred the ability to store half a dozen.That said there are some preset routines which you can choose from to allow you to work on specific targets such as fitness, flexibility etc and this is very useful. If you prefer you can also ask the Wii Fit to design a routine for you.I do love this flexibility because very often I want to do a half hour workout and I used to hate waiting for all the interval between exercises. The slight downside is that it doesn't score your performance for each exercise but in any event that used to get tedious to me so I am pleased that I can now avoid it.Nintendo have also added a whole new section of fun 'games' called Training Plus which include things like skateboarding, snowball fights, flying like a bird, juggling - I could go on and on. I have tried them all and they are good fun, some more so than others from my perspective, but I think it is fair to say that there is something for everyone in that section and they would be hilarious at a party as some of them are especially tricky to master. If I have a criticism of this section it is that I would have liked some instructions on how to do them but to be honest once you have tried and got a rotten score you soon learn what you should be doing to do better!I love the fact that Nintendo have also introduced a little brain work into the exercises as well. One of the features when it works out your brain age required me to balance whilst clicking on random numbers in ascending order - sounds simple but when you are trying to keep your centre of gravity in the centre and use you brain to select numbers you do need to concentrate. Similarly in one of the fun games you have to swing your hips to hit 'mushrooms' whose numbers add up to 10 which means doing quick mental arithmetic whilst exercising - great fun and a good way to smarten up your mental arithmetic.Other new features includes the provision of a MET Value - A MET value is added to each exercise, in order to calculate calories burnt. MET stands for ""metabolic equivalent"" and is defined as ""the ratio of the work metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate"". Sounds complicated but in practice it just gives you an idea of how many calories you have burnt during your workout which is useful.Nintendo have provided some expanded training modes - Aerobic & Jogging both have additional courses, Step Rhythm Remix includes new songs. There are 3 new Yoga exercises and 3 new Muscle exercises. All this plus the option for Multiplayer mode to allow all the family to join in.So do I think it is worth buying - yes I do,  it has renewed my interest in keeping fit and that can't be a bad thing.

A Game Changer in Streaming Devices!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 February 2024Style Name: HD SnowVerified Purchase
I recently purchased the Chromecast with Google TV (HD), and it has completely transformed my TV viewing experience.The setup was straightforward and user-friendly. It was as simple as plugging the device into my TV’s HDMI port, connecting it to my Wi-Fi, and following the on-screen instructions.The interface is clean and intuitive. It’s easy to navigate through the various apps and settings. The addition of Google TV is a significant upgrade, offering a more personalized experience by recommending content based on my viewing habits.The remote control is compact and has a minimalist design. It includes quick access buttons for YouTube and Netflix, which I found very convenient. The voice control feature, powered by Google Assistant, works flawlessly and makes searching for content a breeze.The streaming quality is excellent. I’ve been able to stream HD content without any buffering or lagging issues. The device also supports a wide range of apps, including all the major streaming services.One of the standout features for me is the Google Home integration. Being able to control my TV with my Google Home devices adds a level of convenience that I didn’t know I needed.In conclusion, the Chromecast with Google TV (HD) offers great value for its price. It’s a versatile streaming device that delivers on its promises. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their TV viewing experience.

Very good overall, and excellent value!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2024Style Name: 4K SnowVerified Purchase
I really like this Chromecast (prior to this I had used an Amazon Fire TV Cube, 3rd gen). However, compared to the Cube, this is noticeably slower in navigating around the UI and YouTube side menu... it can be choppy/sluggish at times. That being said, it doesn't feel particularly irritating, it's just something to be mindful of and is mostly fine. But to help mitigate this, I have a button remap app installed and for my use case I've just set three of the buttons to open the three apps I mostly/only use (Plex, Prime, and YouTube): the YouTube button can be left as-is obviously, so I've set the Netflix button to open Plex, and the mute button (not something I use) to open Amazon Prime. That works really well for me, and find I rarely need to return to the home screen. I'm considering printing up some coloured circular labels for the buttons too, just because I think it would be a fun thing to do! Seems like it would be simple enough.The remote is pretty good I'd say... IMO it could stand to be a little longer as it's just a tad on the short side (I'm 6ft guy with medium hands), but really it doesn't feel too bad, and I especially like the soft clicks as compared to the Amazon Fire remote (for example). The volume keys take a bit of getting used to as they're on the top-right edge; muscle memory being what it is I've come to expect the vol. keys to be on the face of the remote. I have paired a Fire remote with this and that works fine, but I'd like to see if I can get used to this one first.The wi-fi on this ain't great. I have a gigabit fibre connection and I'm still only getting around 85Mbps download speed. Considering the typical download speed on my Google Pixel is around 700Mbps, and on ethernet 900Mbps+, I was hopeful to take advantage of that. No such luck. But even at 85Mbps it's still enough for 4k. Just seems a shame to not be capable of utilising such high speeds :/The initial set up of this Chromecast was WAY easier than I expected too, I didn't need to involve the use of my phone (via certain Google apps) which was a surprise, as I was fully expecting that to be the case. This was even quicker to setup than my Fire TV Cube, and that's saying something!Overall, I would say this is exceptional value for money, what minor negative points it has are greatly outweighed by the many positives (an option for 'Apps Only' mode being one of them!). So glad to have gotten it, and would easily recommend it.

 I actually bought the Chromecast from this seller due to the good reviewsI am not really sure to be honest why I needed one, except my husband kept going on and on how fabulous they were.So I took the plunge when it was Amazon prime week, and got the promotion. The cost at the time was £33.32, however had a £10 voucher, so added it. So the final costing £29.98. The price has gone back to the original and current cost of £58.78.So basically the Chromecast is a dongle that fits either at the side of your TV or the back, depending on the model.Arrived the next day with Prime, and to be honest wasn’t in a good place to get excited because all these type things come to me to sort with passwords etc as I am the one that knows them all.I left it a day, and felt much better the next day. I need not have worried, apart from putting the dongle in the Hisense TV, I just followed the instructions. One thing that always happens to me, same with “Alexa” takes an age for the wifi to connect. The initial set up was easy, remember to download the app on your phone so you can cast to the TV. Everything was fine and eventually worked well after twenty minutes for a decent signal from my wifi to connect, tried re-booting the signal, plug in and out etc. Eventually worked. I do get this issue with everything that needs to be synced. I had the same issue when on Virgin BB, now the same with the new provider. Maybe walls etc to close to the hub, I am not sure, but anyway, the main thing I got it up and running.We have just had our Pagan wedding review and had a stack of photos and my husband thought you could just cast from my phone and magically will appear on screen, well if it does, I have yet to suss that one out. According to Google, I have to download Google photo app to show on screen. So I downloaded the app, but in truth not looked on the TV as yet.Unlike Netflix which I can watch in any room, the Chromecast only works on one TV at a time, so although everything comes through my TV in my downstairs bedroom, I would need to remove the dongle into the living room.One thing I wasn’t happy about, the dongle overlaps two ports on the back back of my TV. My TV size in the bedroom is 43-46”. The dongle is big, and because of this and the overlapping of the port, I had to remove my NOW TV stick. So not happy about that. Why such a big dongle, some ports from different makes of TV maybe fine.Another beef I have on the white control panel. So a scenic for you as I did it. I was watching for the umpteenth time Vikings, I got it ready and got in bed to watch with my husband. I clicked play, and it went back to the beginning of season one. Same with anything I watch, if I pause a film and press the button it goes off and I have to redo the lot again, this is a pain, as a program with a lot of seasons is a nightmare as it just will not pause and start in the same place. If I say paused to go for a toilet break, then hit play, it comes on fine, but leaving more than five minutes, the screensaver comes on and all lost, so basically I do not bother setting anything up if I am going to be a while.I feel although the white control feels nice in the hand, there just isn’t enough to work with.Now for the actual streaming, majority of what we have watched is pretty good, maybe because I have ultra 4K not sure, but going from Netflix to say you tube is very fast, better than using Netflix from the TV.The volume on the side of the control doesn’t work unless you set it up correctly, go up to at least 80. Not that you will need it that loud, but I find it useful when watching old films that are not good quality.Chromecast hasn’t got many apps at all, and certain ones to use need a subscription. I would have thought Now TV would be on there, but it isn’t, so that makes a mockery of having all the apps in one place.Google do need to change the Chromecast, it is a bit behind some of the leaders. Firstly it is quite costly if other people want to watch their own device, the Chromecast isn’t multifunctional with all family members, only one.Not all channels from your TV will show on Chromecast. For example channel 4 etc. So you may have to source it from free view or freesat etc.There are a lot of you tube videos that actually are pretty good if you wanted to get the best out of it.It is nice to have just the one controlSo I have gone through some basics, some maybe irrelevant, some maybe useful, I am still learning.I do like the colour of the control and the Google assist works wellI am getting used to just one control instead of three, so that’s a bonus.It is a useful device, and I do use the Chromecast everyday,I have given 4* because there are more apps that should and could be included, and that being said, free apps..If you have a standard definition TV, maybe more advantageous having ultra HD or similar.Amazon works well and Netflix.I would only buy the Chromecast when on offer, I got a good price, so quite happy.

Simply Brilliant!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2023Platform For Display: PlayStation 5 Standard EditionVerified Purchase
A truly wonderful game. It excels in terms of atmosphere and immersion. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. Not only that, the game mechanics, especially the shooting, is incredibly solid. It feels very satisfying when you put down an enemy. I found the environment extremely interesting throughout the entire game; nothing felt rehashed or boring. There's a lot of variety with the enemies too, quite a few one off special monsters, some of which are genuinely frightening.The game feels like a piece of art to me with many intricately designed and impressive looking buildings. There's even a huge and spectacular castle. They are all filled with intriguing contraptions, old style furniture, creepy looking statues, stuffed animals, and sellable antiques to find, all set in a world of gloomy forests, forbidding precipices, caves and rustic villages. It's all painstakingly crafted by a team of highly talented artists.The bosses are varied, challenging and satisfying. In addition, the shop keeper system is extremely good. It keeps you motivated to hunt for treasures to get money to upgrade your gear.It's quite a lengthy game, and, in the end, you feel like you have been on a huge adventure.Capcom just keeps on delivering the goods! I think they are the best gaming company in the world at the time of writing. They just keep on producing great games (which are not broken at launch, a rare thing these days). The only Resident Evil Remake that they didn't nail was Resident Evil 3, but boy did they make up for it with this one, BIG TIME.Also, I just bought the DLC for this game, and, DAM, Capcom delivered yet again. Their DLC for Village was pure class and this one is just as good. And it only costs £7.99! And for that you get a whole lot for your money.In summary, if you like horror, action, atmosphere and great characters, then this is the game for you!

One of the best horror games I've played (which is not a lot)
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 June 2023Platform For Display: PlayStation 5 Standard EditionVerified Purchase
Resident Evil 4 Remake (or RE4R for short), is an intense survival horror game that will keep your toes up throughout the whole game.As a first time in the series, I thought it was Really fun, even though I am typically too scared to play these games. The gameplay is easy to understand, you have limited amount of space that you need to manually organise so you can fit weapons, ammo, resources (used to craft) and health to use throughout the whole game; you can also buy more space and certain locations with the money and treasures you've found on your path, which also can give you new weapons as well; and while it may still seem small, with how much ammo, health and resource you waste, you are going to be glad that you got that extra space.There are a variety of weapons in the game, some you'll use often and some that will be last resort stuff.The enemies are also tough, even some of the weaker enemies when there are hordes of them, and while some have weaknesses, you better be prepared as your resources will be drained (I even had points where i had no ammo found for ages after the encounters or before), though luckily they leave some. Especially when it comes to bosses, which I barely survived one of them in my first attempt.The story of the game is fun, the main character you play, Leon, is tasked to save the presidents Daughter, from this place somewhere in presumably Spain. The characters are charming, especially Leon, who you will love someway or another. Also if you like some lore, this game is packed with it, and I will probably check the other games in the series for this reason as well, besides everything else of course.The graphics are also really good looking, and the game has a few options that allow you to improve it more with stuff like raytracing or strand-based hair if you desire. The game has a really stable framerate at 60fps that I didn't notice any hiccups at all besides one part that didn't occur when I Respawned; though I played it in framerate mode, which has lower resolution than Resolution mode, so it might be a bit unstable in that mode but I haven't checked.Conclusion, if you want a intense survival horror game with a fun story with characters and lore you want to know more, I think this game is for you.

The Best Resident Evil Game
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 September 2023Platform For Display: PlayStation 5 Standard EditionVerified Purchase
I've played all the Resident Evil games ever since PS1 days. Loved them all.  I have been enjoying the remakes over the last few years, RE2 was amazing, RE3 was good, if a little short, and finally we have RE4.  Not only is this the best Resident Evil remake, it's also the best Resident Evil game ever made.  It's even better than RE Village. It's well paced, has great voice acting, good graphics, excellent lighting, and a wide variety of enemies.  It is more intense and to survive you will need to keep your wits about you and adopt different tactics. I recommend also the excellent dlc ""Separate Ways"" where you play Ada Wong's side. A good 7 or 8 hours long campaign that is really well done.  I give this game a strong 10/10, a masterpiece of survival horror and is highly recommended.

Cure, prevention and mutant fleas.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 May 2017Verified Purchase
I have used Indorex for years now. At first I used it after a terrible flea season during which time we had 2 dogs and 3 cats. We seemed to be living in a flea infested hovel. The dogs, cats and humans were all itchy and incredibly grouchy and the fleas were obviously having the house party from heaven. Once I'd washed all the bedding, vacuumed everywhere and wiped the entire house down I sprayed this on everything. It worked impressively well and is so simple to use that I reckon my dog could have used it if all the humans had been eaten by mutant fleas.We use it as a preventative now by spraying twice to three times a year on all the soft furnishings, pet and human beds.. Our pets have no problem with it and as long as you stick to the instructions you won't choke to death.- Harmful by inhalation - Don't spray for too long otherwise you'll be seeing stars or those cute birdies from the cartoons.- Irritating to skin - So are fleas and dust mites, but just in case don't use this as a deodorant.- Extremely flammable - No flamethrower usage whilst spraying.

Our cat had fleas on her, (despite us flea treating her), so we bought a stronger flea product along with this to treat the house.It was really easy to use and we never saw any fleas anywhere after using this.Great product, just leave the window open whilst using it.

It works.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2023Verified Purchase
So I saw flea dirt on my kitten, not realising it was flea dirt at the time. 2 weeks later were over run with fleas. I'm sitting on the sofa and one just walks past be like it owns the place. I was in bed and I saw one crawling along my duvet. That was my last straw. I sprayed the whole house, it took about 1.5 cans (3 bed terrece), whilst I left my kitten in the kitchen, fully ventilated.My kitten still has lots of fleas, which I feel so bad about , but I couldn't hoover everyday as I got the flu. I know there's fleas in the house, but I don't see them, which is much better than before and actually I see random dead ones around occasionally so I know it works.It's quite easy to spray, and but it is very potent. The flea spray won't work on its own, you need flea cwt8 pills , hoover and washing clothes on hot wash.I'm taking stars away because its doubled in price over 2 weeks. The price I paid for two is the same price as 1. That's really unacceptable,in that short space of time, and I can't afford to buy that anymore, so I'm currently looking for another brand.

Brilliant and fast working
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 July 2021Verified Purchase
After reading reviews for several products I went with this one and am so glad I did, after it arrived I looked the product up via google before using it and found very useful video instructions on their website, I purchased 2 cans and still had a bit left after treating my whole 2 bed house, it’s an older style build and some of the rooms are big.First I stripped all the beds and cushions of their covers, collecting up any clothing and blankets that had touched the floor or the cat or dog had been on, I put those in a big box in the kitchen and worked my through it all washing it at 60,Next I worked my way around the house trying to clear the floors as much as possible, wiping over non fabric items and placing them on the stripped beds and sofa, any soft toys I couldn’t wash were thoroughly hoovered before being placed on the beds.With all that done I hoovered the whole house emptying the Hoover in the outside bin before getting all the people and animals residing in our home out in the garden,Then I closed all the windows in the rooms I was spraying as instructed, put on a mask and sprayed the whole house pulling back the sofa and end table in the lounge to get underneath, making sure I did all the skirtings, spraying both under and on top of rugs, I made my way through each room so that I always finished at the door and closed the door of each room behind me when I was done, I then went outside with the rest of my family.30 minutes later as per the video instructions I popped my mask back on and nipped around the house opening every inner door and window wide, (little tip I unlocked all of my locked windows before I sprayed to reduce the amount of time I had to spend on each room while getting the windows open after the 30 mins) before going back outside, a little over an hour later (video said 60 mins but we waited until the kids wanted to come in we ventured back into the house not only did the house smelt wonderfully fresh, but ever since we’ve not seen a single flea jump from the carpet either and I was getting bitten to pieces before, two particular areas where my kitten goes I would stand and at least 6 would instantly be on my feet and my son led down and had about 4 jump on him right away, I had a tonne of bites on the bottoms of my legs and feet all of which have nearly gone now and I’ve had no new ones since the spay.Then I put the house back right, hoovered the mattresses as instructed and made the beds,Now we are half way through our 7 consecutive days hoovering the house through which is another must according to the video instructions, because while the spray will kill the hatch ones there will still be eggs in the carpet, the vibrations of vacuuming encourage them to hatch and then the spray kills them too.As well as doing all  of the above our animals are up to date on their flea treatments and we’ve been combing them through twice daily with nit combs.We got on top of the problem quickly which helps but this spray has worked amazingly and we’ve not had a single flea jump on us since using it, I was amazed at how quick and efficient it is, I highly recommend and intend to use it once a year as a preventative,Look on their website too though, it’s really informative, helps you fully understand the fleas life cycle and what you need to do to do a real thorough job and have your best chance of getting rid of them,On a side note we were also having an issue with loads of ants coming in at night, this seems to have deterred those too and we haven’t seen any of those since we’ve used it either, neither dead or alive so apparently they don’t like our house since using the spray either, win win in my eyes.

GTA. One of the best games ever made!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2013Platform: PlayStation 3Edition: Standard EditionVerified Purchase
This game is amazing. I'm not sure its exactly 5 star but its certainly closer to a 5 than a 4. Lets just say 98/100. I have played this game non stop since I received it on release day, its incredibly addictive.The characters are possibly the greatest characters of the franchise and lets be honest, we've seen a fair few of those. My favourite is probably Michael, the ex gangster who somehow ends up back in all the action again. Trevor is equally great, he seems to have a fixation with men taking off their pants but supposedly he's heterosexual. You'll certainly have fun figuring out what his game is. Franklin is possibly the most basic of the 3 characters, fitting your stereotypical gangster to a tee. He does have his own dog though, which certainly makes him unique and fun to control.You can alternate between the 3 freely majority of the time, however, there is occasions when you must control one person but this usually isn't for too long and I suppose it helps you get a feel of the characters and figure out their backgrounds a little bit. Each of the characters have their own set of contacts. It would be pretty lame if Michael didn't have his own wife's number until you started playing the game, for example. They all have the numbers of people closest to them at the start of the game but of course there are ways to add more contacts be it by doing missions or even popping to your local strip club, touching up one of the girls until she likes you enough, take her home and well.. You have a booty call.Its pretty much all here in GTA, albeit a little bit extreme at times. You can hunt, race (Not just cars but boats also), play tennis, hang out with your family, go golfing, cheat on your wife, rob convenience stores, walk and train your dog, or everyone's favourite activity, going around and just slaughtering people! There's so much variety that I have often found myself in the position where I don't know if I even want to do the missions. Its literally that large you can get hours of fun just by walking around. Buying businesses is also a possibility along with many other things. Another updated feature is the taxi missions, while only small, I feel its quite significant as you are no longer required to continuously pick up and drop off characters until you wish to quit. Its done one by one now simply by clicking L3 when inside a taxi.GTA's map is larger than all the maps I have seen in a GTA game before. It truly is enormous. I've barely left the city because its simply too big. Not that that is a bad thing.This game is everything GTA 4 should have been and more. I can almost guarantee that once you complete all the missions, you'll still never get bored of the roaming around. And that brings me to my next point..The missions are possibly the greatest missions that have ever been in a GTA game, due in part, to the fact that often, there are all 3 protagonists playable in the same mission. This shows you different things each character does during a mission. For example, (I'll use one early into the game as to not ruin it) Michael plans to rob a jewellery store but first you first have to scope out the store and find out information, then you'll have to collect (or steal) things that will help you in the robbery, then when the robbery actually takes place Franklin has to do something before Michael does his part. So basically you get to play the whole raid rather than just one characters POV. This really helps you understand the story easier because you're actually planning the whole thing out yourself.When you fail a mission you no longer have to do huge portions of the mission again as there are now checkpoints, so if you die you won't feel as daunted doing a small part of it again. This could be deemed as unfavourable however, as it does essentially make the game easier. You can also skip mission after a certain number of fails but that's entirely optional.Los Santos looks more beautiful than ever before. The graphics are truly stunning and stretch the PS3 to its limits. The game in itself plays smoothly and feels a lot more free in general. I haven't noticed many bugs. One bug I did notice was when I dived over a railing in the subway station and landed on the track but somehow seemingly fell under the world and also another bug when I attempted to skip a mission, the game simply wouldn't load. These things, particularly the second are very likely to be fixed by patches in the near future.All in all, the game is amazing and I would recommend it for any fan of the series, even if you didn't like 4 as this is truly magical and is miles ahead of it, which is what the hardcore fans want to hear as I see no logical reason why the series cannot continue. Hopefully next time we get a female protagonist (That may just be me but it would bring something totally different to GTA) as that was the only thing I was slightly disappointed about pre-release. However, I have absolutely no complaints about the game at all after playing it. Pick this up, I guarantee you won't be disappointed either!Its needless to say that this game is not for the faint-hearted, there is nudity (Both male and female), drug use, sex, violence (DUH!) and the odd torture scene. I know these are what you'd expect from a GTA game but I thought I would point it out as this time it pushes those limits further than it ever has before so be careful if you're planning on letting somebody under the age limit play it.Is the game perfect? No but its pretty damn close to perfection!

Grand Theft Auto 5 - PS3
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2013Platform: PlayStation 3Edition: Standard EditionVerified Purchase
Naturally, sites like Amazon are going to be inundated with reviews for this game over the coming weeks as gamers all over the world finally have the chance to get their teeth into Grand Theft Auto V, perhaps the most anticipated game of the last 10 years.And, you'll be happy to know, there is plenty to get your teeth into indeed. The game takes the basic idea of GTA IV and runs with it. The graphics have been neatened up, the sound is as good as ever and the movement of characters and vehicles alike remains authentic, realistic and intuitively fun to handle. The developers have also added some extras in the form of free-time activities you can do aside from the storyline. You are now invited to play tennis, do yoga or go hunting on top of GTA's old-school pastimes such as strip clubs and bowling alleys.There are also more cars than GTA IV, more clothing and accessories to customise the style of your character. You can now visit chop shops and have your vehicles upgraded, painted or customised the way you like adding things like bumpers, spray jobs, body armour or fancy hub caps. Weapons are also customisable in GTA V giving you the opportunity to develop your very own and unique arsenal of offensive weaponry.The city around you also feels more organic than that of GTA IV. There is more going on in the city of Los Santos and spontaneous side missions and interactions are more frequent, but not annoyingly so, as I said, it feels organic; part of a day in the life of Los Santos.A little note then for any of you out there who are unfamiliar with GTA. Perhaps you're considering buying it as a gift or for yourself but are unsure about ""what it's all about"". In a nutshell then: GTA is an adult game first and foremost. It is set in a fictional modern day city in the USA where players take control of three main protagonists. The storyline around these three builds the main premise of the game. GTA is however a free-roaming open-world game which means players have the opportunity to ignore the main storyline and missions and simply explore the world and what it has to offer. As I said though, it is an adult game with plenty (and I mean plenty!!) of bad language, violence, drug references/use, sexual content etc. It has an 18 rating for a very good reason!!!A quick summary then of the positives (+) and negatives (-) of GTA V:+ Beautiful graphics+ Massive open world to explore and get lost in+ Great voice acting+ Organic feel draws you into the game leaving you wanting to play and discover more+ Loads of vehicles which look beautiful and each handle differently making your choice of car very important for each mission+ 3 characters instead of 1 gives the game a unique depth and adds further integrity to the story+ Good story with interesting plot (not ground-breakingly original, but good nonetheless)- Needs 8GB of memory to run on your PS3 - This is fine if you have the space, but be warned if you have an older 16GB model for example- Melee combat (fists, bats etc.) still feels a little clunky and unresponsive discouraging the player from using it- Silly driver AI (this isn't a massive problem, nor does it stand out, but once or twice it has irritated me when I'm bombing down the road at 150mph and some stupid bus driver pulls out in front of me)Overall, GTA V is everything that I had hoped it would be and more. All my other games will be gathering dust on the shelf during the next few weeks as I really get to grips with all of GTA V's secrets and wonders. I urge anyone to buy this who wants a fun, interactive and very addictive shooter/driver/movie-style RPG game, but would deter anyone who is easily offended, dislikes the mention of drugs, racial and societal stereotypes and/or crime in general.Thanks for reading and enjoy GTA V!

Famous strong jamaican rum, I love the flavour.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2024Size Name: 70 clVerified Purchase
I love wray and nephew,  a lot of reviews seem to focus on its strength alone but I find it delicious. Whilst it will certainly get you drunk, the flavour isnt bad at all, its just very different from what people know as 'white rum', dividing rum into white vs dark isnt really a meaningful way to categorise it, a lighter colour normally just indicates its not aged but tells you nothing about how it was made. Jamaican over-proof rums like this tend to have a very distinct 'funky' flavour because of how theyre made, some people describe this as kind of like bananas/tropical fruits and dark or even burtn sugar, some people get a slightly petrol like smell. So if you enjoy rum give this a try, you may find it vile, plenty of people do, but I for one think its great and far more interesting than smoother rums. It goes well with anything citrus and a little sugar.

I’m heavily into decent audio whether that’s ear buds, speaker, headphones.The sound quality is outstanding, nice amount of bass and the app provided for different option in terms of sound as well as customising.Talk through is excellent so you don’t have to take them out to have a conversation. Yes it feels a bit odd at first but once you’re confident you are shouting you can chat easily. You can change the sitting to whether turn this off (I found it activates if I cough which is ideal if I know I’m somewhere I won’t be talking) or you can change the amount of time is stays active.Noise cancellation is very good! Remember these are ear buds, they will never match over ear headphones (I recommend the over ear versions of these whether you go hard on the M5’s or get a great deal on the M3’s - I have the latter and they remain my favourite to block the world out and disappear into great sounding music!)They do however turn the volume right down on chatter around you. I bought these for the office where there can be upwards of 8 people talking together or on the phone - we do have someone who lacks awareness of their own volume but these buds heavily reduce this noise.You may heard a bit when the music goes quite or in between tracks but even on the Bose Quiet Comfort 2 they do do this. So go at these knowing you’ll hear a little something and you’ll be right.The buds themselves are big. I have small ears (I’m female) and they fit and feel great. I thought they’d feel heavy or cumbersome but they didn’t. I’ve considered the new M5’s but as I don’t have problem I don’t need that solution (albeit if just LOVE to have them because they are going to be great!)You get three sizes of tips. I wear two different sizes having one ear canal a bit bigger.You just make sure you twist them in (gently, no need to ram them!) to get them to ‘lock’ and that will support comfort and noise cancellation.The holder keeps the buds charged, it’s nice and small, so would fit in your jeans pocket for example, and not look like you have something extremely bulky in there. I like that the ear buds grab magnetically into the case and also when you close it it has that reassuring magnetic snap. There is a light on the case to show you the charging level as well. This can also be viewed within the app.In terms of the app, this is brilliant and stable, as is the connection between my iPhone and the ear buds. The app offers everything you would expect in terms of information regarding the charge of the buds and the case as well as the ability to change from noise cancelling to ambient sound or two neither of these.In summary, Sony know exactly what they are doing and whether you go for the M4 or another version such as the M5. I have no doubt you will not be disappointed.

Great ANC. Great sound quality.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 June 2023Colour Name: BlackStyle Name: WF-1000XM4Pattern Name: SingleVerified Purchase
I purchased these primarily for the noise cancelling as I have sensory processing issues and I'm especially sensitive to sounds. I previously had a pair of over ear headphones and wanted something that looks a lot more discreet and doesn't make me look like Warren from 'There's Something About Mary'.I was a little unsure whether these would stay in my ears as the buds themselves are fairly large but once they're in my ears they stay in place and they look the right size. I find them to be comfortable and I can wear these in a public space and it looks perfectly normal to have them in.The noise cancelling is excellent. Ticking clocks, the sound of the dishwasher, talking, buzzing lightbulbs and humming TVs... All filtered out. Wearing these as a passenger in the car means the sound of motorbikes and loud exhausts are reduced considerably too. Some sharp, sudden noises manage to get through but they are dulled.I've tried the 'speak to talk' setting that detects when you speak and allows you to hear your own voice but it's a bit irritating. If someone wants to engage in conversation with me I keep them on the ambient setting and adjust the pass through to a level that that I'm comfortable with.I've set my phone to stream to my headphones in LDAC which is Sony's codec for streaming in high quality. The setting is only available on my old Samsung S10 plus if I activate developer mode and then go into a developer menu that allows you to switch LDAC on. There are plenty of videos on YouTube that show you how to do it, but it's definitely worth doing. The bass is powerful, clear and thumping and the treble sounds balanced with rich midtones and vocals.I purchased these on offer. They've been sat in my wishlist for a while but I think the newer version of these will be out shortly so the price is gradually coming down on these ones. For me, these are perfect and great value for money as they give me a bit more comfort in noisy places or I can go into my own world, listening to music I like. Highly recommended.

Just like the one I had as a child! Minus the C Cell Batteries! *Recommended*
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2023Verified Purchase
I had one of these when I was around 6 years old and it helped my spelling immeasurably. Years later I would be diagnosed as having Dyslexia (as an adult) and the assessor believed that my time with the Speak & Spell was what made it so hard for my learning challenge to be discovered. Essentially, I had gotten used to seeing the words as an image, which is why I can spell well, despite having some issues reading from certain fonts and page colours. I brought this for my 6 year old granddaughters who adore it and have barely put it down since they got one for Christmas. To see the joy on their faces as they play with the Speak & Spell (even with the authentic American accent and spelling quirks), takes me right back to a happier time in my early youth. It makes their enjoyment of it feel so validating and is a testament to the effectiveness of the product and its design. Kids everywhere have way more advanced screens and sound on the most common of devices, but there is something to be said for the benefit of nostalgia, intertwined with shared child hood experiences that have 40 years between them. Couldn’t recommend enough.

American accent
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2024Verified Purchase
Bought this gadget for my 8 yr old,  we live in the UK. The voice can be difficult to understand due to the American accent, for example calf and cafe sound almost the same. The clarity of the word sometimes sounds muffled. I had this toy back in the 70s and it's not the same as I remember it be.

I bought this for Christmas for my disabled uncle, he has learning difficulties and is the eternal 7 year old. He always had a Speak and Spell when they were originally on sale, it really did help him to learn, he would play on it for hours (along with the speak & math) so when I saw they'd rereleased the Speak & Spell I just had to get him one, he loves it!

Its good but...
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 August 2023Verified Purchase
I recently purchased the Speak & Spell Electronic Game, and overall, I think it's a good educational tool for children to learn spelling. The interface is user-friendly, and my child enjoys using it to practice spelling words.The game's simplicity makes it easy for kids to understand and engage with, which is a big plus. It has helped my child improve their spelling skills and gain confidence in their abilities.However, one major drawback is the very limited word database. While the existing words are helpful, it would have been much better if the device had a wider range of words to learn from. After a while, my child started to feel like they were repeating the same words, which can become monotonous and less challenging.I believe the Speak & Spell could be greatly enhanced if there was a way to input custom words or expand the word database through updates. This would allow parents and teachers to tailor the learning experience to match the child's level and progress.In conclusion, I still think the Speak & Spell is a great idea and a valuable tool for learning spelling. However, to make the most of it, it would be beneficial to supplement it with books or other resources that offer a broader selection of words. With a few improvements, this electronic game could become even more effective and versatile in helping children develop their spelling abilities. Therefore, I would rate it 3 out of 5 stars.

Takes a while for results to show but you need to be patient.I've been using everyday (only once a day not twice) since December 6th and my hair is thicker and with more density especially on the sides at the front of my hair. My hair hasn't been this thick since i was younger.It will definitely work for you if you're just starting to see your hair getting thinner/you're losing hair and could potentially without intervention go bald.I was probably on the Norwood scale a 2.5 going towards 3 when i started using this.Highly recommended.

Whether it works depends on the cause of your hair loss
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2021Verified Purchase
I'm a woman in my late 30s who's been losing hair due to a combination of stress, PCOS, and malabsorption for over a decade. It wasn't until the last year or so that I realised my hairline was severely receding. My temples were completely bare and my front hair line had been pushed back significantly, making my already large forehead look even bigger. I'm not a particularly vain person, but I was distressed. I was used to having bald patches on the back of my head that were covered by my waist length hair, but losing hair around my face was new.I looked into the various hair loss treatments, deciding the medication from the doctor had far too many side effects, and the shampoo didn't have nearly enough evidence that it actually worked, and so settled on the over the counter foam. If it didn't work then I'd only wasted 40 quid, and if it did, I could easily justify the price going forwards. It's no more than a coffee a week, if that. Incredibly, the ""for women"" version is twice the price for half the product, despite having identical ingredients now that they offer the same percentage of minoxidil. They suggest that men use the product twice a day, and women once, so I bought the ""for men"" for a much better deal and applied it once a day.When they say you'll lose hair when you start treatment, they mean it. But it is hair that you would have lost anyway, as part of the natural hair growth cycle, you're just losing it sooner. All of the hairs that I lost were very thin and weak compared to the rest still in my head. I didn't lose any thick hairs, or chunks, or start balding where I'd applied the product (on my temples and across the front of my hair line, where my hair loss was showing, even though there were many claims that this specific placement wouldn't work). I didn't have any topical reaction to the foam at all, except maybe some slight itching, but that could have been my imagination or even just the summer heat. I just lost the weak hairs that were going to fall out anyway, all at once, over the course of a couple of days. And then nothing.Within about a week of use, I could feel fluff on the previously completely smooth areas I'd been applying the product. Once nightly, although I definitely missed a few days here and there over the longer term. The foam itself dissolves quite quickly on the hand and I was finding it difficult to get it onto my head before it turned to liquid, which then ran down my face, so I started spraying it directly onto my head at one temple and spreading it across the top of my forehead to the other temple before rubbing it all in. Very sloppy, highly unattractive, but it worked for me. I made sure to massage the foam/liquid in to my problem areas until it had been absorbed, just like a moisturiser. Any that dripped down my face just got wiped up as I was washing my hands afterwards. It wasn't a big deal or difficult in any way. I managed to get my hair pretty damp when I was first figuring it out, but it dried down quickly and didn't leave any residue or need washing again or anything. I pretty much halved the amount they suggested using so that it stopped running down my face and didn't see any negative impact.Maybe a month after starting, I was losing one or two hairs every few days. Nothing at all compared to the brush full I'd have to pull off after brushing, or the massive amounts that would actually block the drain when I washed it. I switched to a Tangle Teezer as they're supposed to be more gentle, and carried on my haphazard application every day (or so) until last month, which was the 3 month mark. At this point I hadn't even finished the first of 3 bottles. That happened at 4 months, a few days ago.My hair has always grown fast, but I now have 3-ish inches of brand new growth around both temples and along my front hair line. I look like I'm growing in a rather pathetic fringe. There are still areas on my temples that haven't taken to the treatment and the hair is definitely not as dense as the rest of my head, but given the placement and the fact that I'm fair anyway, I feel like this is normal. I'm now applying the foam once every 3 or 4 days just to maintain what's there and have been doing this for a month so far without any hair loss as a result, although I'd not like to try and go without and have to start again. I've read a lot of people say that their growth started falling out within a week of stopping and complete loss occurred within a couple of months. Just the stuff they grew because of the foam, not their whole heads, this will not make you bald if you're not bald to start with. I've also noticed thickening on my head in areas where I haven't applied the foam, like at the back of my head where I do have thinning and patches but it can't be seen unless my hair is tied up tightly, and along my parting. I assume this is because the drug has entered my blood stream, but I haven't noticed growth anywhere else on my body increasing at all.I wouldn't say I'm a changed woman or that my hair loss has been completely reversed, but there is a very obvious and significant difference in pictures from July and November that I can only attribute to using this product. I had no expectations going in, but knew that if it did work, I'd need to keep using it. I don't see it as any different to taking a prescription medication, except instead of stopping a heart attack or diabetic attack, this stops hair loss. I still have 2 bottles left, and at the rate I go through it, they should last me until this time next year.I'd definitely give it a try if you're curious. A taxi home after a night out will cost you more, and you might end up surprised by the results. And if it doesn't work, there are options from your GP or even transplants if it comes to that. It's not going to work for everyone, but that's normal as we aren't all losing hair for the same reason.

Does it work? (12 Month Review)
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 May 2019Verified Purchase
(full 12 month review)I’m 18 and was stuffing hereditary hair loss on my hairline (mostly on the temples) and after trying a number of different things to try and stimulate hair growth I was having no luck, so decided to turn to Regaine as a last resort and it’s the best decision I made.  Like it says twice a day use, and it takes 8 - 10 weeks before you notice any improvement so it’s about being patient, but worth it for the outcome. I would recommend regain for anyone that’s balding or thinning or has really fine hair. Pictures are before and after taken at 7 weeks into using Regain FoamUpdating my review to show you the outcome after 4 months. It’s a slow process but gradually does work at regrowing hair as you can see in the new photos uploaded.8 month update: very slow process but still shows signs of progress since starting the product- will keep uploading pictures throughout my year long trial for those looking to start this product.This is my 10 month update of using Regaine Foam, results are slow but promising, I use this as often as 3/4 times a day, although this is a timely process the main aim is patience as is takes around 12 - 18 months to fully restore to full and thick new hairs. To help amplify your hair growth results you could also use caffine and biotin shampoos alongside regaine, I find a shampoo branded “grow me” is effective as it has DHT blockers which is the main cause of baldness, it helps keep blood flow to your scalp, you could also turn to Biotin tablets, this isn’t harmful as it’s simply a vitamin.12 month update - I’ve been using regain for a whole year and the results aren’t as good as I was hoping, hair growth has improved but not by much, use at your discretion.

Upgraded from XS Max to the 14 Pro Max. The build quality, higher refresh rate and slightly bigger screen, noticeably faster processor, Dynamic Island and especially the cameras make this a big upgrade for me. 10/10 would recommend.The only thing I could see being another improvement from this would be adopting USB-C. But as the 15 Pro Max is significantly more expensive as of this writing, this is an OK compromise.I bought this from a top vendor and in ""Excellent"" condition. It arrived as new, out of the box but everything works and 100% battery health. I could not be happier.

Phone came well packaged up with protective film and bubble wrap in a solid box - also in box was a power cable and a wee tool for removing sims. The phone itself was scratch free and in great overall condition, wee bit dusty around the camera lens, but nothing of any  concern. I transferred my data from my old “11 pro max” with no problem at all. Battery charged to 100% and the facial recognition is so much quicker than on my old phone. Am delighted. Hope performance lives up to first appearances.  I had always planned to get this phone for Christmas, and was not impressed when Apple discontinued it. This is the second time I have purchased a refurbished iPhone (last one was an 11 pro max from CEX, which has been amazing). Hoping this one performs as well as it was great value for money compared to buying the comparable 15 model.

Great phone from UR.co.uk
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 October 2023Size Name: 128GBColour: Space BlackVerified Purchase
So I paid around £869 for this you could get it for £830 for the 128gb as of the end of September because the sellers were shaking the prices. The phone has 1000% health and 50 cycles on it. There are few scratches on the buttons but none on the screen or the sides. There is visible dust in the speaker  vents on the top of the screen but it doesn’t bother me that much. The touch responsiveness feels slightly off for now but luckily Amazon has a a long replacement or refund policy so I feel safe. Overall it’s a great phone for the price and feels quite similar to the 15Pro max for a huge discount. The phone was in immaculate condition and the slight scratches that I mentioned are verrrryyyy slight so it’s not noticeable at all if you manage to get this for £800 ish it’s a stealEdit: I have been using this for 3 weeks and it feels great I have added a spigen screen guard and case to keep this in mint condition but the touch randomly feels non responsive( I have moved from an android device so maybe I’m not used to iOS) will post an update in 6 months

            So I paid around £869 for this you could get it for £830 for the 128gb as of the end of September because the sellers were shaking the prices. The phone has 1000% health and 50 cycles on it. There are few scratches on the buttons but none on the screen or the sides. There is visible dust in the speaker  vents on the top of the screen but it doesn’t bother me that much. The touch responsiveness feels slightly off for now but luckily Amazon has a a long replacement or refund policy so I feel safe. Overall it’s a great phone for the price and feels quite similar to the 15Pro max for a huge discount. The phone was in immaculate condition and the slight scratches that I mentioned are verrrryyyy slight so it’s not noticeable at all if you manage to get this for £800 ish it’s a stealEdit: I have been using this for 3 weeks and it feels great I have added a spigen screen guard and case to keep this in mint condition but the touch randomly feels non responsive( I have moved from an android device so maybe I’m not used to iOS) will post an update in 6 months

1 Month setup and usage review.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2021Verified Purchase
Purchase was made late November. Item was received quickly through Prime membership.Item is presented in a nice box, that is strong and durable, not you usual flimsy type. Inside you get the actual Cronus Zen, 3 usb cables.(1) short cable for flashing firmware and then connection to device your going to be using it on. Connects to back of Zen(2) Programming cable that is used to connect to a computer to load the actual scripts to the unit. Connects to right side of Zen.(3) long micro usb cable to use in wire mode on controller, or for duping a controller when using another. Connects to left side of Zen. Or front left depending on what configuration your running.Front ports are for mouse&keyboard or wire controller.Flashing firmware is easy, load firmware update program from website and connect to pc via short cable attached to back of Zen and press small button on bottom of Zen to put it in bootloader status and flash.Programming is straight forward, plug into right side of Zen and connect to pc and run the Zen programming software found on the website.You can select a Zen made script or one of the main fan based scripts. Loading each one into the 8 available slots. Then write them to the unit.Switch between each profile by pressing the right blue button.Changing the scripts to suit your needs on the fly is straight forward press left trigger and select, this opens the script up and then you can scroll through what's editable. You need to check each scripts docentaion as each is different.I run this on an Xbox one X, I have used this with a standard wireless joypad and have also used it on a wired joypad. Both work with no issues.I borrowed a series 2 elite controller and have successfully paired and used this. Note** I was unable to get the series 2 Elite controller to work in the Xbox Elite controller app wireless I had to put the usb in the left port of the zen and connect it to joypad. This only needs to be done when you want to map buttons. Once mapped and uploaded, I unplugged the joypad and used it wireless and the joypad worked with the Settings I had programmed it with.As my joypads are wireless I have a Xbox wireless adapter plugged into the front left.I also use a wireless Astro headset so don't use the 3.5mm port in joypad.So, Am I happy with the unit YES. It does need a pc to program it but once done it's flawless, the scripts are free, so don't ever BUY any the ones that are fan based are free and work really well.Installation overall was easy little head scratching at one point but power cycling Xbox to restart fixed the issue.Would I recommend this YES already have and two friends have purchased.It is worth the money YES, for the fact you can use mouse and keyboard and that it gives you some nice perks depending on the scripts. I originally purchased it for mouse and keyboard, being a PC gamer, but been out of the loop for some time. So use to using a joypad I have stuck with this. Muscle memory.There is alot of YouTube video available to set the unit up on Xbox, Pc, PlayStation.Playing with a PlayStation pad on an Xbox and vice versa, or playing with either console pads on a pc.And installing scripts and modifying them on the fly.I am looking at getting a strike pack for my Xbox controller, so will update this review with my findings.Hope this helps...

Useless! Promises a lot, gives nothing!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 September 2022Verified Purchase
This review is from a PC user, I have not tested this with consoles.Pros:It looks niceCons:It literally does not do a single thing that it's meant to do!I'm a Call of Duty player. I use keyboard and mouse and I play on PC. I have kit that's compatible with this device and I've spent many hours trying to get it to work.My background - I used to be a programmer / developer in a previous career. I am very computer literate and I've yet to meet a device I can't get working. Until today!The device registers fine with my PC. I can download a game profile and I can connect peripherals to it - XBox one controller, gaming mouse, keyboard etc. But that's where the success ends.The device completely ignores most of my key presses in game (I've mapped and remapped them several times). It causes lag with my input, so I'm actually worse of with this device than without it. And no matter what features I select in my game pack, I still have recoil and I don't have the aim assist! So, it's an expensive paperweight that makes you worse at gaming and doesn't do as advertised. I cannot return this thing fast enough! It's useless.I've followed the manufacturers instructions. I've watched their Youtube channel. I've watched other people's Youtube channel. I've spent many hours doing the same thing over and over to try and get this to work thinking perhaps I was doing something wrong - but I'm not as I've done exactly as others have.This device, for PC gamers, is pointless and best avoided! Don't waste your cash.

I set my expectations too high
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 February 2022Verified Purchase
This might work well if you're not on PC. I purchased this just so I could basically get a lock on for some of my games such as Fortnite and gta on PC. But as I am on PC and I am not used to playing with a controller I had to setup all my keybinds on my keyboard. This was time consuming and annoying as muscle memory is required ( when I see the ""X"" button I have to press the Spacebar as the X button is binded to the jump function as default). The Cronus itself gave a multitude of errors which could be fixed easily thanks to their user friendly website. I feel if you're a console player and you're used to be ""handicapped"" this device would ease your life. Maybe I didn't use the right gamepack or script as I just used the scripts present in Zen studio. I just feel my aim and recoil control is good enough to not require this device and a small lock on feel isn't justified for the overall controller output and laggy feel in all the games. In conclusion I thought I'd become a makeshift shroud after buying this device but setting my expectations too high lead to a massive disappointment.

Amazing result with this product
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2024Verified Purchase
The grout between the tiles in my shower was completely black and disgusting in some areas, despite regular cleaning and numerous attempts to remove it with various products. Previous attempts occasionally resulted in some improvement, but nothing as good as this. Even though I read a lot of good reviews before purchasing, I must admit I thought it probably wouldn’t make a huge difference. I was totally wrong. I sprayed it on and left it for about half an hour. When I went to rinse it off, I was surprised to find that the black mould had almost completely gone and my shower looked as good as new! There are a few tiny stubborn spots that could do with a repeat treatment, but other than that the grout is as white as when it was new.  The only thing I would say is that the smell is extremely strong and bleachy and it gave me a slight headache. Despite that, I would not hesitate to buy it again as the results are fantastic.

Excellent black mold treatment
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2024Verified Purchase
Really effective treatment for the dreaded black mold that appears this time of year. The foam spray works really well on vertical surfaces as it doesn't run down the wall as quickly as the non foam. Although the manufacturers say on the bottle that this isn't recommended for ceilings, I used this on my bedroom ceiling, which has a textured finish, by applying the foam to a j cloth and then dabbing it on the affected areas. After 30 minutes I rinsed off with water on a cloth. There were only a couple of areas where I needed to reapply and work in with a small brush. Rinsed off and so far, no black has reappeared. This foam does contain bleach so I covered everything with a painting sheet first. The only thing that got bleaceg was the cloth I used. This does have a residual smell but it cleared after a few hours with the windows open. The smell is way less pungent than the non foam version of this treatment though. Highly recommended.

It removes mold as fast as in a couple of minutes but the smell of chlorine is as bad as it gets. I only sprayed a couple of times and my whole room is full of chlorine. I will say don't buy this if you can't open your window a lot or your window is small. Only do this if you have somewhere else to go for a day. An en-suite room with a small window and one exit won't do it.

Awesome for mould in all areas
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2024Verified Purchase
This stuff is the dogs wotnots for killing mould spores growing in your house. Cold corners, bathrooms and showers etc.Like a lot of houses we have high humidity in our house (kids not closing door when showering) and in cold corners with little air circulation we get mould patches, so need something to treat it every 6 months or soI have used the non-foam version not knowing this was available, and it tends to get rid of most of the mould, but this works just a bit better; you spray it on a wall and it hangs a bit better where its been sprayed so seems to eradicate more mould.In terms of the spray itself, wear gloves; this is pretty nasty stuff and smells very toxic indeed... it made me cough a few times. I would recommend spraying first thing in morning, ventilating the room and keeping the door closed so it doesnt get breathed in.Spray it on, wipe excess off immediately then leave for few hours.Wash it all off properly.Repeat again.I sprayed this behind my bath taps where some moudl that I couldnt get to with a brush was appearing and within a few hours it was spotless white. I also sprayed it on some stubborn mould growing in the shower sealant and it was gone after 2 applications. Saved me resealing the shower as I tend to have to every 12-18 months.I also pre-emptively sprayed it on a corner of one of the bedrooms... then wiped it to thin it out a bit and left it for a day to dry and for the smell to go... mainly as an active barrier there and so far its kept that corner mould free. It did however eat into the (waterproof) yellow paint on our walls revealing the white undercoat so just take care on bright decor. This is strong stuff.

Very effective mould remover
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 March 2024Verified Purchase
We had a huge black mould on the bathroom ceiling in our new house. We sprayed this foam and let work over the night. In the morning the ceiling was white as if it was painted. I liked that there was no need of scratching or brushing. It just worked by itself. It’s very strong chemical so we had that bleach smell for 48 hours but it’s worth it to get rid of the harmful mould. The foam was dripping a tiny bit from the ceiling but we removed the carpet and it didn’t do any harm to anything else. Its been a month since we used and ceiling is still perfect white. I definitely recommend this product and will use in future again if the mould returns.

Great buds
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 March 2024Verified Purchase
I have tried all manner of earbuds and I have to say that I didn't expect these to be as good as they are. I used silicone earplugs religiously but it got to the point where they really started hurting my ears. The sound wouldn't be completely blocked anyway as they'd start to harden and lossen off from your ear. These however, feel like your ears are blocked, but in a very comfortable way? I am on my second pair as I somehow lost one bud during the night and have been unable to find it since, so make sure these are put in as securely as possible, so you can feel a little suction as you place them in. Great help for sleeping but also for blocking out excessive noise during the day or night, which becomes even more prudent if suffering with a headache!

Fantastic for travelling and room sharing
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 March 2024Verified Purchase
I bought these for my mother some time ago and chose to buy myself a pair after hearing her praise for them. My intention was to use them on the plane and once at the hotel due to room sharing. They were fantastic for limiting the engine noise (and the kids) of the plane and allowed me to have consistent sleep whilst sharing a room with someone who spent the night coughing and snoring. They are extremely comfortable though I would recommend taking the time to find the right fit with the options that come with the product, I also recommend wetting the buds before placing them in your ears as I found they sit more comfortably this way. The small case for them is fantastic and rather durable. I will be using these for my masters degree study sessions!

Review for ASD/SPD users
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 July 2021Verified Purchase
After a lot of research I decided to buy these to see if they would help with daily sounds and noises that annoy me.Pros:• Once you get them in the right position in your ears, you can’t feel them and they don’t hurt.• The actual design of the loop that sits outside in your ear means I personally didn’t obsess about not being able to get them out easily/getting stuck etc.• They’re fairly subtle in your ears in comparison to other in-ear ear plugs or large noise cancelling headphones• Definitely work to smother background noises, it doesn’t get rid of them completely , I could still hear traffic or a child shouting and screaming etc outside but it wasn’t as harsh and annoyed me a lot less• Comes with a little case you can put them in when you need to take them outCons:• They’re not the cheapest out there• If they’re not in your ear properly, they can be annoying and uncomfortable• I personally can’t eat with them in• They cancel noise almost too well at short range so I had to take them out to be able to concentrate on a conversation properly. I could still hear what was being said, but trying to focus on the one voice you’re trying to listen to while everything else is so muffled is difficultOverall for just sitting in the house watching tv etc on my own, I really like them and they work for me. If I’m trying to have a conversation with someone, I can’t hear the volume of my own voice and struggle to hold the conversation with them in. I plan on buying the Loop Experience ear plugs to see if they make having conversations easier but still muffle enough background noise.This is my opinion as someone on the Autism spectrum using them for sensory issues and I’m writing this to try and help those like me that came looking for the same thing but couldn’t find much useful information for specifically Autism use.

They don’t block sound, they do divert your attention.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2024Colour Name: Quiet SapphireVerified Purchase
First, they don’t block sound. I can still hear everything around me. Wearing a pair of snug in-ear earphones switched off would have the same effect.However, there is something performatively useful as a ceremony about putting something in your ear as a block against the world (because you’re settling yourself up to be tranquil) and I suppose it would be useful that other people would be able to see them and know you’re trying to dial down.The longer you wear them the more your brain disconnects from the background noise. It’s like you’re diverting your attention. That’s their secret.They are very comfortable and they do have four different sizes of earbud tip.They aren’t like good noise cancelling headphones that do block noise. If you notice a noise (eg a cough or a passing van) then you’re back in the room.I wanted them to dampen the near-distant sound of the traffic as I try to read and think while working at home but without having to have music on. What they do is to immerse you in a world with the noise dialled down a little. I can still hear the traffic but the sound of my tinnitus and the noises of my own breathing and saliva, etc are elevated. My brain is diverted from the bad outside noises to inside-head noises. If you’re doing something (working, cooking, gardening) then you may realise after a while that you haven’t noticed much noise until something called you back (your phone, a passing van). You can hear all the nearby noises (typing, somebody talking to you, chopping veg).So, I think they’re useful to divert your attention away from bothersome external noise but I really do question whether they’re worth the money.

Effective and comfortable ear plugs
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2024Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Easy to insert and comfortable to wear. I find these much more effective than foam types. Easy to sleep with. They sit fully in the ear so don’t make noises against the pillow. Easy to remove, but do so gently as the suction can cause discomfort if removed quickly.Several sizes of the actual “cones “ are provided, so should suit most adults.Nice sturdy case.We’ll worth the money, in my view.

Best game ever made even better.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2022Style Name: SingleVerified Purchase
One of the best games ever made has been made even better.A lot of people seem to be complaining about this re-release, which some points I can understand like the price being too high for a remake of a decade old game. I however had no problem paying that price as this is one of the best games ever made and anyone who has played the original on PS3 or remaster on PS4 would understand.There have been many improvements in this remake, the main one obviously being the graphics. This is probably the best looking game out there right now, better than The last of us part 2 (tlou2) and horizon forbidden west. The facial animations are much better allowing for a much more impressive and emotional experience than the original.The gameplay also flows a lot better than the original thanks to the new AI taken from TLOU2. While there haven't been any new gameplay additions, the gameplay is just generally better than the original because of the new animations and AI. The haptic feedback is also pretty good, you can feel each movement but the use of triggers is not the best I have seen. Sometimes the triggers will just not work or the resistance is too minor to even make a difference, hopefully this is something that can be updated in a patch.I have seen complaints from people that they did not add the prone or dodge mechanics from TLOU2 which I think are pretty silly complaints. Joel is a 50 year old man while ellie is about 20 in TLOU2. How do people expect someone of Joel's age to be going prone and dodging attacks like he's some sort of ninja?I initially left this review when I still had an older 4K monitor that did not support HDR and was only 60hz. I have since gotten an OLED and replayed this remake again, it looks even better, its absolutely phenomenal. The HDR implementation is probably the best I have ever seen, it truly makes the experience completely different and makes the game look even more realistic. This game also has VRR support and runs at a consistent 70-80fps in the performance mode (1440p upscaled to 4K), even 90fps in some cutscenes which is really impressive for a game with such good graphics and fidelity, making the whole experience even better. The quality mode runs at a native 4K at 30fps with slightly better textures than performance mode but its not enough of a difference to cut your frame rate in half, and if you have a TV with VRR, it will run at 40fps in the quality mode.While this remake wasn't necessarily necessary as the original still holds up somewhat well today. This remake is great, especially for people who have never played the original and want to get into the series and experience some of the best storytelling is gaming and dont want to have to deal with the outdated graphics and mechanics of the original.Overall, a great remake that I highly recommend for new or existing fans of The Last of us.

Exactly as expected, the same game, but at it's best.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 September 2022Style Name: SingleVerified Purchase
Product-wise, it showed up on time and in perfect condition for a better price than most others selling it. Now to talk about the game.It's the same beloved game, rebuilt on their new engine tech (yes rebuilt, it doesn't take a genius to see this isn't just a simple port job). Just as advertised. It admittedly feels a shame that we didn't get the dodge mechanic from part 2 but it certainly doesn't ruin the experience. This project feels anything but lazy. It's stunning, one of the most stunning games I've ever played, perhaps THE most. It's a remarkable story that stuck with me since I first played the original 7-8 years ago, and the new gunplay and feeling of the gameplay is top-notch. Everything is so fluid and feels really grounded and gritty, it's so much fun. The level of care and attention put into every corner of this game is stunning. And I'd recommend playing with a decent pair of headphones. I underestimated how cool the 3D audio tech would be, it really shines here.If you played the PS4 version and were satisfied and aren't much of a replayer, it isn't gonna be worth the price tag for you. If you played it and do really like replaying your favorites, like me, I doubt you'd be disappointed. There's plenty of replay value and they've taken advantage of all the new stuff on offer for PS5. It's also worth it if you have some disabilities that prevented you playing on PS4, because the new accessibility stuff is amazing.Essentially, it's a game for everyone who thinks the price is worth the product. A little bit like...every game ever.It doubles up as an attention magnet because anything with Last Of Us on it summons controversy, so there's some more value added :)

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2023Style Name: SingleVerified Purchase
The Last of Us 1 when it was originally released in 2013 was a show stopper. It changed the way games were perceived and showed how games were meant to be made. It's downside was the capabilities of the technology at the time.Jump forward to 2014 when The Last of Remastered was released on PS4 and it showed how the game was meant to look, but that's all it was just a graphical overhall.Now 8 years later we get a remake using modern technology which blows the originals out of the water. It truly blew my mind seeing a destroyed Boston in 4K HDR and to see the character models and their facial expression in clear 4K was incredible.It keeps its difficulty level and it's replayability, but takes alot of mechanics from The Last of Us Part 2 which made it officially The Best Game Ever Made and utilized it well, so for those used to Part 2 are able to just pick up the controller and play.Speaking of whith the use of the haptics in the controller really create a real sense of urgency and fear as you can feel the footsteps and the strain of the triggers as you fire your gun is really fear inducing. Coupled with the 3D audio, I will never get used to hearing the sounds of the Clickers all around me.Highly recommended!

Choosing an Android / mobile gaming controller?  Read this.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 July 2020Platform For Display: PlayStation 4Edition: BlackVerified Purchase
I never knew it would be so hard to find a suitable controller for mobile gaming ... and I've now messed around buying and returning a few controllers, so I thought I'd write a review to hopefully save others the trouble i've been through.Games played for review: F1 Mobile Racing (Codemasters) and Call of Duty Mobile (TiMi Studios / Tencent Games).  Connection: Bluetooth.Controller #1 - Steel Series Stratos Duo. Price paid: £64.99 not including phone mount.It looked the business, and with gaming sites recommending it, I bought it straight away and was initially not disapointed. Battery is built in, the look and feel is excellent and it holds comfortably like an X-Box controller. When not in use it goes to sleep by itself to preserve battery. The only slight disapointment was the Steel Series phone mount prevents you from plugging a USB lead in whilst it's attached - meaning you have to faff around removing it when it's time to re-charge.  But, the recharge wasn't needed often - battery life was good, and the LED's tell you how much remains. Other reviews have complained that the 4 LED's flash every few seconds when connected to Bluetooth - it didn't bother me.However, I really struggled with controlling my car in F1 Mobile Racing.  The steering seemed delayed and digital, applying counter steer was impossible. I started to look for other controllers which might perform better, and I also consider that the game itself is at fault here - the game doesn't officially support controllers on Android, and this shows. Also, be aware that this controller is not supported at all by Call of Duty.Quality appears to be Steel Series achilles heal, and after just two or three weeks of gaming, the ""B"" button stopped working properly, causing the controller to lock-up when this is pressed. If it wasn't for this fault, I'd probably have kept this controller and been reasonably happy, even without being able to play Call of Duty.Pro's:Materials quality, finishBatteryComfortable to holdSleep works wellCon's:It brokePhone mount is fiddlyNot all games support itController #2 - Jevogh Xbox one Controller JV24.  Price paid: £45.00.Note:  I didn't try this controller with Call of Duty.Whilst trying to work out why my Formula One car was so uncontrollable, I bought this significantly cheaper controller to do a comparison. It worked just as badly for controlling the car, and wasn't a very nice controller and I quickly returned it.Controller #3 - Sony Playstation Dualshock 4. Price paid: £44.99By this time I had tried Call of Duty and seen the error of my ways...  I don't have a Playstation these days and didn't realise the controllers are Bluetooth compatible, and work with Android.  Suddenly my F1 car is more controllable, and my laptimes have improved - it's hard to pinpoint the exact difference (analogue stick deadzone, perhaps?), and F1 Mobile Racing is still not perfect, but it's a lot better.I've had a few connection issues, and I'm also unsure of the state of charge of the controller battery... Without having a Playstation to tell me this, I have no indication and I suppose it could run out of battery mid-game. Worse, it doesn't seem to go to sleep, so you have to turn off your phones bluetooth unless you want the battery to drain. You also have to avoid certain USB fast chargers if you wan't to avoid killing the battery. Furthermore, I've had some Bluetooth connectivity issues - I had to re-start my phone, and re-pair the connection to get it working again. Although I think this is potentially teething issues whilst I get used to how it pairs.Finally, the first phone mount I bought snapped literally within hours... It seems Sony have designed a controller that is inherantly difficult to mount a phone onto (because of the touch-pad front button), and the plastic mounts have to curve around this button, with a thin plastic section. So, be prepared for breakages of this part.Pro'sSupported by more Android gamesController quality is very highCon'sNot as comfortable to holdNo indication of battery charge levelBluetooth connection unreliableDon't use a fast-chargerPhone mounts are fragileIn conclusion, I thought this would be really simple;  buy a controller, have more fun on games.  But it's turned into a saga of buying and returning hardware to find something suitable for purpose, and even now the Sony PS4 controller is not perfect for the job.

I ordered a PS4 controller described as “Used - Very Good”. When unpacked it was clear the item was damaged. The controller had been glued back together, there were gaps at the plastic joins, and when turned on and used the power connector was intermittent and the up button was stuck leading to the control on the screen always going up. Seller states that the damage happened in transit but this was clearly like it before shopping! I very much doubt someone gluing it back together while on shipping! Utterly disappointed in the product and service.

The Echo Show 5 is a compact but powerful machine, combining the convenience of a smart display with the functionality of an alarm clock and much more, turning my home into a ""smart"" home.Be prepared though, as the other day the Echo Show 5 read out quite an embarrassing text message from my girlfriend in front of my mum. While demonstrating its hands-free capabilities, I casually asked Alexa to read out my latest text. Little did I know that the timing was impeccable, that I had received an inappropriate text, and the Echo Show 5, with its clearer sound, projected the message in a way that turned a mundane demonstration into a shared moment of laughter.As the robotic voice relayed the text, my mum and I couldn't help but burst into laughter, turning an otherwise ordinary day into a memorable one. It's moments like these that remind me that technology, even in its smartest forms, can surprise us with its unexpected sense of humour and innocent-ness.One of the immediate improvements with this 3rd Gen release is the sound quality.

As the contestants take on the Screwball Scramble course, they are faced with obstacles that are both challenging and hilarious. The first challenge, the rotating disc, sends players spinning around like a record player on overdrive. Some contestants manage to keep their balance and make it across, while others end up stumbling and falling into the water below.Next up is the bridge of balls, where players must traverse a narrow walkway while dodging giant, rolling balls. It's like a scene straight out of an action movie, and the contestants are the stars of the show. Some slip and fall, while others manage to leap and dodge their way to the other side.As the game heats up, the players are faced with more and more obstacles, including the swing arm, the maze, and the final showdown: the screwball itself. This massive contraption sends players spinning and tumbling through a maze of gears and obstacles, testing their skill, endurance, and sanity.Despite the chaos and the craziness, the Screwball Scramble game is a blast for all ages. It's a classic retro game that still manages to entertain and thrill, even after all these years.

I only use mascaras that care for the lashes. With one coat/2 light coats they're still nice and soft even though the lift and hold is amazing. Wouldn't use too many coats as it's so effective, there's no need and they'd get clumpy with this formula. The brush is not my favourite to prevent this (perfect for lifting and bendy in a good way!) but can go in with a spoolie. Volume wise it's good if you haven't got many lashes otherwise it's length over volume. My lashes are curved yet it's like a lash lift with the addition of extra length and rich black pigment.Came sealed and lovely seller!

Mascara that stays on

Thought I was buying a product that I would use under my mascara in the hope it would stay on my eyelashes. This is a clumpy mascara that stays on. I’ve only worn it to work so haven’t felt the need to put mascara on as well as the effect is more than I need for work. I’m old and recently realised that I need to moisture even more which means my mascara slides off my eyelashes hence the need for primer. Despite the fact it doesn’t budge from my lashes, it comes off really easily with micellular water, possibly better than the mascara that doesn’t stay on!

Better than luxury brands
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2024Size Name: 7.2 ml (Pack of 1)Colour Name: Sky High Original BlackVerified Purchase
Throughout the past 15 years of my life, if not longer, I had been using only branded mascaras. Chanel, Dior, Givenchy, YSL, Guerlain. I didn’t like any of them! I always thought that I was not applying mascara properly: how is it possible that luxury brands give me such a poor result? Then  I started doing natural 2D eyelash extensions for a while and then dropped this as in London it is impossible to get good quality, natural, individual 2D eyelash extensions at a price below £100 every two weeks.And then when my recent Chanel mascara finished and it was time to buy a new one, I did a bit more research. Sky High was constantly coming up as a recommendation by classy Eastern European bloggers and I decided to try it.It came without a seal unfortunately, but when I opened it and checked for smudges around the entrance of the tube, there were none. So mascara wasn’t used.Initially I didn’t like it, as it gave me slightly unnatural look. But after it dried out on the lashes and a bit of time passed by, I fell in love with it! mascara looks absolutely beautiful on my eyes. It opens up the eye, no spikes, lengthens the eyelashes so much too!! Effect of natural eyelash extensions. My favourite mascara to date. Definitely prefer it to all the ones I’ve ever used. And the cost is so modest compared to what I am used to..Cheaper mascaras gave me this long strain of black sleep in the eye the next morning. Like Maybelline Colossal which I used when I was 13. Hated it and it was the key reason why since I was a teenager I would save up and prioritise to buy a more expensive mascara.Sky High, although cheap in my books, doesn’t give me this black sleep, has a very easy application without staining the eyelid, and result is STUNNING! Loving it!

 This is to die for! It doesn’t smudge throughout the day, no flaking, nice formula, dramatic black. It’s just perfect. The only thing I will say is you have to let it dry between coats otherwise you may risk taking off bits of the one you last put on, but other than that it’s perfection! Also, remember to let your micellar water soak the mascara first when taking it off, give it time to do its thing, it’s not a tubing mascara as lots of people try to advertise it as (the formula acts as one, but it doesn’t come off like one). The addition of the primer is just *chefs kiss*. A BLACK primer at that, no more white or blue sticking out from under your mascara! I couldn’t recommend these products enough! I usually go for wired brushes, but I’m now quite fond of the silicone ones because of this mascara! If you’ve been debating whether to get this for as long as I did, do ittttt, it’s 100% worth it! 🤍✨

my go-to mascara
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 March 2024Size Name: 7.2 ml (Pack of 1)Colour Name: BrownVerified Purchase
i've used this mascara for just under a year now and i don't think i'll ever change it - it works so well with my lashes and i love the brown shade. it's an ever-so-slight difference from black mascara but it does make a difference. the only downside is that it's awful for removing. no amount of miscellar water will help for me, i find the only thing that gets this stuff off is when i'm having a hot shower. this isn't a big deal for me though but if you're looking for one that's easy to remove then i'd recommend looking elsewhere - but i accept it because i love the product so much!

As an expectant mother, the Clearblue Early Detection Pregnancy Test has been an absolute blessing on my journey to motherhood! The anticipation of waiting to find out if I'm expecting is both exciting and nerve-wracking, but this test eased all my worries. Being able to get results 6 days early is a game-changer, and the 99% accuracy gave me the confidence to trust the outcome. The clear and easy-to-read display made the moment even more magical when those double lines appeared. It's an emotional and joyous experience, and Clearblue made it all the more special by allowing me to discover the wonderful news a bit earlier. This test is truly a remarkable companion for any expectant mother!

False positives
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2023Style Name: 2 TestsVerified Purchase
Like the other women in the reviews, I received false positives. I ordered two boxes (four tests in total). Three came back with a very faint blue line within the three minute timeframe. I never counted any result after ten minutes. The tests did not change at all for me. Even hours later. You could still see the same faint positive. The line was thick so it wasn’t a evap. The other one had a dye run so had to be completely discounted. I also picked up two of the same brand from the supermarket. One I used which gave me another false positive. I ran the other one under water to see if a line would appear. Absolutely nothing. Not even a hint of a line. I’ve tested on three consecutive mornings. The line hasn’t gotten darker which is usually what happens due to hcg increasing. I used it first thing in the day. Then I started to notice signs my period was coming (cramps, swollen breasts), and took that to mean I was not pregnant. However, I’ve read hundreds of accounts of women who believed they were coming in their period and were in fact pregnant. I will test again with a digital if I am late just to be certain. But, I’m 99% sure I’m not. Reading these reviews has solidified that for me. It’s important to note that on other sites, women are leaving reviews with the same issues. I wasn’t trying to conceive, but after seeing that positive I was actually excited. I cannot imagine the heartbreak of actively trying month after month, having fertility issues, having lost pregnancies, and getting a false positive result. It is absolutely criminal. These need pulling from the market.

Surprisingly good
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 December 2023Colour Name: GraphiteVerified Purchase
TLDR if you've got a Samsung smartphone, the cash to spare, and want something with more features and smarter integration than budget earphones I think these are a good buy. Sound quality is great for earbuds.I bought these off the back of many years of using another popular budget to mid range brand. These were significantly more expensive than what I usually get but I wanted to try something different and which hopefully lasts longer. These have really nice integration with my phone and a bunch of extra features. I'm particularly fond of the pass through mode which is very clear indoors and on occasion the amplified pass through setting when I'm out walking in a quiet spot and I pause the music and I want to hear what's going on around me without touching my earphones or obviously looking around. This brings me round to the only criticism I have which is although the fit test was a really nice feature I sometimes find them slipping out of position and if I push them back in I activate the play/pause touch function which cannot be remapped. It would be nice to be able to map play/pause to a double tap but sadly you can't do that in the app. Also the noise cancelling and pass through modes only work when you have both earphones in, and personally I tend to prefer only one earphone at a time. I'm still getting used to only gripping them at the very edges and that I don't need to pause first when taking them out as they will usually auto pause when they detect they are not in your ear. Voice detect is nice on paper but I'm not sure it works well enough for me as I'm typically softly spoken. It seems to lower the volume based on how loud you are talking, but for me it can end up in an awkward middle ground if I'm listening to something and start talking to someone then I can't properly hear what the other person is saying and whatever I'm listening to just becomes annoying and I'm aware I'm missing it, so I usually just end up pausing it anyway. If I speak loudly initially it will effectively mute whatever I had been listening to, which is good, but when I start talking softly again the whole exchange just comes across like I was angry at being interrupted or something. In fairness though it is very handy when I'm doing washing up not having to touch my ears. Lastly the battery life is really good, about what I have come to expect from other earphones where on the rare occasions that I have used them for extended periods I seem to get roughly 5 to 6 hours on one earphone at a medium volume (as in I can still clearly hear everything going on around me) and I charge the case maybe once or twice per week. Which while I'm on the subject the case light will shine green, yellow or red depending on how much is left in the battery, which I thought was nice. And the case seems sturdy so hopefully the top won't break off this one!Overall I think these are great so far and I would buy them again if I was looking to spend a bit more money on something good.

I was surprised by these
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2022Colour Name: GraphiteVerified Purchase
The packaging of the product feels very premium and the material used for the case especially feels extremely polished and I definitely prefer the look to the AirPods case(s)One thing I will also say is that the shape is very easy to fit the ear and the entire process feels seamless, I prefer that there is no stem as It feels like the product has a better design and for those who are unaware, these earbuds have an extremely high water resistance rating which allows me to wear these whilst in the shower.The audio quality is even better than I expected, Samsung owns the company responsible for determining the universally best EQ and it’s very clear within this product as the sound is incredible for earbuds. not too much base but also great clarity within the audio.I cannot comment on the interface since I don’t have the app due to being an iPhone user, this means that I have no access to all of the configurations that the software provides however I don’t really feel as though I need it. Noise Cancellation is automatically enabled whenever the earphones are initially turned on and in order to toggle transparency mode it is a simple hold of one of the earbuds whilst it’s in your ear.I used to own Sony XM4 headphones which had ridiculously great noise cancelling but sold them due to wanting the money back, I found that these earphones whilst (obviously) being less potent in noise cancellation, they still block out a lot of noise especially the low frequency noises such as a fan or humming etc. voices are also quite drastically muffled.I will say though that the noise cancellation is far from perfect and you may be underwhelmed if you were under the impression that these would be able to provide noise cancelling on par with actual ANC headphones. particularly when it comes to higher frequencies such as a shower etc.I am overall extremely happy with the comfort of these earbuds and didn’t even think that earphones could be this comfortable. If you’re looking for quality earphones with good noise cancelling and a great EQ then I’d have to recommend these.I will say however that if you aren’t too bothered with the 15% larger size of the buds2 pro’s predecessor (i.e., the buds pro), and don’t want better water resistance nor are you bothered too much about noise cancellation, i’d probably suggest you get the older version as as far as I can tell, those are the main differences other than more options i’m the app for the newer earbuds (which I don’t even have access to regardless)

My wife and I were bought this last year by our friends (well, she was bought it - I don't really drink) and the first thing that struck us was how stylish the bottle looks. It's a striking design that's perfect for gifts to gin lovers - it screams premium product. The flavour has noticeable hints of yuzu which is a lovely addition and offers a nice tang that is slightly different from traditional lemon or lime infusions. I sipped this to try it and even my untrained palette could get those flavours through, but Mrs Pugh, Gin Queen, holds it in even higher esteem. When it was around £21 during Prime Day, I had to snap up a bottle for her - ridiculously good value.

Excellent choice! The Cantu Coconut Curling Cream is a popular and highly regarded product in the curly hair community.This curling cream is specifically formulated with natural ingredients like coconut oil and shea butter, which work together to nourish and hydrate your curls while adding definition and hold.What sets this product apart is its ability to enhance your natural curls without leaving behind any sticky residue. It provides a lightweight and flexible hold that keeps your curls bouncy and frizz-free throughout the day.I highly recommend using the Cantu Coconut Curling Cream on damp or wet hair for best results. Start by applying a small amount to your palms, and then evenly distribute it through your hair, focusing on the ends. Scrunch and twist your curls to encourage the formation of natural, voluminous ringlets.Not only does this cream effortlessly define your curls, but it also leaves behind a pleasant coconut scent that lingers throughout the day. Many users have found that their curls are noticeably softer and more manageable after incorporating this product into their routine.Overall, the Cantu Coconut Curling Cream is a fantastic choice for anyone who wants to embrace and enhance their natural curls.

I am a male with slightly wavy hair and although it added moisture to my hair it didn’t curl it which was expected as it’s only curling cream however if you are somebody with already curly hair and want to enhance or moisturize them this product is great and very good for its price also it smells fantastic.

The BEST ever curling cream for Afro/Curly hair!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2019Scent Name: CoconutSize Name: 340 g (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I’ve been using Cantu Curling Cream for  YEARS! I recommend this hands down, it’s never let me down.Picture of my hair included for reference!My hair type is mainly all of 3C (& parts of 3B at the front) and this works on all the textures my hair has. This gives me the BEST curling definition and moisture for my hair. I use this alongside with the Wild Hair Growth Oil/Castor Oil/Grapeseed oil (any oils I have), Spray bottle of water (always the first thing before manipulating my hair) and it works amazingly. Can be layered with a leave in conditioner too.+ A denman brush, Wide tooth comb ect ect.It also smells very nice in the container and on your hair, it has a pleasant coconut aroma.It’s very smooth and thickish, I’m heavy handed so I like to lather it on throughout my hair.* twist out, braid outs and wash and go’s + numerous other Afro styles works great with this.The Cantu Curling Cream is very moisturising. I use this alongside with the LOC method for maximum moisture.I recommend buying this here on Amazon as it is much cheaper compared to buying it in Black hair stores. I buy 2-3 at a time as it’s cheaper on here.I would definitely recommend to buy this. I’ve had 0 problems with this product and it works amazingly well (for me anyway).

I have loved this perfume for a long time but it is getting harder to find it in the shops as newer versions are now available.  It is difficult to explain the smell - quite musky but sweet at the same time.  The smell lasts well.  I use this more as an evening perfume rather than a day perfume as it is quite a 'strong' smell that is a little too much for me on a day to day basis but perfect for an evening out.

Really helped my daughter drift off to sleep
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2024Verified Purchase
I will admit that I was very sceptical when I ordered these, but I was willing to give anything a try for my 10 year old who really struggles to drift off to sleep.She will usually take a long time to drift off, regardless of how tired she is, but with these stickers she is usually asleep within 15 minutes! She enjoys the smell of them, she says she feels relaxed and calm and they stop her thoughts from racing like they usually do. They smell beautiful, not overwhelming at all which can be an issue with some aroma therapy, especially if your little one is sensitive to smells. Will definitely buy again!

Didn't work for us
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2024Verified Purchase
Seen amazing reviews and hoped for the best.My husband jokingly asked if they were laced with LSD as our daughter was worse with them.What I do have to say, not wanting to be harsh about these, every child is different and dependant on their sensory needs, different senses (smell) can be impacted differently, so for most it works, which is amazing. For some it doesn't.However delivery was amazing and all the other reviews are great, I think it is definitely worth a try, If you want a child to settle, anything is worth a try.

Opposite affect and don’t stay sticky
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 March 2024Verified Purchase
I read the reviews before purchasing and knew it was going to be hit or miss , sadly it was a miss for us.The stickers don’t stay attached very well / with about half falling off in the first 20-30 minutes of being in bed.The first night my daughter actually got really upset and was worried about the smell and it resulted in her being awful at going to sleep.The next 2 nights she was strangely very hyperactive and wouldn’t go to sleep (we tried 1 sticker the first night and 2 the next 2 nights)She has always taken a while to go to sleep , sometimes up to 2 hours after being in bed and we have tried everything , but with these on it took her more than 3 hours each night to go to sleep which is by far the longest it has ever taken.I suppose the combination of things in the scent work for some children but not others.

Still plays very well on my average laptop !
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 April 2012Verified Purchase
This game really takes me back a few years ! I have lots of fond memories of playing this on the old machine that was the Playstation 2.I wanted to pick this title up on PC for something to play on my laptop when I am away from home (can't take my Xbox 360 everywhere!). I'm running a very average spec laptop on Windows 7, it's not a gaming laptop by any stretch of the imagination. I'm running an Athlon II Dual Core 2.1GB processor, 4GB ram (memory), 64-bit operating system and an ATI Mobility Radeon HD4200 graphics chip.There was no question of buying the game, only how it would run on my laptop. Got the game, installed in minutes and runs very nicely indeed ! I have to run the draw distance quite low and I haven't had any hectic moments in the game yet but it's all running smoothly. I have a feeling that it may slow down on the bigger fights but that's a small price to pay for playing this amazing game.I was prepared for the game to look very dated but I am very surprised to see that it still looks pretty fresh. I'm sure that I have hours of fun ahead of me. If you have enjoyed any of the other titles in the GTA series, you need to play this game. If you're an old fan and are making a return to the game, enjoy and dive straight in !!I hope this review helps a few people who are worried about the performance of their PC's or laptop's, if it's any higher spec than mine then you're golden.Please leave a comment if you have any questions.Martin

Just as great as the PS2 version, but buy a gamepad!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 May 2003Verified Purchase
The game is virtually identical to the PS2 version, so head over to the PS2 version of the game for some reviews there too.However, the PC version really suffers from keyboard/mouse control. Most of the game is OK, but motorcyles and helicopters are very difficult to control. If you want to play the game properly, the absolute best way is to buy a Sony PS2 controller, and an adapter to connect it to your PC, which can be picked up for less than Â£10.Changes from the PS2 version? The graphics really benefit from the higher resolution, if your PC is powerful enough, and some of the minor bugs in the PS2 version have been fixed. Unfortunately the radio stations contain less content than the PS2 version, probably becomes it comes on CDs, which can contain less data than the DVD used in the PS2 version.Only die-hard fans will want to buy this if they already have the PS2 version. If you don't have a PS2, buy this now!

This one has fluent graphics great 80s music and some very well-known Hollywood voice overs including Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, Tom Sizemore, Burt Reynolds, Lee Majors, Deborah Harry, Luis Guzman, Danny Trejo, Gary Busey, Fairuza Bulk, and Jenna Jameson to mention a few.

Best PS2 GAME EVER! (Bought again for PC)
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 September 2013Verified Purchase
i played Gta 3 after vice city just couldn't get my self to play past the first couple of missions, and same with san adreass.What makes GTA vice city stand out from the other GTA games i played is, that tommy is just a more cooler character, the location is beautiful, and the songs from the 80's are just so epic, that i can just play this game for hours just riding and listening to the heart warming music and i also find the radio talk shows quite funny, but some of the stuff they say can be related to real life, which it self is disturbing, it just shows how the ""real world"" and the ""game world"" are not that far apart.i think every console had a game to remember, for SNES it was mario world, N64 it was Zelda Ocarina of time, for playstation 2 it was vice city (some may argue san adreass)...I decided to buy this just for the sake of bringing back the memories i had after school playing this fascinating game, i really think Rockstar made a huge mistake killing of such a great character...Tommy Vercetti the closest thing to Al Pacino, infact the game has the theme of some of the greatest gangster films out there, Scarface and Carlito Way, except tommy doesn't make the same mistake as al pacino did in the end of both films...  i really loved to see what happened to him..

After having the game a good many years ago, I lost it and having some fond memories of the game decided to buy it again. The graphics, of course, look a little dated nowadays, but are still adequate for the purpose.The sound is also good, with my favourite being the radio stations that the player can choose from and are constantly played throughout the game (unless you turn them off!).The gameplay is also pretty good, and is about as non-linear as it is possible to get with this type of game.Overall, a very good game.

The ONLY features I miss;1) auto-wake to locked screen on lifting.2) Fingerprint scanner should always be on the front - never the back.3) Would be nice if predicted text was 1/2 way accurate.4) I shouldn't need a secret key to access my sandisk and phonecard - but I get it - SECURITY5) Now that I know it was worth it: Purchase with larger storage. Have gotten around this by purchasing 256GB Sandisk - YOU SEE APPLE? OFFER SOLUTIONS, NOT MORE EXPENSIVE PHONES.Positives? TOO MANY TO COUNT!Battery Life wonderful, Camera excellent, response-to-touch great, icons and general layout - easy to learn and adapt, so many actually useful features to discover even to this day and no more endless software updates (which Apple used to bombard me with - Prematurely causing my phone to reach the end of its usefulness in 12 months with 80%+ of its storage filled with 'other' software updates) etc etc.I got this unlocked Phone for £425 in Black Friday sales and put in a £10 a month Sim. This phone took me to East Africa and back - no problem as it set to cost me £240 in 2 years of use with 4GB data, Ulm Txts and Mins. Total cost £665.My iPhone cost me in total over two years £1536. That's ridiculous. I'll use the £800 odd quid saved on...Idon't know -  a holiday to Barcelona or something - it doesn't matter, I'm rich now.Anyway, the bottom-line is you can't go wrong with a policy of cash buying a two year old top-of-the-range smartphone instead of being locked in an exploitative 24 month contract.Happy Purchasing :D

Really happy with it
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 April 2022Verified Purchase
I usually don't write reviews but in this case I will.I bought this phone for a 3rd time.1st one got stolen, 2nd one was for my mum( she's happy with it) and 3rd one I had to buy it for myself again.-Battery expectancy is overall good ( yes it will get drained faster depending on how much you use it, but tell me what device doesn't).-It takes lovely photos and has good brightness. Yes it has a fragile screen as any phone these days has. ( use a case and screen protection and you'll be good).It does everything I need it to do and more.I received it as a new phone and it came the next day (I have prime)As a third time buyer this says a lot.

Really great phone - first things though. do buy a screen protector for front and back, they are available for curved screens, the one I found is case friendly too.  In that last regard do put a case on this phone, ok, if you want to wave the phone around and show it to everyone (and risk getting it pinched) this may offend someone's sense of style but the phone will not look good for very long without one - the glass is strong but will crack and scratch before long and screen replacements can be ruinously expensive.  It takes time to set the phone  up but be patient, it is worth it.  Some of the menus can be confusing but there is masses of online help.  Battery life for me, used modestly and switched off at night, is brilliant.  Turn off fast charging as this can reduce the overall life of the battery, it charges quickly anyway.  This is so much better and now the price has dropped because the S9 has come out, more affordable.

Excellent phone.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 June 2019Verified Purchase
Love this phone. After moving away from Samsung to LG I somewhat reluctantly decided to move back to Samsung after my LG died and I saw this deal on Amazon.The look, feel and performance of this phone are brilliant. It is really fast and responsive. Love the fingerprint recognition function and the fact that the phone is highly customizable thanks to Android.I received the phone on time but the reason I only give it 4 stars was that when I started  the phone to begin the initial setup the first screen gave me 2 options to select, both of which were in what looked to be German. I randomly selected one of them which caused the phone to do a factory reset but once reset the instructions were then in English.Apart from the minor setup issue the phone is great.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 August 2017Verified Purchase
This is a brilliant, great looking phone. I had the Samsung S7 Edge before I got the new Samsung S8+. The phones are very simaler but the new S8+ is a lot quicker, feels better in the hand and the screen is clearer. Great new addition to the camera with the Snapchat filters added for free!!!. Bixby is a good are also. Still getting used to it but it seems to be a good tool to have.I was very unsure about buying the phone off a 3rd party seller on Amazon as I know people how have been ripped off before and had a nightmare getting there money back but I can honestly say I am glad I did take the risk. The communication was brilliant and the phone came within 2 days of purchase in pristine condition. VERY HAPPY.It also works great with the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier watch.The only thing that was putting me off the new Samsung S8 and S8+ was the fingerprint scanner being at side of the camera on the back but it is really easy to use and to be honest it's in the perfect place for ease of use.100% HAPPY with everything

Such a great compilation!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2020Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: All-StarsVerified Purchase
Super Mario 3D All Stars is a fantastic compilation of Mario's first 3 mainline adventures. From Super Mario 64 for the 1996 Nintendo 64 console to Super Mario Galaxy on the 2006 Wii console. If you'd like to play these classics in all their glory on ""official"" hardware, go for this collection.Pros:-It's Mario!-There are 3 games, which total to just over 95 HOURS of content, if you intend to complete each title to completion (i.e all the stars, extra levels etc.)-These are graphically enchanced and have new controls that use joy-cons to their fullest.-The latest and official way to play these titlesCons:-It's expensive at 44.99 (but you ARE paying for the Mario and Nintendo brand)-It's limited until March 2021, so if you want the title, you need to get it quickly, or pay the same price for the digital copy on the eShop.-The titles are emulated, meaning they're not newly created ports, they're run from an emulator within the cartridge, so if you're someone who has a computer and likes emulation, may as well just use an emulator to play these titles, which can sometimes be better, depending on what sort of experience you want-The controls can be awkward, and the controls and camera for Super Mario 64 are VERY outdated, which may frustrate newer and younger players.In short, it's an amazing collection which you can take on the go, and has so much content that I think is definitely worth the price, but you need to grab it quickly if you want to play it, as this is a limited release which ends in March 2021.

You know what to expect.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2020Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: All-StarsVerified Purchase
4.5/5.I'll be honest - you probably know before reading this whether or not you would like this game. For me it was all about playing Galaxy again. It's possibly my favourite game of all time (maybe that's Galaxy 2), and getting to play it again on Switch it remains superb. The controls work well in place of the Wii remote's pointer, and whilst I frequently had to re-centre the pointer here it never became a hindrance.Controversially I am not a huge fan of Mario 64. I'm sure it's a great game, and you can see how it lead the way for the Mario games that have followed, but compared to the more recent games it just doesn't control well. If you're playing this for nostalgia then you'll get it, but if you've never played it before you may well struggle.Sunshine has always been devisive, with some players loving it and some really disliking it. I fall somewhere in the middle - I think it's a great game, with some issues. I finished the main game, but for me the small annoyances stopped me wanting to collect every Shine. Unlike Galaxy, in which  played to collect every Star.Overall a good package, and whilst some new features would have been nice for Mario's 35th birthday, it's a solid offering and a worthwhile addition to every Switch owner's catalogue.

Pokémon essential!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 February 2024Verified Purchase
If you are debating whether to buy this. Do it. I’m an avid player, at level 48. And this is great! Not only do you get linked up to Pokemon sleep. You get additional rewards when linking it to sleep. The auto catch will spin pokestops when you are unable to. And catch pokemon for you too. Which is perfect for when I’m driving. Just activate. In the bag. And off I go. The only down sides. The vibration! You can’t turn it off. And no matter what surface you put it on. The vibration is loud and frustrating. You can silence the sound, but just not the vibration. It’s caught a couple of 4* Pokémon for me, and shiny pokemon! So all good!

Wonderful accessory which works great for Pokémon Go & tracking Sleep data for Pokémon Sleep
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 August 2023Verified Purchase
After using the Pokémon Sleep app I realised that having my phone next to me on my bed was impractical and I decided that I wanted to try out this accessory to see if it would be better suited to tracking my sleep data. On the whole it works really well in terms of tracking my Sleep data and I've had better success tracking sleep via this than just using the app alone on my smartphone.In terms of the capabilities on Pokémon GO it gives you a lot of options compared to the original Pokémon GO Plus. You can decide whether to use regular pokeballs, greatballs or ultraballs. It still has the manual catch option but you can also get it to auto catch with a regular pokeball along with autospin for pokestops. In practical terms it works really well and seems very competent at catching mons. If your pokeball inventory is empty or if your storage is full it will flash red to inform you it cannot catch pokemon. Being able to easily inform the player of catch attempts and number of items granted from a pokestop lets you play the game without having to be always glued to the screen.In terms of connectivity it does a good job of staying connected. Once you tap on the pokeball plus icon on the game and press the button on the Pokémon Go Plus+ it pairs quickly and I've not noticed any connection drops while playing.Battery charge on the device is fantastic, I believe it's stated that it will last about a week or so on one charge which is pretty handy especially if you'll be away from home for a while. It has a rechargable battery which uses a standard USB-C connector which is perfect.Overall this is a fantastic device and if you want to take your Pokémon GO & Pokémon Sleep experience to the next level I highly recommend getting one.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 November 2023Verified Purchase
The Pokemon Go Plus +, a new accessory aimed at enhancing gameplay, comes with a mix of successes and glitches. Intended to make the game more immersive without constantly staring at the phone screen, it offers improved features like auto-throw and auto-spin. However, these features often malfunction, requiring a series of troubleshooting steps to activate and maintaining connectivity remains an issue.The device itself is well-designed, with a sleek appearance and tactile buttons that offer a satisfying experience. It includes a wrist strap and a peculiar sleep-tracking function that connects with Pokemon Sleep, although it tends to activate unintentionally throughout the day. Despite its potential, the Plus + fails to fully address the issues of the Plus line, altering gameplay dynamics and sometimes pushing players towards in-game purchases to manage inventory shortages caused by its mechanics.While it boasts improvements such as a rechargeable battery via USB-C, the glitches in auto-mode and sleep tracking currently hinder its recommendation. Additionally, its larger size compared to its predecessor makes it less convenient for everyday carry.

Cute wee ""pancake"" ball. Unlike the last pokéball that was released and connected to both the phone app and one of the switch games, this just works with Pokemon Go & Sleep.With Pokemon Sleep the ball just tracks sleep. I found the app itself not good for tracking as mine would say around 4am I wasn't asleep. The ball cannot track sounds but the app can.On Pokemon Go the ball does a bit more. There's ""sleep"" research, it can catch pokemon and spin the stops. When catching pokemon you do need to press the main button for it to do so, but with the stops you don't need to.The ball makes a lot of sounds, these can be altered in the Sleep app.Overall it's good. Pretty loud vibration when on a hard surface. I put a different charm on it rather than the yellow one that comes with it since my husband owns one too. The magnetic clip isn't the strongest.Cat likes to paw at it. 🐈‍⬛

Great update to a classic game
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2016Verified Purchase
When playing monopoly, the most tedious part was always counting out all the different notes for each player at the start of the game - it took forever!  Well that is now a thing of the past.  Each player has a Credit/Debit card and the banker operates an easy to use keypad to add/remove/transfer money between players.  This means you can open the box and be playing within 2 minutes.  The other benefit of this system is that it makes it much harder for people to cheat.  I would have given this game 5 stars but I deducted 1 star because they've increased the prices of everything (although this may have happened in other recent monopoly games, I hadn't played for about 20 years before getting this set) which I think spoils it a little bit.Other things worth noting is that only 4 people can play this version (you only get 4 bank cards) and the bank machine does need 2 AAA batteries.

Love it! Once you have had 3 or 4 goes it does make things quicker.On the first go I was lucky enough to own boardwalk and park place (this is the yank version) with 3 houses. (Once I bought the hotels everyone quit. As is usually the case with monopoly 😂)The sound from the card machine when 14mil exchanges hands is music to the ears and no counting time either.Rubbish lieces. No top hat. Only 4 plastic counters (who plays more than 4 people in monopoly but seriously the classic has metal counters)Even though I have only played once I enjoyed the difference with the electronic banking macbine. Even easier to cheat for those who can t be trusted but supervise their actions and you will be fine.Good fun.Crushed the opponents. When I upgraded to hotels from 3 houses on boardwalk and park place as well as all of the reds it cost me 25.5milHandset only accepts funds up to 20mil às that's the highest figure payable on the board.I still had 12.7mil in the bank after that.Mathematically I have this game worked out but Mayfair and park lane were unusually lucrative in game one.

I don't like the fact money was in 'M' and 'K' and ...
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 June 2015Verified Purchase
I was upset I got the US rather than UK version but apparently the Q & A is something I should not follow as situations can change. I don't like the fact money was in 'M' and 'K' and it is so easy for both adults and kids to make mistakes and you can easily add rather that minus money. It takes longer with the electronic device and it is in life as it is in a game much nicer in true Delboy fashion to look at your wad of notes! It's different and not a bad price. Just because your play pieces have to match the colour of your debit cards that are nasty plastic rather than metal. The box did not come with a display tray for the properties or houses and gave you cheap plastic bags to put them in. I bought it for my son as he has the standard Monopoly and the Walking Dead Monopoly so this was to add to the collection.

Fast, simple play with no cheating!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 April 2014Verified Purchase
The electronic version makes play so much simpler - no more messing around with change and hundreds of bits of losable paper.  Great to know your current amount at any time so you know if you can afford the rent!The first game with my husband (a known cheater of the game) was fantastic and fun.  Everything was easy to work out when mortgaging (which he had to do... a lot) and I loved watching the amount rise on the screen!

I got this for my son for Christmas and he loves it, he plays with it most days, it's not the best VR experience but it's ideal for the little ones, it's also made quite well and comfortable to wear too so it should last a long time, we got it on a offer so got it at a reasonable price, anyone thinking of getting there little one a vr then this won't disappoint, excellent for the little ones maybe not so great for the more experienced vr players though but my 7 year old loves it so definitely glad we got it him

I don’t think these are great but this does what it says on tin!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 June 2023Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
So this isn’t down to this particular company but more VR mode on switch. The switch wasn’t made to be a VR and I think that’s why these are so hard to come by. I think VR mode was probably a bit of a gimmick and I think that’s why switch disconnected their version. However, my six year old was insistent he wanted a VR headset for his switch and this one had the best reviews. The fact the modes on the games aren’t great isn’t this companies fault. This headset is comfortable and works well. Despite the fact people say these are heavy my six year old can wear it without complaint and my three year old had a little go too (him waving at toad so cute!) Me and my wife both tried tried the 3 games we gave with it too. Captain road was the best out of three we have it really felt like you were in game. Super Mario Odyssy was too far away not great. Super Smash bros a little glitchy but okay. Would I recommend this headset… if you want to give VR mode a go on a switch this is probably the best you can get!

Not fit for purpose
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 May 2023Colour Name: WhiteVerified Purchase
I bought this for my daughter in addition to the compatable games.When my daughter opened this for her birthday we tried it out. This is not compatable for the games listed the screen is pixilated and unable to see the whole screen .The bands that hold the switch in place are flimsy and could easily become loose meaning your switch would fall on the floor and break .Therfore this is not fit for purpose for adult or child. Very disappointed.Contacted via phone the company to get q refund advised to email . Emailed , still not heard back .One disappointed child and now I am out of pocket. Not an acceptable service. Very appalling service all round.

Good Value For A Cheap VR Headset
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2023Colour Name: BlackVerified Purchase
Fits adults and children. The gameplay is good for a cheap VR headset. Easy to use. My only complaint is that it is a very tight fit for the switch, meaning my children can't fit it in themselves.

Snake! SNAKE! SNAAAAAAKE!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2019Verified Purchase
Never one to ever review products on Amazon (as far as I can remember, anyway), I suddenly feel compelled to do so seeing as I impulse-bought a Playstation Classic after consistently hearing about how terrible they are; that probably makes me sound like a moron but, hey.This thing is awesome. I'm not a hardcore gamer (I have a PC that's capable of playing most games on high if not ultra settings, but it's used mostly for media editing and occasionally brutal doom). I did grow up with a couple of Playstations in the house. I didn't play every one of these games back in the day (some of them are admittedly more obscure than others). The games often look, and control, like ass.I'll assume the decision to include games like Persona Revelations, Wild Arms, Intelligent Qube, and Mr Driller was down to some behind-the-scenes difficulties (titles like Crash, Spyro, Tomb Raider and others would have been more warmly received looking at what people are saying online).To me, the Playstation Classic doesn't provide a comprehensive library of the most beloved games of its time (so it's maybe not doing the notion of a ""Classic"" console - previously executed well by Nintendo and Neo Geo - much justice); but it does provide 20 games which are still a lot of fun to play. It does it in a nice, efficient, well-presented package. It's the easiest possible thing to set up, and there's no need to install, update, prepare, or wait for anything (which is why I'd rather use this than spend time setting up a retropie).Even once you exit a game, save states allow you to immediately pick up where you left off without needing to actually save to the emulated memory cards. If you just want to switch off and play some old games for a few hours, this is a really good package. Even with Resident Evil's ass-like tank controls, or the slightly stiff driving of Destruction Derby, I honestly am having more fun with games than I've done in the past decade. It makes me nostalgic, and I'd happily have paid the original £90 for this.So it doesn't tick every box - who cares!? Neither do you, and people still like you a lot. I do, anyway.

Just remember this is for nostalgia... Great trip down memory lane
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 December 2018Verified Purchase
For what this is in my opinion is very good value and took me back a good 20 odd years from when I blew my first ever wage packet on the original. Yes it's tiny, yes it's preloaded and no you cant add games to it however there is more than enough on here to keep you occupied - don't worry, all the controls will soon come flooding back to you.It's a great piece of kit, 2 joypads (Not dual shock but you don't need them), a scart for the TV and a USB to connect to the mains (Don'tt go out and buy an adaptor, simply use the plug from your mobile or tablet device). The leads on the control are around 1.4/1.5mtrs long however the other two leads are quite long if you want to bring the unit itself closer. Graphics are as they are were in 1995 so yes they aren't going to look like the games on your smartphone or tablet so if thats what you're after then this isn't for you. For PlayStation fans this is just the ticket... Nice one Sony.

One star for no discs?? We knew that!
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 December 2018Verified Purchase
I can’t understand people complaining about 20 games, their favourite not being on here, no dualshock or not being able to change discs. (It’s almost smaller than a disc). If they refer to the disc changer button, that does work on games (that had multiple discs) when you are up to the part in tha game where a disc change is needed.... FF7 etc.I read about this on the Sony website before I bought it.Also it seems people may have forgotten that this is an old console and their phones are more powerful. So the games are a little scruffy in parts and frames dropped on the original. The graphics aren’t amazing. They weren’t in 1995.I don’t like 100% of the games. So I don’t play them. I do love some of the games and these run well, look good, play well and I’m happy I bought it.Like the nes and snes. Some games aren’t ones you will like. You can’t add or take any away (unless it’s hacked). Like those “consoles”, it’s an emulator. It’s not an actual console. It’s a piece of nostalgia. (Memberberries) And for that it does a good job. Any company making one would be accused of Ripping off Nintendo.Research before you buy. I bought it when it was just a few games revealed and knew their were no dualshocks. It’s not perfect. But it’s fun to play the old games with old style controllers.(Update)I’ve had a few comments on this review so I thought I’d respond.Their comments are all correct and I thank them for posting.Analysis has shown this does not perform as well as the original. In some cases 3 FPS are dropped, in other case 10 FPS (from 60-50).In some cases the sounds is off and the visuals blurred.Though I must say without sarcasm. When I play it. I don’t play it with FAPS counting the frames per second. I don’t play it side by side with the original to make comparison.I do play it for the games and I still enjoy it. (Personal opinion). Statistics are good and correct. But I didn’t buy it for stats.The SNES mini also drops frames , sounds are off and has some colour changes to the original. Also facts by analysis by better people than I. But I must admit not as noticeable as the PS classic. My point being it’s not perfect, especially if compared statistically and side by side. It could have been better and would have been nice if it was a perfect recreation. I just play mine. And I enjoy it.
