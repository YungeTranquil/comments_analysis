data for long-term success.<\/em><\/li> <li><strong>Competitive advantage.\u00a0<\/strong><em>Hannaford Supermarkets launched its first loyalty program in response to local competition and a desire for increased customer personalization.<\/em><\/li> <li><strong>Customer involvement. <\/strong><em>Involving customers in determining loyalty program incentives and rewards is crucial to a program&#x27;s success.<\/em><\/li> <\/ul> <p>A significant number of organizations have developed and expanded customer loyalty programs in order to reward customers with products, services or special prices in exchange for their business. The real goal of many programs is to collect data on those customers, but it can be challenging to see how that data collection may immediately impact the bottom line.<\/p> <p>Leading organizations understand that the full payoff of loyalty programs may come over time. Success may not be measured in a sudden spike in retail sales, for example, but in building trust with a customer that keeps them coming back over the long haul.<\/p> <p>Still, there are definite ways to assess how a program is doing along the way and to <a title=\"measure\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/how-do-we-measure-the-happy-customer\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">measure<\/a> whether a loyalty program has the right incentives and reward elements built into it.<\/p> <h2>Facing Competition, Hannaford Launches Its Loyalty Program<\/h2> <p>The customer loyalty program at Scarborough, Maine-based\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hannaford Supermarkets\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hannaford.com\/\">Hannaford Supermarkets<\/a> illustrates well how, and why, many organizations start such programs, and what they fully hope to gain from the effort. As is often the case with <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"customer loyalty programs\" href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/growing-a-business\/how-to-create-a-loyalty-program-that-stands-the-test-of-time\/449280\">customer loyalty programs<\/a>, what drives an organization to start one is competition in the local market. That was the case with Hannaford.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe launched our first program to only Hannaford associates in August of 2017,\u201d explained John Giaquinto, senior director of customer loyalty and digital marketing at the food store chain. \u201cTwo months later we launched to a test market in Burlington, VT. Then our full launch was January of 2018. This was Hannaford\u2019s first loyalty program at scale.\u201d<\/p> <p>The decision to launch a formal program was made to remain competitive, to be able to treat customers in a more personalized way, and to have better data on customers and the overall business, Giaquinto said. The New England region has several rival food chains vying for shoppers, and customer engagement is a key differentiator.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe have My Hannaford Rewards. It is a purely digital program,\u201d Giaquinto said. \u201cCustomers enroll, identify themselves at point-of-sale or shopping online, and they earn Rewards equal to 2% of their private brand sales. Earning in one quarter becomes a Reward that can be activated in the next quarter. In addition, there are regular, personalized campaigns and offers. Customers are alerted to offers and Rewards via mobile app, web, email, and text messages.\u201d<\/p> <p><strong>Related Article: <a title=\"Customer Loyalty Programs: Delivering the Most Bang for the Buck\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-experience\/customer-loyalty-programs-delivering-the-most-bang-for-the-buck\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Customer Loyalty Programs: Delivering the Most Bang for the Buck<\/a><\/strong><\/p> <h2>The Power of Data Can Make a Loyalty Program an Easy Sell<\/h2> <p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Designing a robust loyalty program\" href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2022\/06\/when-and-how-to-build-hurdles-into-a-loyalty-program\">Designing a robust loyalty program<\/a> requires a strong understanding of the role of technology and the importance of collecting customer behavioral data.<\/p> <p>\u201cI had always leveraged data, even when I was a marketing generalist. But my first exposure to a loyalty program was at Shaw\u2019s Supermarkets,\u201d Giaquinto said. \u201cOnce I saw how much data was available, how one could use that data to map customer behavior and to segment customers into groups, and how sophisticated the testing and experimentation could be, I was hooked.\u201d<\/p> <p>Giaquinto later became a VP of customer relationship marketing at Symphony EYC (now Symphony Retail AI), which was a consultancy for retailers with loyalty programs and loyalty data, based in metro London.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI was there for several years and helped set up the Ahold, USA and Rite Aid accounts. Seven years ago I joined Hannaford Supermarkets, then part of Delhaize and now, after the merger, Ahold Delhaize,\u201d Giaquinto explained. \u201cHannaford had plans to launch their first-ever loyalty program. They needed someone to come in, lead the build, recruit a team, launch the program, and run it. It was an incredible experience. I had the benefit of seeing how most loyalty programs never realize their full potential, and I was able to help Hannaford learn from all that experience.\u201d<\/p> <p><strong>Related Article:<a title=\"Building a Next-Level Customer Loyalty Program\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/building-a-next-level-customer-loyalty-program\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Building a Next-Level Customer Loyalty Program<\/a><\/strong><\/p> <h2>Truly Understanding What Customers Want in a Loyalty Program<\/h2> <p>One of the first lessons that Giaquinto and Hannaford learned, not surprisingly, is that customers want simple savings.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be mathematically obvious \u2014 so simple they can calculate the worth of every transaction,\u201d Giaquinto said. \u201cBut it has to be simple to articulate and to understand. And they want to see at least occasional values that seem worth the effort, or at least somewhat proportionate to how much shopping they do.\u201d<\/p> <p>But customers typically want much more than just a cut-rate, said <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Howard Schneider\" href=\"https:\/\/howardschneider.net\/\">Howard Schneider<\/a>, a consultant specializing in customer loyalty and engagement.<\/p><section class=\"styles_learning-opportunities-block__3X2MP\"><h2 class=\"styles_learning-opportunities-block__header__2W3Un\">Learning Opportunities<\/h2><section class=\"styles_learning-opportunities-block__carousel__desktop__1_czX\"><div class=\"carousel\"><div class=\"carousel__viewport\"><div class=\"carousel__container\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><section class=\"styles_learning-opportunities-block__carousel-section__2wvu5\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www-cmswire.simplermedia.com\/wb-240411-adobe-cx.html?smg_source=cmswire.com&amp;smg_medium=web&amp;smg_campaign=wb-240411-adobe-cx&amp;smg_content=evt-cal\" class=\"learning-opportunities-card\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__category-name\">Webinar<\/div><figure class=\"learning-opportunities-card__image image__wrapper\"><div class=\"image-container\"><img class=\"image\" alt=\"Web SDK Adobe\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/div><\/figure><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__content-section\"><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__date\"><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__month-date\">Apr<\/div><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__day-date\">11<\/div><\/div><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__text-section\"><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__title\">Upgrading to Modernized Data Collection for Adobe Analytics With Web SDK<\/div><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__description\">Learn how to simplify and streamline your data.<\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__cta-wrapper\"><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__action\"><span class=\"learning-opportunities-card__action-text\">Register<\/span><svg width=\"9\" height=\"14\" viewBox=\"0 0 9 14\" fill=\"#FF8E19\"><path d=\"M0.737055 0.111134L0.111111 0.737047C-0.0370369 0.885194 -0.0370369 1.1254 0.111111 1.27358L5.8239 7L0.111111 12.7264C-0.0370369 12.8746 -0.0370369 13.1148 0.111111 13.2629L0.737055 13.8889C0.885202 14.037 1.12541 14.037 1.27359 13.8889L7.8942 7.26828C8.04235 7.12013 8.04235 6.87992 7.8942 6.73174L1.27359 0.111134C1.12541 -0.0370448 0.885202 -0.0370448 0.737055 0.111134V0.111134Z\" fill=\"#0093D3\"><\/path><\/svg><\/div><\/div><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www-cmswire.simplermedia.com\/wb-240418-sprinklr-cx.html?smg_source=cmswire.com&amp;smg_medium=web&amp;smg_campaign=wb-240418-sprinklr-cx&amp;smg_content=evt-cal\" class=\"learning-opportunities-card\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__category-name\">Webinar<\/div><figure class=\"learning-opportunities-card__image image__wrapper\"><div class=\"image-container\"><img class=\"image\" alt=\"Tailor strategies for maximum impact across businesses of all sizes.\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/div><\/figure><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__content-section\"><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__date\"><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__month-date\">Apr<\/div><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__day-date\">18<\/div><\/div><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__text-section\"><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__title\">Redefining Social CX: Drive Growth and Foster Loyalty at Every Touchpoint<\/div><div class=\"learning-opportunities-card__description\">Transform social interactions into a competitive edge.

The loyalty program is a tactical way to deliver both.<\/p> <p>Customers want what Schneider calls the basic value proposition: What do I get for doing business with you? How do I feel about doing business with you? Do I feel respected? Do I feel like you&#x27;re listening? Do I feel a sense of status and belonging? And am I getting good value?<\/p> <p>\u201cThere&#x27;s a combination of material and emotional reward that builds transactional and behavioral loyalty respectively,\u201d Schneider said.<\/p> <p><strong>Related Article: <a title=\"Customer Retention Strategies for Driving Loyalty in Uncertain Times\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/customer-retention-strategies-for-driving-loyalty-in-uncertain-times\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Customer Retention Strategies for Driving Loyalty in Uncertain Times<\/a><\/strong><\/p> <h2>Giving Customers a Voice in Determining the Elements of Reward<\/h2> <p>If an organization is going to be successful at offering the right incentives and rewards, it is important to involve customers in determining what those perks are, Giaquinto stressed. Hannaford did extensive research prior to finalizing the structure and requirements of its program.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe also continue to measure customer attitudes and preferences related to the program, through large, market-wide customer surveys and smaller panels,\u201d Giaquinto said. \u201cBut we also firmly believe that people \u2018vote with their feet,\u2019 and we rank behavioral data above everything. We watch for changes in engagement with different parts of our program, test values and structures of offers, and adjust based on customer reactions.\u201d<\/p> <p>Otherwise, Giaquinto said, somewhat jokingly, \u201cThe short answer is we measure in every way we can. We leverage a robust test and control methodology to measure our campaigns, which are short-term programs. We leverage a match-panel methodology or \u2018synthetic control\u2019 for our Rewards, because we can\u2019t hold out a true control group.\u201d<\/p> <p>Both of those methodologies enable Hannaford to estimate incremental visits and sales generated by the different elements of the program. This, in turn, enables the company to calculate the efficiency of the program. Success is defined as, essentially, for every dollar invested in discounts, offers, or Rewards, how many are generated in additional sales?<\/p> <p>\u201cFinally we also look at customer migration,\u201d Giaquinto continued. \u201cMigration means, how people are moving from one level of engagement with Hannaford to higher levels of engagement.\u201d<\/p> <h2>Tips for Designing and Measuring a Successful Loyalty Program<\/h2> <p>As organizations look to develop or refine a loyalty program, Schneider stressed that a program \u201cneeds to be dynamic. It needs to have the ability to change. You&#x27;re not going to immediately devise the perfect program, and then set it and forget it.\u201d<\/p> <p>Organizations need to watch what customers do, both from a data perspective, and from a customer feedback perspective, Schneider said. From a competitive perspective, organizations need to be able to react to events and trends. They must anticipate what comes next. They may need to add new partners and new features, and respond to the competition, Schneider said.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Finally, Giaquinto offered what he terms \u201cthree main buckets of advice.\u201d<\/p> <h3>Focus on Behavior that Matters<\/h3> <p>\u201cWe need to monitor different metrics when we test and optimize, but they are not all equal. Some metrics are \u2018intermediary\u2019 observations,\u201d Giaquinto pointed out. \u201cFor example, if you are able to get more people redeeming personalized offers that\u2019s likely a good thing, because it might indicate you created more customer engagement, which created more sales. But if the result doesn\u2019t translate into some higher-order metric like incremental sales or retention, then it\u2019s not as much of an accomplishment.\u201d<\/p> <h3>Differing Effects at Different Time Intervals<\/h3> <p>\u201cRetention is a long-term proposition. By definition, it is an effect that is observed over time,\u201d Giaquinto said. \u201cCampaigns are usually short-term, transactional programs, and effects can be observed on a much shorter time scale. If you look for effects on one-time scale, or in only one way, you may miss the most important effects. In my experience long-term effects of multiple campaigns, leveraging a universal control, are usually three to four times the sum of the short-term campaign effects. I\u2019ve seen that a few times at different retailers and have talked to industry peers who have seen it at others. I\u2019m not ready to say it\u2019s a universal law \u2026 but my recommendation is to design your program, do your projections, and create measurements that capture this.\u201d<\/p> <h3>Think Scale<\/h3> <p>\u201cAlways earn your keep,\u201d Giaquinto advised. \u201cIf you create a sophisticated program that gets left-handed customers to buy one more can of soup when the humidity is low, you\u2019ve technically created incremental sales. But you have also squandered corporate resources for something that has no chance to drive sales observable at the top line, or to create market share to any measurable degree.

Hannaford did extensive research prior to finalizing the structure and requirements of its program.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\u201cWe also continue to measure customer attitudes and preferences related to the program, through large, market-wide customer surveys and smaller panels,\u201d Giaquinto said. \u201cBut we also firmly believe that people \u2018vote with their feet,\u2019 and we rank behavioral data above everything. We watch for changes in engagement with different parts of our program, test values and structures of offers, and adjust based on customer reactions.\u201d\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-body-ad-placeholder\\\"\\u003e\\u003c\/div\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOtherwise, Giaquinto said, somewhat jokingly, \u201cThe short answer is we measure in every way we can. We leverage a robust test and control methodology to measure our campaigns, which are short-term programs. We leverage a match-panel methodology or \u2018synthetic control\u2019 for our Rewards, because we can\u2019t hold out a true control group.\u201d\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBoth of those methodologies enable Hannaford to estimate incremental visits and sales generated by the different elements of the program. This, in turn, enables the company to calculate the efficiency of the program. Success is defined as, essentially, for every dollar invested in discounts, offers, or Rewards, how many are generated in additional sales?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\u201cFinally we also look at customer migration,\u201d Giaquinto continued. \u201cMigration means, how people are moving from one level of engagement with Hannaford to higher levels of engagement.\u201d\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eTips for Designing and Measuring a Successful Loyalty Program\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs organizations look to develop or refine a loyalty program, Schneider stressed that a program \u201cneeds to be dynamic. It needs to have the ability to change. You're not going to immediately devise the perfect program, and then set it and forget it.\u201d\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOrganizations need to watch what customers do, both from a data perspective, and from a customer feedback perspective, Schneider said. From a competitive perspective, organizations need to be able to react to events and trends. They must anticipate what comes next. They may need to add new partners and new features, and respond to the competition, Schneider said.\\u0026nbsp;\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eFinally, Giaquinto offered what he terms \u201cthree main buckets of advice.\u201d\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-body-ad-placeholder\\\"\\u003e\\u003c\/div\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFocus on Behavior that Matters\\u003c\/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\u201cWe need to monitor different metrics when we test and optimize, but they are not all equal. Some metrics are \u2018intermediary\u2019 observations,\u201d Giaquinto pointed out. \u201cFor example, if you are able to get more people redeeming personalized offers that\u2019s likely a good thing, because it might indicate you created more customer engagement, which created more sales. But if the result doesn\u2019t translate into some higher-order metric like incremental sales or retention, then it\u2019s not as much of an accomplishment.\u201d\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eDiffering Effects at Different Time Intervals\\u003c\/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\u201cRetention is a long-term proposition. By definition, it is an effect that is observed over time,\u201d Giaquinto said. \u201cCampaigns are usually short-term, transactional programs, and effects can be observed on a much shorter time scale. If you look for effects on one-time scale, or in only one way, you may miss the most important effects. In my experience long-term effects of multiple campaigns, leveraging a universal control, are usually three to four times the sum of the short-term campaign effects. I\u2019ve seen that a few times at different retailers and have talked to industry peers who have seen it at others. I\u2019m not ready to say it\u2019s a universal law \u2026 but my recommendation is to design your program, do your projections, and create measurements that capture this.\u201d\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eThink Scale\\u003c\/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\u201cAlways earn your keep,\u201d Giaquinto advised. \u201cIf you create a sophisticated program that gets left-handed customers to buy one more can of soup when the humidity is low, you\u2019ve technically created incremental sales. But you have also squandered corporate resources for something that has no chance to drive sales observable at the top line, or to create market share to any measurable degree. You should be designing your program to be at a scale proportionate to your company and its market.\u201d\\u003c\/p\\u003e\",\"publicationDate\":\"2023-04-26T13:12:39Z\",\"lastPublishedDate\":\"2023-05-15T10:48:28Z\",\"primaryCategory\":{\"title\":\"Customer Experience\",\"url\":\"\/customer-experience\/\"},\"topicId\":\"Default Topic\",\"socialSharing\":{},\"sophisticationLevel\":\"Knowledgeable\",\"isAdDisabled\":false,\"additionalPerspectiveDescription\":\"\",\"additionalPerspectiveSubtext\":\"\",\"additionalPerspectiveTitle\":\"\",\"additionalPerspectiveFeaturedImageUrl\":\"\",\"additionalPerspectiveFeaturedImageAlt\":\"\",\"isSponsored\":false},\"relatedArticlesData\":[{\"href\":\"\/customer-experience\/what-is-customer-analytics-and-why-it-matters\/\",\"id\":\"edad70f6-4cb3-4f5e-ad55-da37d5e06620\",\"contentType\":\"Feature\",\"imgSrc\":\"\/-\/media\/784b3e020d074ee8b451f083eba06cd6.ashx\",\"imgAlt\":\"A sign post on a beach.\",\"channel\":\"Customer Experience\",\"title\":\"What Is Customer Analytics?

So I've been at LinkedIn on the customer experience team for close to three years now. And our customer experience team is really focused on \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/what-is-customer-experience-design-benefits-best-practices\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"experience design\\\"\\u003eexperience design\\u003c\/a\\u003e. So we do journey mapping, qualitative research. We have a bunch of techniques we use to prioritize and set up for execution with some of our cross functional colleagues, changes to the experience based on what we learned in our research and our journey mapping.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd with the experience insights team who are colleagues of ours in sort of the same larger organization, but on a different team. They have all the customer data, they're doing surveys and collecting other forms of feedback, where they're soliciting feedback from customers.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut then they also have inbound data and operational data.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo social media comments, I mean, we are a social media platform. So it was a comment on the platform on LinkedIn, support tickets, data from our platform, so from usage, page times and those types of things.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so we're using all of that data, one as inputs to our experience, design work and our journey mapping. But even further back, we're using it to help us determine where we should be working, what projects we should be doing next, what parts of the experience, need our focus, so that we can take effort out for customers take effort out for employees.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/what-do-customer-experience-teams-actually-look-like\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"What Do Customer Experience Teams Actually Look Like?\\\"\\u003eWhat Do Customer Experience Teams Actually Look Like?\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Customer Experience\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 2:48:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e What are some of those big top level KPIs amongst that data? You know, what are the top few that you're really looking at day to day? You're thinking about it when you're not working? Like those KPIs that kind of like, okay, we gotta get this number up, or we gotta have this number, do this, this number, do that? Are there a few of those that stand out? Yes.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 3:08:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eSo first and foremost, trust, the emotion of trust is something that we take very seriously, we track and measure, trust is not much evidence for the big social media platforms, except it is for LinkedIn. So it's really down to LinkedIn, and Pinterest that are the two social media platforms that people trust these days. And we take that very seriously that responsibility to maintain that trust. So trust is something that we're tracking, as well as perceived value. So our customers feel like they're getting value for money for their services that they're spending, and then also ease of doing business. So are we taking effort out of the process? Are we automating things that can be automated or removing steps that don't need to be taken by customers or by employees? So those, I would say, would be the three big ones: trust perceived value and effort?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe Distinction Between Customers and Members at LinkedIn\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 3:54:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e One point you mentioned to me in our pre talks was the difference between customers and members. I think this conversation, people would love to know the difference in how you guys view those, it's two different buckets, right?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 4:07:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eSo it's interesting, because it's every customer, I think I can say this, every customer is a member. But if you think about your relationship with LinkedIn, you're probably thinking about a member relationship. If you're listening to this podcast episode, you're a member of LinkedIn. And that's who we honor first, because the ability of members to get value to find interesting opportunities, whether it's jobs, whether it's people to work with, whether it's content that's going to help them be better in their role that keeps them coming back to the platform that gets them to trust us and see value from us. And it's that engagement that makes LinkedIn an appealing platform to customers. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so then many of those members not all of course, because we have 1 billion plus members, but many of those members become customers when they need to hire someone when they want their Salesforce to better target by using Sales Navigator when they want to buy learning products, all the different doughnuts we have. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo we're trying to balance the needs of both right? We want the customers to get value from the ads that they place on LinkedIn or find great candidates for their jobs. But equally on the other side, we want members to feel like they're getting great jobs because what we always say is we're trying to unlock economic opportunity for everyone. And so in both directions, we want to create that mutually beneficial marketplace and platform.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eStrategies for Managing and Utilizing Customer Feedback\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 5:23: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eAnd those members are very chatty on LinkedIn. I know if people make comments, they make statements. It's emotional, please. I mean, it is just a forum for world dialogue, really just have what's on your mind professionally. What's on your mind personally, sometimes, I like the touch when a lot of people go personal. I'm like, I didn't know that about this person. You know, the question I'm getting at for a CX person on LinkedIn, a CX manager, like yourself, what do you do with that massive amount of material? Right? There's so many posts, so many comments, so many replies, so many groups, private groups, public groups, webinars, LinkedIn live, people are saying things every second on LinkedIn. So how does the CX team gather all those insights? And what do you do with them? It's\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 6:16: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eAn incredible amount of data, as you said, being generated. So a lot of times we're looking at trends, and we're looking at responses in activity and behavior on the platform to changes that we make, for example, when we implemented \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-experience\/6-ways-generative-ai-is-changing-content-management\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"AI generated key takeaways\\\"\\u003eAI generated key takeaways\\u003c\/a\\u003e from articles or from newsletters, we want to see how many people are using that are more people reading the articles that are they engaging with the content more? \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo a lot of times it's about because it's such an overwhelming amount of information, as you said, it's about using that information to focus ourselves on reviewing tests are changes that we've made using the data and focusing on a specific area, because if you're trying to look at it all at once, it's obviously overwhelming. If you're using it to make a decision about whether a new feature you implemented was successful or not. It's much easier in that case, right? Because you have great data coming in and you've focused on a very specific, narrow, tailored question to answer with that data.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 7:10:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eShould I put my link in the post Sam, or in the comments? That's a big debate, right? This is totally off subject in a bit. I'm just, I was just thinking of it, right? Because we post all the time on LinkedIn. And it's a big part of our business, social media strategy, and not just like, hey, hey, that guy's doing it differently. How do I do it?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 7:28:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eI know, I think actually put it in the comments. Okay. Yeah. Because I think it formats strangely in post. I don't know why we haven't made that easier. But yeah, usually, what you'll see a lot is people write the post, and then, you know, point you to the first comment, usually from themselves, of course, for the post to the podcast, or the article, you know, on another site, or wherever it is. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eIntegrating Employee Experience (EX) with Customer Experience (CX)\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 7:52: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eLet's talk about that \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/why-organizations-benefit-by-embracing-cx-and-ex-synergy\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"EX and CX dynamic\\\"\\u003eEX and CX dynamic\\u003c\/a\\u003e that you alluded to quickly.

So when I was at Forrester, I did a lot of research, I was on the customer experience research team. But I did a lot of research on employee experience, and customer centric culture, and how both of those support delivering a great customer experience. And with LinkedIn, integrating that employee experience with customer experience, our last podcast, guests had a great example of like, their NPS was low, if a call center call went more than like 15 minutes, right? And a manager would come on at that point, and would remind the agent about, hey, this is the time to maybe shift pivot, what can I do to help kind of thing? And that was a great example to me of using \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/cx-and-ex-great-cx-improves-employee-experience-too\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"CX insights to fuel EX\\\"\\u003eCX insights to fuel EX\\u003c\/a\\u003e. Because now the agent is having a better experience. Maybe the call goes better, and maybe they get better grades after, right? What are some examples there for your team, the infusion of EX with CX and kind of how you're looking at that.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/is-it-time-to-make-cx-and-ex-one-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Is It Time to Make CX and EX 'One Experience'?\\\"\\u003eIs It Time to Make CX and EX 'One Experience'?\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 9:05: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eFor us. It's interesting, so much of our customers' interactions with us are digital on the platform with our tools and services. But we have large Salesforce, large customer success teams, we have customer support. And all of those customer facing roles and teams, they're there for really important moments of the experience, the account setup, or the walking you through how to use a new product, or when you have an issue and an error, and you get to global support. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo we think of that interplay, as the platform should work, the product should work, but when they don't, the humans, the people, the employees stand behind that and make sure that we back that up. And I think again, to me, that's part of the equation of trust, it should work and if it doesn't, we stand behind that to fix it to make it work. We back up our experience. And we want to make sure that those employees are equipped to deliver a great experience in those moments because those moments will be really important. and really memorable to customers if they go well, or if they do not go well. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so that means giving them access to data and knowledge about the customers, and the context and where they were before they got to that point, and the experience and the feedback, there's a tool we use to sort of let sales reps and Customer Success reps record, and then listen back to their calls and sort of use that as training to get better on their customer calls. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd all of that is designed to sort of help those \\u003ca href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/fusing-voice-of-the-customer-and-voice-of-the-employee\/\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\" title=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/fusing-voice-of-the-customer-and-voice-of-the-employee\/\\\"\\u003ecustomer-facing employees\\u003c\/a\\u003e get better and better at nailing those key moments in the experience, because we know that the human delivered moments in an experience are more memorable, either good or bad. We're human, we're used to sort of interacting with people. So we're social beings, we remember that kind of stuff. So those moments are few and far between, as they are still really impactful because they live long in the customer's memory.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eBalancing Employee Experience With Customer Insights\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 10:50:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, and that experience insight team, the one that collects the data, your teams and any other team really around the CX effort at LinkedIn, are there KPIs that they have for the employees, like, you know, sometimes there's employee Net Promoter Score, right, or employee effort score, whatever you call it? Are you looking at some employee data alongside your customer data? \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 11:13:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eSo we have ease of doing business with LinkedIn, which is about making it easier for customers to work with us. And we also have ease of doing business at LinkedIn. And that's for employees. And my team has done some research with our customer-facing employees. And it's clear to us that there's a lot of effort we can take out of their daily work. And it's daily work that is preventing them from doing their more important daily work, namely, being on calls with customers. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo as much as we can do to remove some of that effort to track activities, or to keep their book of business updated, or whatever it is, we can make that easier or automate parts of that, then we're freeing up hours for them to spend more time preparing for client meetings on client meetings. And that's high value, high productivity time for customer facing employees. So that's a big metric for us, as we think about the employee experience is, do they feel like it's easy to work at LinkedIn and get their jobs done and deliver value to our customers?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 12:12:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, like, is there an actual, like, scientific model for that? Or is it a lot of anecdotal data? It's a lot of spreadsheets, like the ease of doing business. Is it actually, is there a formula behind that?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 12:23:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eThat's a good question. So it is a little bit of a mix, we are doing sort of, we're asking them to give us time estimates for how much time they're spending on things. But then we're tracking some of that, and some of the systems how much time they're spending doing certain tasks. And we've done some time diary studies. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo we are trying to collect some of that data directly. But also, the actual amount of time it takes is important, and it's great to have, but how they perceive that time is really important. If it feels like it's taking a long time. And it feels onerous, even if it's not, that's valuable information, because we know they're really feeling like, you know, maybe it only took them five or 10 minutes, but they just thought it was painful. And it took way longer than it should. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd that's going to impact them, that's going to sort of bring them down a little bit. They're not going to have the same sort of sunny effect when they're talking to our customers later. So we want to manage that as well, their perception of how much effort or how much time things take.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/the-art-of-balancing-employee-experience-and-customer-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"The Art of Balancing Employee Experience and Customer Experience\\\"\\u003eThe Art of Balancing Employee Experience and Customer Experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 13:34:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Those CX leaders (at a Forrester event in 2022) were talking about agent experience more than anything, when I was talking to them at the lunch tables in the hallways and what have you. And on stage, I was fascinated by that. I'm like, wow, we really are moving towards an EXE type of CX dynamic here that has to be baked in. What have you learned lately, from all these insights with the ease of doing business at LinkedIn? What are some big top level concerns of these customer facing employees? And what have you done on the back end to kind of address these challenges?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 14:07:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, we have learned that employees want to feel and want to believe that they are critical to have some part of the experience that what they do matters. And that is seen that that is respected right, in an organization like LinkedIn, where it's mostly digital, you could see how maybe they would think what they did wasn't valued as much as you know, the platform activity. And so they want to know that we understand we, the rest of the organization understand the critical role they're playing in our experience. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd as you were just alluding to \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/a-4-step-recipe-for-improving-your-contact-center-agent-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"agent experience\\\"\\u003eagent experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e, you know, the concept of that moment of service recovery when something did go wrong. There's many, many instances where that saves the relationship. They're heroes. It's a you know, it's like a game saving diving catch in the outfield. So it's on that level. That's really important. And what they also want to feel is that they are empowered to deliver that experience. So do they have the information they need? \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eDo they have the permission to spend the time needed with that customer to give them the experience they need. And then enabled to do they have the data they need, do they have the tools? Do they have the training so that when they're in these interactions with customers, they feel like they are set up for success. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eThose are feelings that when they feel enabled, when they feel seen when they feel empowered to do what's necessary to deliver the right experience for customers, that has been sort of a really sturdy equation that lasts, right that when you set up employees with those beliefs, and those success factors, they will mostly almost always deliver a really good experience to customers. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo that's what we've been focused on is getting them to that feeling where the data they have worked for them and are at their fingertips to tell them about the customer, and where they feel like they can take a few extra minutes with that customer if they need to. Because we're tracking performance. But we also have some leeway in that if they find a customer needs a little extra attention. Those types of things make them feel empowered, right?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/contact-center\/the-importance-of-contact-center-agent-well-being\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"The Importance of Contact Center Agent Well-Being\\\"\\u003eThe Importance of Contact Center Agent Well-Being\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 15:59:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e I've had 25-minute awesome conversations with call center agents, you know, where, I like to talk.

It just goes beyond that duration, right?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 16:22:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003e100%. And just to your example, that agent using their judgment and their skills to assess that, hey, I've got Dom on the phone, and he wants to chat, I'm going to stay on with him, right, versus someone else. It's like this person's in a hurry, might hear the kids in the background, I'm going to process this as quickly as possible. Again, that's a sense of empowerment that we trust the agents to read and react with what the customer is looking for in that moment, right and adjust the experience and service they deliver accordingly. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 16:50: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eOne thing I think that companies want to get better at CX team, CX leaders is taking the feedback from the agent and using it effectively. Because how do you capture that? I don't want to say water cooler, everyone says that I hate that when any of us even talk over water cooler, when the agents are talking to each other after work, or they have a smoke break or something like that. A zoom break, if you will, if they're remote, right? How do you capture those moments? Right? I mean, where they're talking about customers, how they solve the problem. The agents have a wealth of data and anecdotes that can fuel better customer experiences. So is there a strategy there with collecting agent feedback \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/contact-center\/the-power-of-the-super-agent-the-key-to-customer-satisfaction\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"agent experience\\\"\\u003eagent experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 17:33:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, so one of the things that we do, and totally share that perspective that we are always trying to get more of that information. To me, it's sort of thinking about, like, there are things they know, and they've known them so long, or they've adapted so well to work around or adjusting to whatever their constraints are in their the employee experience for the experience they have to deliver, that they might not even be able to tell you about them if you just ask. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo we'd like to get them to show us. So we'll use a technique called contextual inquiry where we'll sort of ride along with them and have them share their screen and show us the different steps. They're going through the different systems, they have to click through to complete something. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd it's hilarious to me, because first of all, they have like 30 tabs open, and they're clicking around. And then they'll say, oh, and I see this data point, that means I'm gonna have to go to this other system and grab this piece of information. It's like, well, how do you know that? Like? Well, I've been here for three years. So I just figured that out. At some point, we note that down because it's like, no new employee is going to be able to do that on day one. And so now we have a training opportunity, or we have a process thing that we want to fix, right? Because it's like, as soon as someone tells us they figure that out, or someone else told them, but it's not the prescribed way of doing things. That's a moment for us to go and try and fix.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/contact-center\/ai-in-contact-centers-championing-your-agents\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"AI in Contact Centers: Championing Your Agents\\\"\\u003eAI in Contact Centers: Championing Your Agents\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 18:46:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e And I think that's the moment where you realize that we just have to do it like Undercover Boss, does it? Does she ever. Yeah, just go. It's like a verb for me: go undercove-boss-it, right? Yeah, go sit in their shoes. Watch how they do it. So that's like the reverse effect that's starting with employee experience, to fuel customer experience, because if that first week, employee, first day employee is going to benefit from your efforts of seeing what's wrong with the three year employee, and in turn, probably going to help the customer.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 19:17:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eAbsolutely. And actually, you know, to that point about helping the customer, they will often in those sessions tell us about things that are driving case volume that are known to them, issues for the customer, they're like, Yeah, this always comes up and it's a problem, you know, with billing or with provisioning this new product or whatever it is. And we're sitting there thinking and listening to what they need, but we're also thinking hmm, that's something we should go talk to product about, like I bet that should work differently than if they're telling us it's working in ideally then wouldn't drive as many support tickets.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe Role of AI and Future Directions for CX and EX\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 19:48:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eThe past couple of weeks or so Sam, like give me an example of like a standout call center employee that you just had a great moment with. I'm fascinated with that interaction between call center leader and your call center manager, like someone in your shoes, someone in your team shoes, working with the front line? Is there an actual vivid moment that you can recall?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 20:08:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, yeah. So we've been doing this research for the last few weeks with customer support. And I was reviewing some of the videos just this morning because we're sort of splicing together some of the clips from some of the research to sort of make a recap video. And I was watching one gentleman in our global support be interviewed by a couple of my colleagues. And what he was saying, and I think this is what's so powerful about these folks is he was talking about when he has to spend two hours on a really complex support ticket.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd my colleague asked him, she said, doesn't that hurt your cue percentage time and your calls per hour handled? And he said, Oh, yeah, it craters it. I know, I'm done for the day, like, it's gonna be a bad day. He's like, so what I do is I communicate to my manager to tell her this is what I'm doing and she almost always backs me and supports me and she understands. And we are going to put a little note on my performance for that day. But it's the right thing to do for the customer, the customer needs that much help. And I can make a difference. And that's really inspiring to hear. He's taking a hit. Now, maybe we should justify metrics a little bit, but he's taking a hit there to do the right thing for the customer. And he's getting the support from his manager in doing it. And I just love that example.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 21:20:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eThat is gold. That is gold. And to get to that point, Sam, it's a credit to your team, because you have to make the effort to review and talk to these people one on one, right? I think a lot of CX leaders might get buried in the data, the KPIs, the board meetings, and all that stuff that matters, but doesn't it matter as much as that customer-facing employee working with a customer, that one on one transaction that can bring the company down? Yeah. So they need to be empowered. So I guess my question to you is like, what kind of advice do you give to CX leaders to get out of their day to day and make time? Yeah, sounds like you have a pretty good system there, you were watching some videos, then you went to the employee.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 22:02:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u0026nbsp;I do think even in this age of incredible volumes of data, and we've talked about that already. \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-marketing\/quantitative-and-qualitative-data-research-for-marketers\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Qualitative research\\\"\\u003eQualitative research\\u003c\/a\\u003e absolutely still has a role to play, getting this kind of rich feedback. And it's so complimentary to the big sets of data that we all have access to. So I think to me, that's first is you have to be planning to prepare to do qualitative research to complement the more quantitative sets of data that we already have coming in. And then as you said, I think the power of seeing it, so it's for me, seeing it, seeing him talk about it, and show my colleague on his system where he had to spend this extra time, but then putting that video together and sharing it with our colleagues to show them because they might say, well, he should have gone to this system. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd it's like, well, look at all the tabs he has opened, do you really think he's going to find that or no, that in the moment when he's taking two chats at once with customers, when you see the employee in the convoluted systems that they're going through on screen on video, and you hear them talking about it, that is unassailable, people can push back on that that's just real. And so we really like to use that we're trying to do that more and more these days by showing the videos to our colleagues, when we present when we do the deliverables, to highlight some of the key findings and the research and the sessions that we hold. That's the evidence that's hardest for people to look away from is what I found.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eLeveraging Journey Mapping for Enhanced Customer and Employee Experiences\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 23:18:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eHaving those insights is just amazing. And I know, your team really focuses on that qualitative research, like you said, in the journey mapping to I know, journey mapping, and we haven't really talked about that. And a lot of folks talk about employee journey mapping and customer journey mapping. But it sounds like you guys are really doubling down on that customer journey mapping. How do we get there? How do you get to that point? And sort of where do you start?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 23:42:\\u0026nbsp;\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eSo yes, we do a lot of journey mapping, both \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/surviving-the-journey-of-customer-journey-mapping\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"customer and employee journey mapping\\\"\\u003ecustomer and employee journey mapping\\u003c\/a\\u003e when we're looking at the employee experience. And it flows from the data that we have access to from experience, insights team and the qualitative research that we do. So we sort of, you know, we start there. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd then a lot of what we're doing, we're aiming to do with with conducting that research with ingesting that data, is to start to turn it into a rich understanding of the experience from end to end, which is every CX Pro on Earth basically is finding that it's best visualized through a journey map. So that's how we do it too. And what I found it's been really valuable since the pandemic and I think a lot of folks have found this is we now do it all digitally, all remote, and it makes it really easy to have collaboration with our colleagues to get their inputs to the journey map. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo you know if we're going to look at okay, well, what is the process that underpins these steps in the journey for the employee to talk to the business process team and get their input for that part? What are the metrics these employees are being held to we get that from the managers and that team, we can end the journey with go one by one, we can have people review it, we can share it with people, I found that that's a really powerful way to sort of open up those conversations with our cross functional partners by taking time to sort of show them the journey map, walk them through it and also get their inputs and almost in real time with them on the call with us sharing our screen. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAdd their input to the map, so they can see that it's there. And it's included. The other thing I'll say, though, is we also do a lot of service blueprinting and future state journey mapping. And again, it's really just sort of you wanting to capture the current state and understand what's working and what's not. But we don't want to wallow in the pain that we're causing our customers, our employees. So we want to make sure as well to frame up what it could be like if we addressed some of the issues that we found in the current state map. So that's the other technique, I think is important is to sort of not only document what's happening today, but to help colleagues imagine what's possible tomorrow.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 25:34:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eCan you recall any changes recently from these journey mapping sessions and learnings and these cross functional calls, like anything that's recently made a big change because of your journey mapping work?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 25:47:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eThis is going back a couple of years. But this was a project we had worked on, we found that there was maybe not enough of a ritual around a customer's ad campaign experience on the site. What I mean is when they run a campaign marketing campaign, they get the results back, it's sort of just here the results, here's the dashboard, there was an opportunity there to help them memorialize it, you know, for the first campaign, if it was a really successful campaign, if it was going to lead to these business results. And that came out of doing research for customers, what are they going to do with the data? \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eWhat are they going to do with the results from the campaign, and we saw that it was like, this is something where there's real alignment between that individual customer and LinkedIn, assuming it's successful, it has to be successful as a campaign, if it is, they want to celebrate that they want to talk about that internally, it's good for their personal brand, it's good for their professional development and how they're seen among their team.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eBut also they want their colleagues, you know, the sales team who's gonna follow up on leads other colleagues in the marketing department, they want them to know that it was successful. So that was an example of something we found in \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/customer-journey-mapping-a-how-to-guide\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"journey mapping\\\"\\u003ejourney mapping\\u003c\/a\\u003e.

But it's becoming something we're starting to use for employees, co-pilot to help employees get access to information that might be in disparate systems that might be buried, giving suggestions about things to recommend to a customer. So yeah, we're seeing it show up everywhere. The use cases being for now primarily, like, let's augment what the customer is wanting to do anyway, write this post, if it's a member, or write this job description, if it's a customer, help them make it better. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd if it's an employee, help them deliver a better experience, I say for now, because that's sort of like human assist. It's other places, it's popping up where it's a primary interface. And I think as we keep going with AI, it will become more of that where it's AI to customer or AI to AI, the AI on the other side acting on behalf of the customer themselves. But right now, it's a lot of that human assist.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 28:58:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eYou can't write an AI assistant post on LinkedIn without a couple of nice emojis next to it. Like, you know, if this is going to be great for business momentum, you have to have a rocket ship next to it. That's right. That's that's the deal. Sam, you know that this has been great. I'd really like to do a couple more things. One, I'd love for you to just wrap this whole conversation up. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd I think my big takeaway is the moment with that gentleman in the global call center. Yeah, and to me, that's a heck of an illustration of employee experience meets customer experience where you're using analytics, you using qualitative, you're using one to one face to face it's just like everything is involved in that so what would be your big takeaway from this Sam you know, talking to a fellow CX leader in your shoes that really wants to do more of this combination of EX and CX because I think that's the gold star this Convo for me. Yeah.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSam Stern 29:50:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eSo go into those efforts to understand and learn to find parts of the experience to fix. Go in with humility. It's been easy for us. LinkedIn is a big organization. So we're like, well, we don't really understand how this works. And embrace that mindset. I don't understand how this works, because then it allows you to explore, it allows you to ask the dumb questions. And we've learned a lot by doing that. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eWhen my colleague asked that gentleman about, what are the studio metrics, she was asking for a position she truly didn't know. How did he balance that? And by asking those questions, you get to deeper insights. And I think that's a really valuable mindset to embrace for CX professionals is, if you are in a position where you don't know a lot about what's happening, great. Embrace your ignorance, if you feel like you know, really try and dial back and think what am I assuming is true, or what might be different from the last time we did this research, because that allows you to uncover new insights, new perspectives, nuances to your understanding that maybe you hadn't explored yet. And that's where we get into these opportunities to make real \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/current-state-of-digital-customer-experience-in-2024\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"unique experiences\\\"\\u003eunique experiences\\u003c\/a\\u003e or real upgrades to the experience that we might have missed if we hadn't embraced that mindset.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro 30:56:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eLove it.

All right, that's a good start, Sri. Sri, you know, I think a lot of our listeners, customer experience, leaders are always fascinated to know how the team lines up within your organization, where you sit, who's around you, that kind of thing. So I would love to know who we're talking about, you know, how many people are involved here? And what are the primary objectives of your team?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNarasimhan: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eI'll start with a little bit of a vision for CVS. You know, Karen Lynch, when she took the job said that she wanted to be the most consumer centric company in healthcare. And around that she actually brought in a chief customer officer, Michelle Peluso to really ignite and drive that vision. So my organization as the head of enterprise customer experience sits in a central role within the organization and spans all of our different business units. So retail Aetna, Caremark, healthcare delivery, we cover it all. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd what I have in terms of structure is I have a group that's focused on measurements to making sure we take all the data, we get 17 million pieces of feedback, just from surveys around the company, all the social media data we get and other data that we would collect internally and making sure we drive action on it. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd then a big function I have is around what I call change management and strategy.

It's almost like becoming a core KPI or a core principle of customer experience is delivering great employee experience. And the CX people are the ones to do that. Because they have the data. They're good at data. They're good at analyzing data and making actionable outcomes out of it plans, KPIs, how much of your job would you say is employee experience?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNarasimhan: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, you know, it's a great point, even if you walk into a store, and there's a positive energy in the store, and you can see the employees are happy being with each other, you feel that as a consumer, and you want to be there, you want to be a part of that experience. And I always say that no one walks into their job saying they want to do a bad job, right? \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eThere's a ton of positive intent, you always have a why, for why you join an organization. And it's our job as leaders to help unlock that why, move the obstacles out of the way, so that you're really able to live that and deliver the best in class experience that I'm sure you wake up every day wanting to do and particularly for an organization like CVS Health, we're managing people's healthcare, this is an awesome opportunity to impact someone's life. And I think what we really focus on is creating the mindset where you're saying, I can't wait to help this consumer, I can't wait to help this patient versus Oh, man, this is another inbound call. So it's a huge part. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd one of the big things we've done culturally is really embedded, what I'd call \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/understand-serve-listen-building-your-house-of-the-customer\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"service standards\\\"\\u003eservice standards\\u003c\/a\\u003e. And the focus has really been on things that everyone would know to do. But it's one of those things where if you reinforce and focus on it, you can create this environment and it becomes a part of your DNA. So I'd say a large portion of what we do is really trying to drive frontline engagement, frontline learning, but also this cultural aspect where we put the consumer at the center and really unlock the potential of those frontline employees through activities like service standards recognition, and making sure that we create a culture where you just can't wait to talk to the member or the patient.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/3-ways-to-improve-ex-and-cx-at-the-same-time\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"3 Ways to Improve EX and CX at the Same Time\\\"\\u003e3 Ways to Improve EX and CX at the Same Time\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEmpowering Frontline With Service Standards\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, that service standards concept is fascinating because it sounds like it's empowering the frontline to always have something to be measured by like, Hey, look at this example, that was part of X service standard, or Y service standard. Do you have any examples of what some of the service standards are?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNarasimhan:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Well, there's a couple of different ways we approach it. One is just as an example, making sure that when someone walks in to our store, or calls into one of our call centers, that we always provide a warm greeting. And I know that seems simple. And you probably hear that all the time. But it does change the whole tenor of the call or the interaction, when you come up with that warm greeting. Now, everyone knows to do that. But it's one of those things where it doesn't hurt to reinforce because if you think about it, you have to be intentional about these things. And you have to actually say like, Hey, this is something that's important that we do every time. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eYou know, it's not necessarily something we want to create, like a stick around. So, you know, it's not like something we measure formally. But as we start training and practicing and embedding, you start seeing that become a core part of what people do. The other thing that I think is really important is we take a lot of pride in \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/the-holistic-equation-why-hx-cx-ex\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"creating engagement between the consumer and our frontline employees\\\"\\u003ecreating engagement between the consumer and our frontline employees\\u003c\/a\\u003e. So through activities like closing the loop, we want to create a dialogue where you're learning and getting better in real time. So I think a lot of the best CX organizations do this, but we free the data, we get as much of that information to the frontline employee. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo they can learn, they can get better, they can adapt as they go. And it creates this sense of because you're seeing the feedback in real time. It creates this culture of wanting to deliver that great experience because you can see the result. And one of the things that we have that's I think tremendous is videos. And you'll see some of these videos, particularly from our specialty patients, where it's emotional, these are really complex conditions. These are complex situations that these patients are in, and our reps are helping them navigate that. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd just the way you hear the patient talk about the interaction with a rep is meaningful to someone like me, it wasn't even involved in the interaction. Now imagine if you're that rep and you're able to see the impact you have. It creates this positive cycle that perpetuates this feeling of wanting to be a part of that patient's life and wanting to really be a partner with them and healthcare, which is what we're driving towards.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/what-defines-world-class-customer-service-now-and-how-to-get-there\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"What Defines World-Class Customer Service Now and How to Get There\\\"\\u003eWhat Defines World-Class Customer Service Now and How to Get There\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eFrontline Employees Are Key to Brand and Service Excellence\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/the-secret-for-any-customer-experience-strategy-listen-to-frontline-employees\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"the front line and customer interaction\\\"\\u003ethe front line and customer interaction\\u003c\/a\\u003e is like the most important thing that happens in a company's day, isn't it? It's like more important than any board meeting. No offense to your team, Sri. Anything you guys are talking about on a Zoom or a board meeting, empowering those frontline agents? Is everything like what level do you take that because it can be a thankless job sometimes because the consumer is having a frustrating day, like you said, it's emotional, health care, very sensitive.

And in many ways they carry the weight of the organization. Those individual interactions, millions of them that occur, to your point are, what develop and what create your brand and what create how you're considered and thought of as a company. So making sure those people are equipped again to tap into their why to tap into their positive intent. Because there's some of the best people we have organizationally, the more we can equip them and get those blockers out of the way, get those issues out of the way that prevent them from achieving and serving our customers in the best way, the better off we'll be.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/the-best-cx-lessons-from-real-customer-conversations\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"The Best CX Lessons From Real Customer Conversations\\\"\\u003eThe Best CX Lessons From Real Customer Conversations\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eStrategic Integration of Consumer Centricity at CVS\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYou have to build consumer centricity and you have to live behind that promise.

Just kidding. But that is actually we've been more so than any other organization I've been a part of taking a very intentional approach to trying to \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/customer-centric-strategy-winning-big-with-compromise\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"drive consumer centricity\\\"\\u003edrive consumer centricity\\u003c\/a\\u003e. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd I'd say there's really four things, we're focused on one, do we have a consistent view and \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/20-customer-experience-metrics-critical-for-your-business\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"measurement of the consumer experience\\\"\\u003emeasurement of the consumer experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e across all the various touchpoints that we have? And as we came in the organization, that's one of the first things we did we said, hey, can we move to a consistent platform, a consistent way to measure. \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/what-is-the-net-promoter-score\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"We chose NPS as our measurement.\\\"\\u003eWe chose NPS as our measurement.\\u003c\/a\\u003e I mean, you can choose whatever I think is most meaningful to you. The reason we picked NPS is we felt like it was a higher standard than say, you know, any other transactional metrics, but we use other metrics too. And data to make sure we have a clearer picture of what the consumer is experiencing.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSecond, we want to, as we talked about already, drive that action at the front line. So \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/analytics\/data-democratization-is-key-for-businesses-navigating-covid-19\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"democratize the data\\\"\\u003edemocratize the data\\u003c\/a\\u003e as much as possible to make sure that all of our frontline employees, corporate employees, everyone has access to what the consumer is feeling and what the consumer is seeing. So that we can make really meaningful change, coach at the frontline, learn at the frontline, but also from all of our employees across the organization, embed the consumer in what we're doing.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe third part I think, is really solving pervasive or systemic issues. Across the organization, we've got partners that we've built and developed, we have what we're calling out, it's a dirty word sometimes in corporate America, but SteerCos where we have actually brought these are the primary issues consumers are facing, what are we going to do to address it, and making sure that we have plans and there's been 100 plus initiatives across the organization where we are actually going to take on and address consumer feedback and make sure that we're taking care of all the systemic roadblocks that are in the way, process issues, etc, that we come across. The way I like to say it, Dom, is consumers are the best mirror. If you're looking in the mirror, and you're looking for ways to get better, there's no better place to live than a consumer and their feedback. So we've really embraced that.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd then the fourth part is \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/is-your-culture-creating-a-great-customer-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"cultural\\\"\\u003ecultural\\u003c\/a\\u003e. So building a culture of recognition, not just talking about the problem, so many organizations just focus on the problems. I think it's the way we're all wired. We're making sure that when we deliver great experiences, we're telling the agents or the store employees, great job, amazing, we create that culture where they want to do that, they want to feed that. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd then also just making sure that, like you said, when we think about culture, putting the colleague and the consumer together, and creating that interplay and that interaction that's meaningful, so that, again, you build that virtuous cycle. So we've taken a really deliberate approach. I think we've had pretty good success so far, obviously more to do. But if you're going to approach consumer centricity, you mentioned it right up front. It's a complex problem. It's something everyone talks about, you better have a real formal definition and a real formal plan. I think we've done that. And excited to see as we continue on that journey.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/leadership\/how-to-build-a-thriving-company-culture\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"How to Build a Thriving Company Culture\\\"\\u003eHow to Build a Thriving Company Culture\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eUnveiling the Reality of Customer Experience\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eWell said, you know, and those four pillars, I want to go into that first one, data and analyzing that data, collecting it and making sense of it. Because I think a lot of times when you look at customers, if you've probably searched customer experience images, right on Google, you're gonna come up with a smiling front desk person and shaking hands, right? Here's the reality of what customer centricity and customer experience is, you're looking at data all day, right? And trying to figure out what your consumers are telling you through that data. So I want to ask you, the tools that your team deploys, like, what are some of the tools that you're using into you don't have to, you don't have to name the vendor name, but like, just the general concept of the tool? Is there like a central data repository that you're looking at? Or is it a little disparate? That's the reality, and you just kind of have to combine these tools and try to make them integrate and work together?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNarasimhan:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e First of all, I'll tell you, my parents are both scientists. And when I told them, I work in customer experience, you're totally right. I think they imagined me as one of those stock images of calling customers on the phone. But you're right, it's a very data centric role. And data is really critical to everything we do. So we use a single survey platform to send and receive feedback, right, we are on the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/medallia-experience-24-conference-introduces-new-ai-supported-cx\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Medallia\\\"\\u003eMedallia\\u003c\/a\\u003e platform. One thing that we thought was critical is to make sure that we standardize that across the enterprise. And one of the key things I'd say is that the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/conquering-the-customer-feedback-gap\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"act of soliciting feedback\\\"\\u003eact of soliciting feedback\\u003c\/a\\u003e is in and of itself an interaction. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd you want to make sure you're doing that consistently because consumers know, increasingly that Caremark CVS, Aetna are the same company. And so we want to make sure that we have a consistent approach, both in terms of the look, feel and how we send the survey, but also in terms of the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2023\/07\/to-get-better-customer-data-build-feedback-loops-into-your-products\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"data we're collecting\\\"\\u003edata we're collecting\\u003c\/a\\u003e, so that we're able to really understand the touch points across our consumer base consistently. So that's just a survey feedback. And like I said, we receive as an inbound receiver on 17 million \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesbusinesscouncil\/2023\/06\/30\/the-power-of-customer-feedback\/?sh=392fa4c64c55\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"pieces of feedback \\\"\\u003epieces of feedback \\u003c\/a\\u003eannually. So huge survey program that we run and operate. One of the key things we do off that survey program too that I think is a really critical components closing the loop. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo following up with consumers after they send us a survey, to learn more, the way I describe that, as the people doing those closing interactions are kind of like root cause analysts. A lot of times consumers aren't going to talk in the language uses internally. They're just going to say, X, Y and Z was terrible. Now that's not particularly useful for us. But when we have the agent, look at it, follow up and understand, it'll say, oh, yeah, that was related to this policy, or this procedure that we had and then we can look at those policies and procedures and get better. So we really want to leverage the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/voice-of-the-customer\/cmswires-top-10-voice-of-the-customer-articles-of-2023\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"voice of the customer\\\"\\u003evoice of the customer\\u003c\/a\\u003e through the employee through our closed loop program.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe other things we do we look at lots of data, we're looking at digital session data, call transcripts, social media data, and just SharePoint around desperate data. I think the way this industry is moving is consumers are telling you their experiences empirically, almost to the point where you don't need to ask. So we are moving more and more towards predicting those experiences. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eBecause we know that if X, Y and Z happened, traditionally, you're going to be a detractor. So we can understand that and measure X, Y and Z without even asking you and follow up and get to you without even sending you a survey. So we're increasingly looking at other sources of data to help drive our decision making. And yeah, we do, we pull it all together that platform around our survey feedback is excellent. But where we really find the value is enriching it with all the operational data and information that we have organizationally, so you can really drive change.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOne of the things we do in our call centers, we link NPS satisfaction to call time. And one of the things we saw is that after a certain cut point in our call center, that NPS declined dramatically. So what we did is we actually created a safety net acting on that where the supervisors informed when you hit that cut point. And they'll reach out to the agent and say, Hey, is everything okay? Do you need any help? And the agents love it, because they know now that they've got this net behind them, if they're on a complicated call, and it's just a proactive way to combine data sources and act on it. And driving action is really a critical piece of this, to make sure that we're driving the best experience. So we're doing things like that all the time, to try to make the most of all these sources of information that we're getting from consumers.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/customer-understanding-harmonizing-the-depth-and-breadth-of-research\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Customer Understanding: Harmonizing the Depth and Breadth of Research\\\"\\u003eCustomer Understanding: Harmonizing the Depth and Breadth of Research\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEmployees Are Key to Enhancing Customer Experience\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e And that is an absolutely critical example of \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/cx-and-ex-why-focusing-only-on-cx-is-a-bad-idea\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"employee experience meeting customer experience\\\"\\u003eemployee experience meeting customer experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e, you're literally inside of a call using your customer data to inform your employee that something might not be going right. And you're right involved in the middle of that transaction with the consumer in real time. That's powerful. Like if you can do that. And that means you're walking the walk with employee experience meeting customer experience, to that effect, do you actually tie in things like EPS, right, your Employee Promoter Score, things like that? Is that something your team handles? Or is it more like on an HR side of things?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNarasimhan:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e So we partner with HR, HR runs those survey programs? Well, what we do though, is we leverage that data heavily. And I think you're right, that connection is really critical. And one of the examples I'll share is that, again, both in our \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/contact-center\/16-important-call-center-statistics-to-know-about\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"call center \\\"\\u003ecall center \\u003c\/a\\u003ein our stores, when you see a new consumer interact with a new rep, experiences tend to be poor, when you have a new consumer system and new to Aetna. They're trying to learn, they want to learn about how everything works, and how do they actually access their coverage. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eIf you put them with a new rep, who\u2019s also learning makes sense, right? Those are going to be poor experiences. So can we actually get smart about that and move like a newer rep that we know is probably looking for more information about what they're getting in their plan with someone who's more seasoned, who understands all that nuance. So those are the other things we look at all the time, it's more like also, in addition to the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/unifying-customer-employee-engagement\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"employee engagement \\\"\\u003eemployee engagement \\u003c\/a\\u003edata that you're referencing, the empirical data. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnother quick example, if you look in our stores, stores that have challenges with attrition, typically have a lower NPS. And so what you want to do, because you know, you're moving employees in and out, so you want to look at that as a root cause of the problem. So what can you do to solve that, and we work leadership all the time, because we monitor that to say, hey, like, you know, if we can solve that problem in the store, it will CMPs improve. So taking it a step further beyond just as employee engagement scores, which we work with a ton. We're trying to get also to some of those operational metrics. So again, it becomes more actionable for us as we work with the field.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-workplace\/why-organizations-should-care-about-employee-engagement\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Why Organizations Should Care About Employee Engagement\\\"\\u003eWhy Organizations Should Care About Employee Engagement\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eNet Promoter Score: The Northstar Metric for CX\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, there's a lot of CX leaders out there that obsess over, you know, a couple of metrics, couple of KPIs. It sounds like you guys are doubling down on a lot of these metrics. But is there something that you and your day like every quarter, you really are bearing down laser focusing on one or two or two or three KPIs? Like, is there something that stands out? That really drives a lot of your decision making over these kind of subset KPIs? Like these are the little ones we do care about, but they're not really driving? A lot of? So what I'm getting at is what are the main KPIs for you?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNarasimhan:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, it's a great question. As I mentioned, I'm a pretty data centric guy, came from a family of scientists. If you're asking for me, I use like,\\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/5-cx-kpis-companies-are-improving-with-ai\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\" I use multiple KPIs\\\"\\u003e I use multiple KPIs\\u003c\/a\\u003e. But organizationally, it's important that probably communicate a North Star. Right. I think if you're going to drive this consumer centricity change, picking a Northstar metric is critical and I think a lot of people get caught up in what is that metric. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd frankly, my opinion, Dom, is you pick one that you like, and you stick with it consistently, because that's what you need to rally people around. And for us, that was Net Promoter Score. It's something that again, we felt like the standard was higher, because what's the most common complaint about Net Promoter Score is, you're asking about the brand, not about me, or the experience I delivered. What I often say to people when they get that is, well, don't we all own this brand. We all own it together, right. So it creates a more of a sense of community around the experience and aligns people to the broader challenges. So it's not just like this is the contact center score. This is the store score. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eWhen you're dealing with NPS. It's our score, and you can rally your organization more dramatically to improve experience. So NPS is our North Star. A few of the others, though, that we look at and are increasingly looking at, are things like churn. If we look at our extra care membership and the front store, we're looking at things like the links in terms of utilization and claims and Aetna and Caremark we're looking at metrics around the refill experience. So we try to, I think you're hearing a consistent theme for me. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eWe love the survey metrics, we think they're really important. We're enriching that as much as we possibly can with the consumer metrics that we collect as an organization. Because I think you want to get a balanced scorecard view. So ideally, you have NPS and some of these other critical metrics that link to experience all in one place. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo that you really get a balanced view of what's going on in your organization. So kind of a combination, NPS is our North Star. But we use a lot of the business KPIs as well, especially those that we have discovered that link to NPS adherence is another example, to make sure that we have as much of a view of the consumer holistically as we possibly can.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/net-promoter-score-top-3-impactful-trends\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Net Promoter Score: Top 3 Impactful Trends\\\"\\u003eNet Promoter Score: Top 3 Impactful Trends\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFrontline Agents Transform Challenges Into Positives\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eAll those layers, you talked about baked into what the NPS outcome is.

And those agents, those frontline agents in the call center, they need support, man. Yeah, it's a thankless job sometimes, I mean, I can say it over and over again in this podcast, but no one calls a call center to say, hey, just letting you know, I'm really happy and you're doing a great job.

You know, I've heard people say things like, oh, this employee is a great fit into our culture like, and that sounds like kind of clannish to me, right? Like they are part of our culture. You want people that are unique and different, and bring different aspects to your culture and challenge you a bit. But anyway, like, what does it mean, in terms of consumer experience? And culture? Like how do you how do you guys view that? How do you get there,\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNarasimhan: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYou make a really good point, you don't want to make culture, this box that everyone fits into, right? And I think that, you know, American society, you want diversity, you want people that are bringing different experiences, challenges and skills to the table. For us, I think if you're talking about the culture, we want to build across our entire organization. It's really straightforward to me, it's putting the consumer at the center of everything we do. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd I think what you see is a lot of people think they're doing that, or trying to do that, but maybe need that framework or that sense of what does that actually mean, to help drive that and, you know, I'll give you an example. I see organizations all the time, develop products, and then push that on the consumer, right? You see it constantly. It's like, Hey, I made this product. How do we market it to the consumer? I think what we want to do, and we're trying to do increasingly, is embed that voice of the customer into a lot of those decisions we're making both in terms of our product development or operations, how we approach, you know, our day to day, we want to start with the consumer and then build the process. And some of that's going to take some time to unwind because organizations across the world have always started with the product. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eBut I think like, that's where we're going. It's Hey, like, it's awesome to see across the organization especially our Caremark businesses. You know, I'm just thinking about some of the processes we built, where we actually come to the table and say, like, hey, is this actually the optimal consumer experience? And it's really interesting in some of the recent initiatives I've been in, the first thing people talk about isn't expense reduction, it isn't operational efficiency. When they're talking about these initiatives, the first thing they say is NPS consumer experience. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSecond thing, right, or one A is colleague experience. And that's what we want organizationally, we want the first metric you think about to be the consumer. Because ultimately, I think that's what drives growth. And that's what drives all the things that we want as an organization, all those financial impacts that comes from that. So that's it. I mean, I think it's a complicated question. I think our answer is simple. We want to put the consumer at the front of everything we do.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/the-secret-to-creating-a-customer-focused-culture\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"The Secret to Creating a Customer-Focused Culture\\\"\\u003eThe Secret to Creating a Customer-Focused Culture\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eDeep Dive into Customer Centricity at CVS\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Well, I'm happy, Sri, to be on the advisory board, because I'm a customer too you know, CVS, we go there. And I'll tell you, sometimes you guys don't have those extra peanut butter, Reese's hearts that my wife likes, you know, because I like to put those next to the medicine when I check out. And you got to step up your game with those.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNarasimhan:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e I'm already on the phone, Dom.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eDom Nicastro says, Hey, this has been such a nice deep dive into you know, how you guys operate and how you look at customer centricity. I'd like to just wrap it up with like, you know, your one big takeaway, like someone listening to this saying, hey, you know, this all sounds great. We want to get off the ground doing something like this, something where we have, you know, four or five pillars of customer centricity. And we trickle that down to the frontline, how do we empower our teams to do it? So if you're talking to someone similar in your role, like a chief customer officer, VP of customer experience, you know, what's step one? Where do they get going?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNarasimhan:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e To me? I think it's, I start with intentionality. So start with the vision, what do you want to be? I think that came for us from the top of the organization. And I think that's also really important building alignment from the very senior leadership that you have. I mean, for our, in our case, it's, you know, Karen Lynch, and Michelle Palusa the top top of our org, build that vision. And then I think you have to be intentional about your approach. Consumer centricity is a huge buzzword out there. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd I think buzzwords, if you don't have a really deliberate plan, you often can lose the messaging and lose the focus that you need to actually embed this organizationally. So far. In our case, it was those four pillars I laid out, be consistent about how you measure, democratizing information and data, solve those pervasive issues, and then build up the virtuous cycle through culture recognition, service standards. So I think those are kind of the critical places to start.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eI'd also say I think, another thing for me, big learning for me is being nimble with the organization, particularly in a place like CVS, different parts of the organizations will be at different levels of maturity, as you go through this. So it can't be a one size fits all, for every group you work with. You have to meet them where they are, to some extent, and drive them forward in the way that will be most effective to that organization. So your messaging, the way you talk about the way I talk to retail, might be different in the way I talk to Aetna or Caremark just because they're different organizations, and they listen and respond to different messages. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd then the last piece I'd say that I think hopefully came clear in this is yes, you want to North Star metric 100%, you want to pick one, to rally people around, but you have to be able and willing to use all the disparate sources of information and data that you have coming in. Because I think CX as a discipline is a very data centric discipline. And the way that you actually achieve change is through data based, actionable recommendations. And one of the things we didn't even hit on is even leveraging customer comments and all those unstructured data elements that you bring in, we use heavily use text analytics. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eYou want to make sure that you have a really strong plan to give database recommendations. Because I think often CX gets thought of as kind of soft and squishy. It's not. To me, it's very focused day to day discipline that's really designed to drive operational change. And I'll add one more I know so that was the last one but one more can consumers are the mirror, listen to the consumers, but you can't just listen. Because there's nothing worse than just listening and not doing anything. You got to act. And you got to build the mechanisms and process for action.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Well, Sri thanks for the wrap up. Thanks for letting our listeners and myself into the behind the curtain of how CVS looks at consumer experience and customer centricity. And also, thanks for having a conversation fit for the dinner table with your family of scientists, because it's all about data. And if it was just customer experience and handshakes and smiles, I think we tune out your family pretty fast. So they want numbers and math.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNarasimhan:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Thanks a lot, Dom. I appreciate the time. It's a great conversation.

Jessica, how's it going? Welcome.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJessica Austin Barker:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Thank you for having me today. It's going. It's a day.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eFrom Consulting to Client Experience Leadership\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Love it. Your title and role is right in our wheelhouse at CMSWire. So we can't thank you enough. First of all, I just would love to know a little bit about your background. I'm always fascinated with how people end up in their roles. You know, we've had a lot of customer experience leaders on here who had nothing to do with customer experience when they were in college. But I would love to know where you began and how you evolved into this current role.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Sure, so you know, I began after college and consulting, which I likened to what people do when they're not sure what they want to do. And so it was a great experience for a few years of management consulting. And then I decided it was time to kind of, if you will, go to industry and start doing work with a company. I landed at Intuit, the makers of TurboTax and QuickBooks, and its origin of Quicken etcetera. And I started off actually in marketing, but it only took me about a year in working with all of the product folks to realize that I really loved solving problems. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo I was fortunate back then that one could sort of transition into product management without really having much craft skill at the time, but just learn on the job. So I effectively grew up in product management. And then you know, went on to take larger cross functional roles. But that's how I ended up falling in love with my client experience element.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Nice and give me one fun nonwork fact about you.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eOne fun nonwork fact, let's see. One fun fact is I grew up with just my dad, which was probably a bit unheard of back in the 70s when I was born. So I was raised by a single father who was only 17 at the time. So that definitely has shaped a lot of who I am, and probably some of my experiences in a positive way. So that's probably one really interesting definitely-was-fun-along-the-way-too fact.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow TIAA Elevates Customer Experience\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Awesome. Well, we're in the same decade, by the way of being born. I'm a 70s guy myself and take pride in it, OK?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eExcellent. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e All right, well, tell us about TIAA and your team and your role. I'd like to set the stage there just so our listeners get an idea of what TIAA does, I'm sure a lot of people do. But for those who don't, it\u2019d be great to give the quick overview of the company itself, and then just your role and team to kind of set the stage.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eSure so TIAA is about a 100-year-old company focused in the retirement space. And our legacy company was actually started by Andrew Carnegie years ago to be able to help those who serve others be able to retire with dignity. And so the \\\"T\\\" in \\\"TIAA\\\" is for teacher. We started off serving institutional clients aka higher education universities, and being the retirement plan provider for all of their employees. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so that's still really a large part of who we serve, our higher ed institutions, but also now other nonprofit segments like health care and some different dot orgs in the arts, etc. So our mission is to really help folks retire with dignity, and a secure retirement with a lifetime income paycheck a year and a half ago. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eThasunda Brown Duckett who is our CEO, after coming in had recognized that, you know, we have opportunity in the client experience space. So one of the first things she did was say, Well, hey, one of the opportunities is to hire somebody at my table as a CEO, who's focused and responsible for our client experience in the end. So she created this new role of chief digital and client experience officer. And that is now what I am here to do.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEnhancing Digital Journey, Breaking Channel Silos\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Awesome. So when you came in, what were the initial challenges, like where was the company digitally? What kind of areas did it need growth in? And how did you get that going?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eWhen I joined, certainly the company had started to invest already in digital experience, but admittedly probably a bit behind of where we would have liked to have been. And so I think twofold is really where my focus has been, it is certainly on accelerating the transition to digital experience and both closing gaps but also looking for opportunities to lead and develop new innovation in that space. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eBut in addition was also the other component which is interestingly sort of in my title, which is digital and client experience, meaning we needed end to end stewardship around how we orchestrate the end to end experience, because prior, we were really set up very channel siloed. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd as you can imagine, not new news, if you set up very channel siloed, the customer is going to experience how your organization is organized, and they're gonna feel that. So that's the other big area that my team is now reorienting around is not just focusing on the digital channel itself, but really walking in the horizontal shoes of our clients and being the orchestrators of how the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/seamless-omnichannel-strategy-best-practices-for-customer-engagement\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"omnichannel experience\\\"\\u003eomnichannel experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e comes together.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/your-silos-are-showing-in-your-customer-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Your Silos Are Showing in Your Customer Experience\\\"\\u003eYour Silos Are Showing in Your Customer Experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eOptimizing Omnichannel Experience for Client Engagement\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, what are some of those top channels? You know, because you mentioned, you know, the channel silos is such a good term, because I did an article on kind of like channel forcing, right. Like some companies channel force in digital, some folks to, \u201cHey, go to this page and sign up.\u201d You know, it's, it's all about what the company feels is comfortable. But so in terms of the channels themselves, what are some of the top channels the most active, if you will, for your clients right now, what's the bread and butter here, digitally?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eLet me maybe start off real fast defining what client means to us. Because it's a little different if you think about the different client sets for us in our business, because we are certainly also a B2B company. And because we are retirement plan providers, we work through the companies that hire us to be the provider for their employees. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo from a client perspective, we have a few audiences. One is what we call the plan sponsor, which is, for example, the university themselves. We have what we call the plan consultant, which are really advisory groups that help partner and have fiduciary responsibility working with those plan sponsors of those institutions. And then of course, we have, if you will, the end customer, the participant whose plan, it's their retirement plan that we're actually taking care of. So when you think about the channels ubiquitously, I would say that some of the main ones are, of course, digital, what they're doing online or in the mobile app. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eBut then there's of course, the experiences they have when they contact us to the call centers, whether that's our end user call center, or whether that's more of our B2B Call Center, we in our legacy, still have a fair amount of paper, and some of that is actually regulatory. So there's also the paper channel, then, of course, there's other channels, like marketing, and so what are they receiving outbound from us? So those are some of the most basic channels that when I mentioned sort of our setup before, again, through well intended, you know, teams and experiences, we had a lot of just disjointed lack of cohesion across those. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo for example, if you take the first use experience in our context, which is enrolling in your retirement plan, one of the first things that I asked for when I arrived as hey, can we take a look at the client experience the participant experience for enrolling, I just like to see what that is. And you can imagine it had a lot of opportunity, when you put all the pieces together from all of those different channels, I think you could very quickly see that that had been the orientation, the channel focus and not the horizontal customer experience, if you will.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/implementing-ai-in-omnichannel-strategies-for-seamless-customer-experiences\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Implementing AI in Omnichannel Strategies for Seamless Customer Experiences\\\"\\u003eImplementing AI in Omnichannel Strategies for Seamless Customer Experiences\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBalancing Simplification with Confidence in Services\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, when you're building out those experiences to be better. What kind of qualities are you looking at? Is it mainly like, \u201cHey, this is too slow. This is cumbersome. We're asking a lot of questions in this enrollment and digital circles\\\" like, where are the opportunities there, what do you exactly want to improve?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e So for me, it's an interesting question. Because absolutely, when you think about simplification, which arguably, we all want, I think what we all want is simplification, and whatever it is, the task that we're trying to get completed. So 100%, we're looking to simplify experiences, meaning cutting down time, you're cutting down waste in the cycles in the process. But I'm always very cautious to get hyperfocused on just time and reducing steps because the flip side of the coin, of course, is confidence. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd particularly in our space, when you're making decisions around your retirement and around, ultimately, big money decisions. We have to be really careful to not get myopically focused on time reduction and step reduction at the expense of confidence. So I feel the primary thing that we're really looking to do is drive confidence in helping guide our participants in particular, around the choices that they're making. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eBecause as you know, most people don't have really strong financial acumen and some of the decisions that they may be making here can be a little bit unnerving. So wanting to really ensure that we're creating confidence is, I think, just as important, if not more so than the simplicity and getting sort of focused on time and steps.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/savor-the-sweetness-of-simplicity-reap-the-rewards-of-customer-happiness\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Savor the Sweetness of Simplicity: Reap the Rewards of Customer Happiness\\\"\\u003eSavor the Sweetness of Simplicity: Reap the Rewards of Customer Happiness\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eStreamlining Compliance with Digital Innovations\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah. Being in financial services. I mean, you have to. You mentioned the regulatory mandates for paper. I mean, that just seems like a nightmare. To me, you have to do it. But it seems like a nightmare to me. For someone trying to manage customers on paper. How often do you have to deal with those analog systems, those paper systems, tell me about the cross department collaboration with compliance with legal. Man, if I had to work with legal most days, I don't know what I would do as an editor.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e So there are some things that our operations team, which sits outside of my team, but clearly we partner together. But operationally, there are certainly some compliant paper related things that have to be done to, for example, let you know that we took action on something that you made a choice around. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo there are certain categories of things that we've got to confirm via paper. We also have major decisions, for example, when somebody is nearing retirement, and deciding to take an annuity and really have a lifetime income source where they're getting a paycheck for the rest of their lives. That is an irrevocable decision. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo that's not unlike any other legal contract. You know, there's a paper element that comes with that. So there's certainly things that are, just need to be. But I think there is acknowledgement that we've also had some waste in the cycle, just around overindexing on sending paper, when the user behavior is to never open the envelope and to put it straight in the trash. So that's the type of thing that we're looking to cut out. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eBut more importantly, I'd say, our history was we had just not enabled all of our client experiences digitally yet. So there were many different tasks along the customer journey, if you will, different jobs, that we were still really only providing that ability through calling us and so the journey over the last year has really been a start to close the gap on things that we know customers would like to be able to do themselves. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eWe just weren't fully enabling that. And in particular, on the mobile app. So we've been very focused on closing all of those gaps on the mobile app and getting to where the puck already is, and making sure that for anything people want to do at their fingertips, they're able to do, that they don't need to pick up the phone and call.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/turbocharging-ai-in-customer-experience-for-growth\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Turbocharging AI in Customer Experience for Growth\\\"\\u003eTurbocharging AI in Customer Experience for Growth\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHumanizing Digital Finance with Expert Support\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e How do you humanize that experience for people who are probably not well versed in or educated in finance or retirement? I mean, it's, you know, there's a lot of hand holding there, and they want their hand to be held. That's why they're coming to you.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eAbsolutely. The way that I think about this is necessarily, we will always have a human component. And we could probably sit around and debate that for hours. And maybe some time in my lifetime, that won't be true. But I believe there's portions of what we're doing that someone will want to have the comfort of a human expert, to help advise them, help to make that final decision, whatever that is. And so obviously, if you think about small tasks, like in our context, updating your beneficiary, you know, who do you want money to go to, updating anything that's more PII related, those things people can do on their own. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eBut then if you think about the acumen and people's different levels of comfort, you know, when you're making decisions around investment lineup changes, when you're making decisions around how much to save and contribute to your retirement plan, or when you're making decisions around, ultimately taking what you've saved and turning that into a lifetime income paycheck, which we call annuitization. Those are for many bigger decisions that they don't feel comfortable making on their own, and they don't understand fully the implications of this decisions are making. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo we're certainly working to humanize how we describe that through our content, the language we're using. And that's a big job that my Chief Design Officer has. So we're certainly working towards all of that in the digital context, but also fully aware that there are many things that our participants really do want to have a live conversation around. And I'm happy to share more about how we do that. We have lots of different channels for that in the context that we're in.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/customer-service-chatbots-ai-can-enhance-your-cx\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Customer Service Chatbots: AI Can Enhance Your CX\\\"\\u003eCustomer Service Chatbots: AI Can Enhance Your CX\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEmerging AI Chatbots Enhance FAQ Responses\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, I was gonna say like, you know, we talked about humanizing the experience. And here's a follow up question to that. Do you have an AI Chatbot? In some circles?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eWe do, I would admittedly say it's still in its early stages. So that's not the lead cat yet for us in terms of where we are directing everybody. We've applied it certainly in the sort of FAQ context, so that we've gotten much better answers to questions and more of a classic FAQ sort of search capability. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eBut in terms of AI chatbot, that's something that's still under development. And for us as well, when you think about a lot of what we do, which is giving advice around someone's retirement plan, that's an area that we are very conservative with respect to how we're going to apply AI, because we cannot get that wrong. So we can't allow for there to be sort of the hallucination that can happen, as you know, with some of the models. So that's an area and it's so core to what we do is giving advice, that there are applications for us for AI and then there's areas that we will be very conservatively walking into.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/ai-customer-experience-solutions-using-emerging-technologies\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"AI Customer Experience Solutions: Using Emerging Technologies\\\"\\u003eAI Customer Experience Solutions: Using Emerging Technologies\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eConversing on Multiple Digital Channels\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, Jessica, you were talking about, you know, the fact that you're having these multiple conversations and multiple channels. I\u2019d love some examples of how you're conversing with these clients and prospective clients in these digital channels.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eSo yeah, Dom, we have conversations as you were asking about both digitally. So some of what we're doing just in guiding them through what we do outbound, whether it be with email, but to start the conversation around, for example, I'll just keep focused on advice and making sure that our participants are on track for retirement. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eWe leverage outbound contacting with email, with phone calls. We of course, bring folks in digitally through campaigns and are really focused on actions that they can take to improve their retirement readiness, and then drive them into our authenticated site where we pick up on that conversation, if you will. And that guidance, which largely leads to leading our participants through what we call an advice experience, which you can just think of, in the digital context as some sort of an advice tool. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo it's taking a set of inputs that we know about them, gathering additional inputs, we use a third party advice engine that is independent, to ultimately provide the advice around different saving recommendations, different allocation, recommendations, investment allocation. But as much as we do that, we also work in person with our participants. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so part of our client experience most definitely is a human led assisted engagement. So I'll give some examples of that. If you imagine our participants being employees of universities, let's say, it starts with us being on campus. So we have consultants that are on campus that are working either one to one appointments face to face with someone, or they could be in a group setting, working with a group of employees on campus to help educate them and bring them along on how the plan works. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd general basics around thinking about your retirement and how to plan for that, then, is you imagine different engagements along the way along someone's lifecycle journey. We also have a set of different types of specialists that we use for different elements of how we give advice. And so for example, if someone is getting ready to retire, and they're starting to think about how they're going to have lifetime income and how they're going to draw down different income sources, as I go into retirement, then we have specialized folks who engage our participants on that type of topic around planning, as you're getting ready to enter into retirement and figure out how you're actually going to live off of the different income sources that you have. And then in addition, we do have a wealth business. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so we have wealth advisers that, of course, work with participants both on what we call their in plan assets, but also experiences around bringing their full portfolio together. So those are a few examples of how we're leveraging the assistant channel. And that will tell you, you know, the secret sauce in my mind in the opportunity ahead of us really is how we can further integrate the digital and assisted channels together and how we identify predictively, those who are in the digital channel, who then are reaching a point back to that confidence point that I made, where really they would be better served by talking to one of our experts or human experts, so that we can get folks across the finish line for different jobs that they're trying to do. And largely again, in the advice space, versus having them feel sort of overwhelmed. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd my perspective is, because of this being a topic, you know, retirement and saving and money, that for a lot of people is difficult emotionally, not just in the actual content of it, and the complexity, but just the emotions. I think people are just looking for a reason to abandon the engagement. And so for us to intercept with helping people with the guidance that they need, and not feeling overwhelmed and stuck, you know, in only a digital experience. I think it's something we have to be very aware of.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/what-is-a-contact-center-omnichannel-customer-experience-redefined\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"What Is a Contact Center?

How do you take that knowledge and apply it in some kind of analytic fashion? And like use it to create better experiences like that is such a challenge for so many organizations, there is such good knowledge within the system. But how do you get that knowledge, extract it and really build experiences off of it?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eI love that question. And I think that is squarely in the camp of really activating client obsession. And so to your point, not unlike whether you go deep, deep deep with folks that are on the phone every day and a call center and understanding what they're learning, I think Your point around how we leverage these on campus consultants and even those that are just on the phone, you know, day in day out with our end customer, we are in the middle of really embarking on that, I'll give you an example. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eWhen I was talking earlier about our digital advice experiences, we have, obviously, a way that we drive the experience itself and sort of the inputs and the outputs that are there, etc, etc. But we know that when you really think about personalization, there's so much more that a human is doing to sort of respond to what they're hearing and then shift left shift, right, ask a different next question. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo this is exactly what we are now working to extract and better incorporate into our digital experiences for scale, whether that be through more basic, what I'll call business rules that we can and should put in place with that knowledge, to then of course, how we can take scripting output and leverage AI to make it scale more broadly, and learn and more broad scale. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo that is going to be, I think, a huge unlock for us. Because, as you can imagine, when you think about, for example, advice, implementation, and people taking what we're suggesting, and then actually making those changes, the effectiveness of that, at this moment in time is much, much higher when they're speaking to someone live, a human versus when they're self guided, you know, in our digital properties. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so this is exactly what we are looking to solve and helping give that same confidence and that same level of personalization, to those who are feeling like they want to be more self guided and will gain the confidence along the way as we're able to do that.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/5-tips-for-improving-personalized-customer-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"5 Tips for Improving Personalized Customer Experience\\\"\\u003e5 Tips for Improving Personalized Customer Experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCollaborating for Enhanced Call Center Operations\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, exactly. Looking at that call center, you'd mentioned that a few times that you were specifically in charge of the call center is that like a team effort? Is that like a director of contact center operations kind of role there.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e It\u2019s not part of my remit. So part of my, you know, I don't think I ever mentioned this, but my direct team comprises the craft of design of product management. We also have enterprise analytics, as well as enterprise research. And then I have the advice team. So I do not have the call center directly within my organization, but necessarily, we partner very close with them. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAs you can imagine everything we're doing to try to improve and simplify the customer experience, we oughta see the impact of that, in reducing what we would call regrettable contacts that are just nonvalue add for the person that has to pick up the phone and call and of course, for us to take the call as well. So we're very integrated around those top contact drivers and what we're doing to improve, not just the digital experience, but again, back to the omnichannel experience to reduce confusion that's causing those contacts. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo yeah, the team is a different team. But I will say in my past life at Intuit, I led our call center, which we called customer success for TurboTax. So I'm intimately familiar with leading kind of the operations of a contact center, and more importantly, with the integration with the product teams and how that's ultimately what really drives success.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-experience\/omnichannel-customer-journeys-unlocking-the-future\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Omnichannel Customer Journeys: Unlocking the Future\\\"\\u003eOmnichannel Customer Journeys: Unlocking the Future\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eRevolutionizing Call Centers With AI Integration\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, the call center is such a big area of focus for us, you know, we're doubling down on how call center agent experience is, how \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/ai-in-the-contact-center-an-essential-tool\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"AI is being infused into call center\\\"\\u003eAI is being infused into call center\\u003c\/a\\u003e, \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/what-predictive-analytics-are-and-how-they-can-help-your-business\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"predictive analytics\\\"\\u003epredictive analytics\\u003c\/a\\u003e, just inspiring call center staff to do their jobs, because it's the most thankless job in the world. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eBut it's also like the front and center of the company. I mean, when I think of my cell phone provider, I don't think of their CMO or the CFO, I think of the person I talked to on the phone. And that's my experience with that company. So the call center is really front and center. So I'm sure there's some exciting things going on in the call center. Can you speak to any of that, like any 2024 big level goals, I know you're not directly responsible for the call center. But I would love to hear some initiatives that are going on there.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Absolutely. And I 100% agree with you. I think when you think about people's perspective on sort of a company they trust, often a lot of that is shaped by the experience they have and those moments that they do talk to us via the call center, particularly if those are moments of distress, and they're sort of disproportionately shaping their view of the company. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo yeah, some of the things that we're doing, which I think are a real bright spot and an area that we're definitely out in the market leading using the latest and greatest. We have integrated \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/ai.google\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Google AI\\\"\\u003eGoogle AI\\u003c\/a\\u003e into our contact center capabilities and operations I'll call it so some of the benefits of that. Everything from being able to take contacts and aggregate all of the sentiment aggregate all of the contact types, you know, so that you're no longer in the old world of having to have people read everything and try and figure out what's driving what contacts and then bucketing them and then trying to understand them. So all the basic categorization understanding of sentiment, so we can get all our basic reporting. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eThat's all taken care of, but I think more interestingly, it's allowing things like much more robust\\u0026nbsp;\\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/contact-center\/is-this-the-year-ai-dominates-the-call-center\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"IVRs\\\"\\u003eIVRs\\u003c\/a\\u003e are the automated experiences when you call so that we can appropriately resolve a lot of different contact types without you needing to talk to someone. Google AI is aided in that we're also using it to do things like routing of issues that we find categorizing, and then helping pipe that into how we route directly to our engineers to start to resolve issues. So there's a lot of work underway there, you mentioned the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/contact-center\/the-importance-of-contact-center-agent-well-being\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"agent experience\\\"\\u003eagent experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e as well. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo the classic sort of next best action and how we can help guide and simplify the experience of those that are on the other end of the phone call to make sure that they're much better led and not having to go to the old school way of searching a knowledge base and trying to find the answer the question while the participant sits there in silence, on the other end, waiting for the answer to that question. So all of those fundamentals that I think AI has yielded, and Google AI has been a great lead in the space as what we're applying at TIAA.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/contact-center\/ai-in-contact-centers-championing-your-agents\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"AI in Contact Centers: Championing Your Agents\\\"\\u003eAI in Contact Centers: Championing Your Agents\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEnhancing Customer Satisfaction Beyond Resolution Metrics\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I just think too many times, you know, they \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/contact-center\/ai-in-customer-service-how-to-empower-your-contact-centers\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"measure these call center agents\\\"\\u003emeasure these call center agents\\u003c\/a\\u003e by just resolution, you know, did you resolve it? And how quick did you do it? There's so much more to that, that I think the big measurement should be did the customer or prospect leave feeling? How do they feel, you know, leaving the interaction and they feel satisfied, even if it wasn't resolved right away? They feel like you cared about them, they feel like you are going to resolve it as soon as you can. You know, I think we need more of those metrics. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yep. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Hey, getting back to we were talking about applying that knowledge base of the consultants, the specialist, the wealth advisers, going forward, what are some of those methods? What are some of those methods that you're going to maybe employ to try to do that, because I need to do this too, as an editor, like I talked to so many readers, and writers and authors, consultants, and so much in my brain that I want to apply to how we do things better for our website, and other digital property. So is there any specific method you think that can be employed to really extract that knowledge from those folks that are on the ground?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e So I would say a couple of things that we have underway, and I would always lean on, I mean, first things first, to your point is getting close to those that are close to customers. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so how we just build that's a foundation of building client empathy and understanding. And rather than hypothesizing behind the scenes, really going out and learning from those that are hearing it direct. So first things first is different product teams, depending on the space that they're solving, making sure that they are going and sitting with the appropriate, you know, if it's a field consultant, if it's someone at the institution, if it's groups in the in the call center. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo depending on what the space is, you know, what might be multiple, it might be one, first of all, just sitting with them, and really going deep and listening to that. So we have, for example, certain product teams that do you know what we would call a follow me home, but does follow me to the office with wealth advisers. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so they're sitting there really watching what the wealth advisers are doing, how they're interacting with their client, not only in using the tool, but what they're saying, and then how they're responding. And so really sitting in those sessions to do that observational learning, because that's where you can save the surprise, that's where you find things that you had no idea what's going on, and you never would have thought to ask the question. So I think that is the foundation is making that connection. But that's part of the breaking down of the silos that I was mentioning. So once we have that there's obvious applications and a couple of different directions that we're working on. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eOne is how do we actually take best practices and be able to scale that and help use that to train others who are in their shoes, so other consultants, other advisers and just trying to uplevel? Everybody, I'm sure you're aware, too, that's a space where there is work underway to leverage AI as well to scale all of that. So that's certainly within the future. I think as well, though, is what I mentioned is how do we take all that and then infuse those learnings into how we would literally write the digital script, if you can imagine, how do we translate that into the content that we use the workflow, and the experience, ultimately, that fuels our digital experiences. So we can yield that same level of confidence, that same level of personalization along the way. So it's not easy. But I think that that is the journey that we're on.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/ai-enhanced-contact-center-platforms-for-world-class-customer-service\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"AI-Enhanced Contact Center Platforms for World-Class Customer Service\\\"\\u003eAI-Enhanced Contact Center Platforms for World-Class Customer Service\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAiming for Delight in Client Experience Transformation\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u0026nbsp;Well, Jessica, you've been so gracious to let us into your organization and give us the behind the scenes of how client experience works in a digital sense. And in a nondigital sense. I got one final question to wrap things up. Maybe two. It's 2024 December, so a year from now, at the time of this recording. What would you have liked to have accomplished by then in the next 12 months when it comes to digital customer experience? What's that big fish that we're going to talk about in 12 months? We're going to do it we're gonna do it on CMSWire we're going to revisit, we're going to do it I promise, but you got to get it done first. So what is it?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u0026nbsp;For me, probably what it would feel and sound like is that back to the clients we have, we've got participants plan sponsors, plan consultants 12 months from now, I want them to be saying to us, wow, it is a new day at TIAA what we're seeing in terms of experience advancement, both in sort of the fundamentals of core jobs, but also in areas that are delightful. So not only are we addressing transactional things that might be difficult, but starting to evoke that positive emotion, that delight, that is what will warm my heart and what I hope for in 12 months may be aggressive and of 2024, that for me, that is really ultimately what I hope to hear and feel, and that they are seeing the evidence of, as we're working on this journey to really transform our client experiences.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Awesome. And one final question is just are there any ways our listeners can continue to follow your thoughts, any suggestions, whether it's just LinkedIn or some posts you make or any other funding initiatives that they can be on the lookout for? I\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAustin Barker: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eI would say probably start with \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jessica-austin-barker-7079a75\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"LinkedIn\\\"\\u003eLinkedIn\\u003c\/a\\u003e, it'll definitely be one spot to follow and also opportunity to see if I'm speaking at any other upcoming engagements. I always communicate that there. So that would probably be the best way particularly since TIAA is not a public company, and so not out there in some of those realms publishing things.

And the next thing I know it's Thanksgiving week. And here I am saying how am I going to stop on the side of the road and do this podcast. And so I have a very good friend shout out to my buddy Mike Riddle, who is the mayor of Charlotte basically in the golf business. And I am sitting at Highlands Golf Course outside of Charlotte, in a very little office with a bunch of strangers who are becoming my friends pretty quickly doing a podcast and my family is sitting in the grill right now waiting for me to do the podcast so they can go have a good time with their cousins.

Well, listen, let's get into it. So I want to know, first just kind of how you arrived in your role, your background. I'm fascinated by backgrounds because a lot of experience officers, Hey, what did you go to college for? Oh, to be a chief experience officer, you know, that doesn't really map out like that. So I'd love to know the background quickly and how you arrived in your current role?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, so I am a born and raised golfer. Basically, my dad came to America in 1973, falls in love with Tom Watson. Obviously India has no idea what golf is. And my dad's chasing the little white ball around the golf course. Here comes his son, I start playing golf. I played through high school. I played in college over at Rutgers in New Jersey. And just like everybody else in the world, if you think you can break 75 You think you're gonna be the next at the time. You know, Greg Norman, there was no Tiger Woods at the time. I graduated college, I moved to Florida, I thought I was going to be the next like I said, Greg Norman, and I realized that you can't so I was a cart attendant man, I started as a cart attendant. I was a caddy when I was 13. I have all golf jobs in my experience background. And I was super lucky just in life in general. But super lucky that, man, I got my first keys to a golf course, at the age of 25 to be the GM. I was not the right person for the job. But somebody obviously thought I was. Fast forward a few years, you know, I've run several clubs, I end up working for the company I do now, Bobby Jones Links. I've been there for 18 years. I started when I was 29, I had a whole lot more hair. I'm 48. Now, and I'll tell you the reason why I'm in this position is we actually changed the name of the company. When I started with the company, we had five clubs, and we were called Affiniti Golf Partners, and that we're now Bobby Jones Links. And we became Bobby Jones Links. Because long story short, the family of Bobby Jones, the golfer, allowed us to license the name. And so when they allowed us to license the name, we were just one of three licensees. It's us, it's the clothing apparel company. And it's the whiskey distributor. And when we became the name, we're just like Club Corporate, Troon or any of those other companies, obviously a little more boutique because we're smaller. And when we changed the name, we said, what are we going to do different than everybody else, everybody else tells you, we're going to raise your revenues, we're going to cut your expenses, we're going to make your greens the best we're going to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut where the real lip service comes into is, we're going to take care of the employees better, and we're going to take care of the guests better. And at the end of the day, we said we're going to drive your bottom line Mr. Client through customer service. And customer service begins with employee culture and then involves obviously the guest culture. And so when we changed the name at the time, I was a regional manager. So I had like 10 properties or 11 properties that I helped oversee. And I raised my hand and I said guys, if we're real only going to make a run for this border. Right? Then we need a dedicated person who can kind of speak the speak and figure out the systems in the operation. And my two owners, Steve Willie and Whitney Krause, they anointed me this position, and we're off and running. So that's my story. But man, I dig the golf business. I dig people. And I just dig hospitality in general, I'm always in awe of how hotels and airlines and cruises and all those people do it. And we're just trying to bring that in the golf world, because it's missing in the golf world.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/strategies-to-balance-customer-experience-and-employee-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Strategies to Balance Customer Experience and Employee Experience\\\"\\u003eStrategies to Balance Customer Experience and Employee Experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003ePrioritizing Employee Experience\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e We have so much in common because I'm a golfer too.

But I would almost tell you that I spend more of my time on the employee side than I do on the customer side. And the reason I say that is because there's different layers of the platform that we kind of operate within the company. But the first platform is really what we would call our core purpose, which our core purpose for a company is to make a difference. It's got nothing to do with golf, it's got everything to do with using your head and your heart to make people happy, right. And so when you have a purpose, like make a difference, the most important thing you can possibly do is bring people into the organization that are aligned with you.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd if you bring people in the organization that are just here to collect the check, punch and punch out, you're never going to be able to make a difference, right? So we have a platform that we put together, basically, really vets the people that come through, we do a really heavy form of training, not so much how to clean a golf cart and how to make a hamburger, we do that kind of stuff. But how do you deliver the hamburger to the table? Right? How do you run out to the parking lot? And grab somebody's bag and really make them feel welcome? Right? I think too much in the golf world. The price of golf has always been how good are the greens, or how good of a condition is it going to be? And what we've learned is the golf course product, it's obviously super important, but how you make people feel, and how they are is what actually pushes the bottom line, right? If we can make people feel really welcome, and make them feel really taken care of in a golf business. That really starts with the people that are working the front line. So that's why when you ask me, Do I spend more time on the\\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/the-holistic-equation-why-hx-cx-ex\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\" CX or the EX\\\"\\u003e CX or the EX\\u003c\/a\\u003e, man that EX is the heaviest part of our whole platform?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/unifying-customer-employee-engagement\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Unifying Customer \\u0026amp;amp; Employee Engagement\\\"\\u003eUnifying Customer \\u0026amp; Employee Engagement\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEnhancing Employee Experience at Bobby Jones Links\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I want to level set dial back just a tad. Because I want our listeners to be extremely aware of what Bobby Jones Links does give me the typical client scenario, like walk me through the challenge that a prospect has. And then at the end of the day, what your company typically does for them.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, so our clients range anywhere from home builders, home builder says, I want to build homes on a golf course. Man, I'm so good at building homes, but I have no idea how to run a country club. But they realized that the country club is what's going to make the appraisal value of the homes go up, they can sell the home for more dollars, etc, etc. They call a company like us and say, Hey, Bobby Jones, will you run the entire neighborhood for us. So you're talking about golf, tennis, fitness, swim, accounting, human resources, the whole nine yards. So we have a lot of home builders, we have some individual clients that you know, dad on the golf course. Unfortunately, dad passes away, the next generation gets the golf course. And they say, I don't want to run this club. But the club does financially fairly well. They hire someone like us to do that. We get a lot of like I said, developers, independent owners, we get a lot of private clubs, where you look at the board. And it's like two lawyers, two doctors, three engineers, a guy who owns a subway and a librarian, and they're trying to run a country club. And they don't know how so they hire us to do that. So the actual scope of work, Dom, starts with the employees and human resources, creating the financials, running the day to day operations, which is really golf, tennis, fitness, swim, like the nuts and bolts of what you get. And then obviously on the back end of that is capital improvements, where are we going in the future, etc, etc. So we're really partners with whoever our clients are.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/why-its-time-to-embrace-employee-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Why It\u2019s Time to Embrace Employee Experience\\u0026amp;nbsp;\\\"\\u003eWhy It\u2019s Time to Embrace Employee Experience\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEmployee Experience Key in Merging Cultures\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e So when you're trying to get some great customer experience outcomes, some great employee experience outcomes. Are you talking about that from the standpoint of your clients and their employees or are you super focused on Bobby Jones Links employees as well?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Well, it's one of the same. So what happens is when we get called to be a management company, we actually take on all the employees. They all fall into our bucket, right. So what they do is their, quote, unquote, DNA is basically our DNA. So we teach them, the values, the service standards, etc, etc, of our company. And that's what we bring to the actual country clubs. So a lot of times, it can be a little bit difficult because you're used to one thing. And what we do is bring in something a little bit different. So there is a little bit of a transition that happens between, hey, I'm just here to deliver hamburgers to saying, hey, now I'm here to deliver hamburgers with a smile with a lot of curiosity, etc, etc. You know, so we do we take on all the employees.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/is-it-time-to-combine-customer-experience-and-employee-experience-programs\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Is It Time to Combine Customer Experience and Employee Experience Programs?\\\"\\u003eIs It Time to Combine Customer Experience and Employee Experience Programs?\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBalancing EX-CX Framework in Company Culture\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah. And it all comes back to a \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/cx-and-ex-how-to-rox-your-metrics\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"CX-EX framework\\\"\\u003eCX-EX framework\\u003c\/a\\u003e, which we think a lot of companies say they have that or want to have that. And they're just not quite there. So, you know, the last guest we had on the show was actually in her title, it was customer experience and employee experience officer. So she was literally walking the walk on that last episode. So tell us about how you see a strong CX-EX framework developing, working and actually following through on those promises to combine both?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eSure. So like I said, if I was to walk you through a very simple, let's say, tomorrow, you hired us and said, OK, Gautam, we want you to run our club, the first thing we do is we get with all the employees, and we immediately jump into the actual culture of our company, which like I said, is making a difference, right, and we get in there. And we kind of tell them who Bobby Jones is. We tell them what the man stood for. We talk to them about our company. And we dive in there and we start explaining to them what customer service is all about. Right?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo we explained to them customer service. Now, that ties into the EX side, because we want to make sure that what we're doing with them is that we're onboarding them correctly. The orientation process is done with a lot of care and concern, we have a lot of different programs that we put into place for employees. But really, it starts with just a mindset change that, hey, I'm here to service my fellow coworkers. And I'm here to service the guests that walk through here. And the other side that we really hone in on is how do you take a $4, $5, $18 and $8, whatever the number is a dollar an hour person and actually give them purpose. So we have all these people, they look up at us in these orientations. I'm like, Yeah, you guys are just like everybody else. But when you start telling them what their true purpose is, right, whether they're here for a day, or they're here for the rest of their lives, you actually have a true purpose in the hospitality business, you start seeing that mindset change, right, which is really the EX side of the business, the employee experience. And then we start sprinkling all the different things that we do, like, I know, we'll talk about that later. But we have a real cool program called Freedom 15. And Freedom 15 means is that any department head in the club can tap any employee on the shoulder, and they get 15 minutes to go make somebody's day.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIt could be bringing somebody cookies, it could be taking out cold bottled water on a hot day, it can be giving out mango scented towels to the customers that are golfing, it could be doing whatever they want, right? So you're taking this frontline team, and you're making them front and center in the actual customer experience now. But that's an experience for the employee too, right, because they've never been told, you're allowed to give away a beer to somebody, it's always about how dare you give the beer away. You're costing us money, we don't trust you. So we incorporate things like trust. I hate the word empowerment, but I'm going to use it. We really like to use word freedom, we start talking about communication and motivation for these frontline teams so that EX is super important.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOnce you solve the EX side, which is really for this frontline staff understanding that, hey, this is the culture of the company. This is what I'm trying to accomplish. I'm starting to feel valued. The next part about it, which is probably a little bit different than what you may hear from other guests on the show is because, Dom, we're not Home Depot or every Home Depot looks the same. Every McDonald's looks the same. Every Chick Fil A looks the same. Every one of our clients is different. We have private clubs, public clubs, clubs that charge $25 and clubs that charge $200. So what we do is we actually take the DNA of the club, and we start building customer systems or CX systems off of the DNA of the club. So if you and I said, Hey, Gautam, let's go play golf at a $100 golf course. You and I walk in there and the stuff that I'm going to work on, Dom, is going to be, we're grabbing bags in the parking lot. We're going to bring beer on a tray with a napkin serve from there right, right. So we build different CX experiences at each club based on the club's DNA. And that's what we train the frontline team to do. And then we sprinkle in all those fancy little, what some people call surprise and delight moments. And that's \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/the-art-of-balancing-employee-experience-and-customer-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"where the EX and the CX combine\\\"\\u003ewhere the EX and the CX combine\\u003c\/a\\u003e.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/ai-in-customer-experience-and-employee-experience-finding-balance\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"AI in Customer Experience and Employee Experience: Finding Balance\\\"\\u003eAI in Customer Experience and Employee Experience: Finding Balance\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eMeasuring Success in Employee Experience\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eWonderful how you explain that because, at some point, you're going to have to measure that to the success. I mean, I think it's easier, it seems easier anyway, to measure things in the CX world, you've got sales, you've got surveys, maybe, customer experience, anecdotes, just walking around the courses and talking to people you can measure. And by the way, customers will tell you how they feel.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eAbsolutely. Oh, yes.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYou can measure it with that data, employee surveys and data, though that's hard to come by. Right. It seems hard to come by anyway, like, employees are quiet. They're reserved. I mean, I don't want to say that I might get in trouble. So when you're trying to build that frontline experience, for the employees, for the staff, how do you at the end of the day measure that?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Well, there's a couple of ways that we do it, actually. So when you first join the company, you go through a pretty good orientation process, it's a weird word, but orientation, right? And we've got this, you get your name tag, you get your uniform, you get this little Tervis tumbler like you get all this cool swag, right? And you're like, Yeah, I'm Bobby Jones, and I'm this. But ultimately, what the onboarding process for us is, we actually do a cultural onboarding, which basically what we say is, you're being onboarded, you work for Bobby Jones, but you work at this property, right? So it's an interesting way of doing things.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAfter that onboarding program goes through, we actually reach out to all the new employees, we, I shouldn't say all we probably reach out to, I would say a large majority of them through a program that we actually run through the office, and we just call you, and we say, hey, Dom, how's your experience going at your club? And you say, ah so far, so good, or maybe not great? And we'll say, Hey, did you by the way, did you go through the orientation? Yes, I did. What did you learn? I learned this? Are you making friends? Right? Are you feeling like you're doing work that's got some real meaning behind it.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo we do quite a bit of just phone calls and kind of reaching out now. We don't reach out. It's not me, it's typically somebody from our human resources department that does it. And you'll be surprised how honest people are when you get these kinds of calls. So we definitely measure employee satisfaction very early on in the\\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/successful-customer-onboarding-a-quick-guide\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\" onboarding process\\\"\\u003e onboarding process\\u003c\/a\\u003e, right off the bat, we get you within a couple of weeks, and it's like, Hey, how are things going? Right? We do a lot of that.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe other thing we do is we do have a survey that we send out, the survey\u2019s OK, and I never feel like surveys are the greatest things. But I can tell you, Dom, probably the best thing we do is at all of our general managers and department heads, they get a really good feel of how people are doing because of the programs that we put into place. You know, they're constantly asking how people are. But I would say the number one answer to your question is the reduction in turnover, when you start seeing employees that leave for the summer, because they're going back to school, but they want to come back, when you start seeing department head turnover, which are your key leaders not turning as often as they used to. That's a showing that the culture is breaking through. The purpose is breaking through that EX is really strong. So our turnover rate has really reduced itself after we introduced this program several years ago.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/whats-love-got-to-do-with-customer-and-employee-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"What's Love Got to Do With Customer and Employee Experience?\\\"\\u003eWhat's Love Got to Do With Customer and Employee Experience?\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.businessnewsdaily.com\/7010-employee-feedback.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Employee Feedback\\\"\\u003eEmployee Feedback\\u003c\/a\\u003e Spurs Meaningful Changes\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah so a lot of its \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-workplace\/6-employee-retention-strategies-for-your-organization-to-consider\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"employee retention is a metric\\\"\\u003eemployee retention is a metric\\u003c\/a\\u003e you guys feel that's very important, which makes sense to me.

And I give you this example because it hits home to me every time I even tell the story. I promise I won't be crying, but it's a pretty good one. So we were doing some work at a club in Nisswa, Minnesota, which is so far north, it's summer for like two weeks out of the year. That's all fine. But it's a resort. It's the biggest resort in all of Minnesota, believe it or not. It's called Grand View Resort, Grand View Spa and Resort. And we were doing consulting work up there and they have four or five restaurants. They've got two golf courses. They've got a spa, they've got a little chocolate shop. They've got a hotel, they've got two hotels, actually. They've got timeshares the whole nine yards, right. So I'm up there and we're talking about CX and we're talking about EX and we're building these systems for every single department to be able to improve their customer service. And one of the last rounds I had was literally with the property group. So these are the guys that are picking up trash. These are the people that are cleaning the bathrooms in the common areas.

As far as like when you hear the applause. It's typically for the people that come in contact with the guests, right? That's where you get the applause when you go back home, and you had a great time. You're like, Oh, my waitress, Judy did a great job. And she was the greatest server ever, right? No one's ever saying, I use the restroom, or I went to the beach, I didn't do all those things, right. So I'm sitting in this room, and there's about 50 of them. And we're talking about all these different things, and one guy just raises his hand and goes, Gautam, I'll tell you what you can do for me. I want a book of maps, so that when I see people getting lost, I can walk up to them, hand them a map and say, Here's how you get to where you get. And he goes, I would love to have just a bag of lollipops or something. He goes, I see these kids all day long. And I'd love to be able to just make somebody's day. And I was like, this is brilliant, because this is what they need to feel valued, right. And when they feel valued, all of that EX value goes directly to the consumer. Because now when little Joey's out there on the skating rink, and he's knocking his hockey puck around. But Pauley, the landscaper comes up and he's like, Hey, guys, here's a couple of lollipops for you to have, have a great rest of your day. The parents are like on cloud nine, right? So I always think of that story, because these are the people you don't think about right? Usually like what can the cart attendant do? Or what can the line cook do? And all of a sudden, it's like, this guy story hit home to me like never before?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eIntrovert Employee Sparks Inspiring Change\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, it's such a good example. And now I feel like I'm on \u201cUndercover Boss\u201d right now. Right? You're the boss, you're talking. Let's seriously though that show, we make fun of it. But it's a great show. It's all about employee experience and customer experience, and how those two worlds mesh for that employee to be passionate about wanting to do more. That's magical, right? Is not just going through the motions picking up trash and cutting grass, they actually want to go above and beyond. That's a great example.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e It was incredible. It was, I'll give you one more if I can real quick. So you know, in our world, just like any world, right? You have introverts, you have extroverts. And the extroverted kids and I say kids, because a lot of our teams are made up of young kids that kind of come and go through their high school and college years. So I always get an opportunity to talk about how do you engage with the guests, right? How do you do it? And I met this kid, he's from Atlanta, I met him and he was like, the most shy kid, the most shy kid you've ever seen in your life, right? And I'm trying to give this kid examples of blah, blah, blah, here's what you do, blah, blah, blah, here's what you do in Disney World, you're on stage. And he's looking at me like, Hey, old man, I don't even know what you're talking about with the stage thing. But I guarantee you, if I put the goofy mask over my head, I'd be way more extroverted. If you gave me something to hide myself, right. So fast forward, about a month later, I see this kid and, Dom, he is killing it out there. I was like, Mikey, what happened?

He took something so small, because he wanted to be engaged with the customer. He figured out a way to do it. He's still an introverted kid. But he figured out how to do that. And I tell that story all the time, like I am today. Because that's all it takes is a little bit of inspiration from somebody and I can spread the word to everybody who's out there introverted or extroverted.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eIt's a big moment for an introvert to engage with another human. Right?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eRevamped CX Approach Boosts Golf Course Appeal\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eAnd for him to want to do that. And use a technique to do that to make him more comfortable. That's pretty cool. That is pretty cool. Let's move to the customer side and talk about an example. They're like, kind of like the same question, where can you illustrate a moment where customer experience was, you know, lacking? And in something data, or experiences or feedback from customers told you something or some of the employees were talking about experience of the customers? The two examples you gave just now kind of like that, too. But a big one where sort of a CX approach was revamped. What was the problem and sort of why was it revamped if you have one of the top you had?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e So we do just like any other company, we do secret shoppers. And what I'll tell you my problem with the secret shopper is, is let's just say you're Dom Nicastro and you're a multi multi millionaire and you come and play one of our golf courses. And the problem a guy like me has with a guy like you sometimes is, I'm never going to reach your expectations because you think everything should be perfect, because that's what you're used to. Right? So a lot of times those guest surveys are a little bit wonky, based on the expectation. I'm not saying they're irrelevant, and they're bad, but that they're a little bit difficult to kind of quantify as far as, I'm never going to reach your elevated level of service desired.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOne of the things we do have in the company is we actually do a guest experience audit. So what that means is it puts us on the employee side, not from a product standpoint, necessarily, but from an experience standpoint, which means when you walked into the golf shop, was the gentleman sitting on a stool? Or was he standing at attention? Right? Did he greet you right away? Or did it take a long time? When you got to the First Tee? Was it a lot of rules? Or was it a lot more like, Guys, you're going to have a great time out here today, when really we look at it from the other side, right. And so when you do an audit like that, Dom, you actually get to see what the guests are experiencing.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd then you can start throwing really cool customer experience things in there. So the example really is something I talked about a little while ago, is these mango scented towels, believe it or not, listen in Florida, it's a million degrees, it's a million degrees outside, right, it's a million degrees, you know, your pricing everything super low. I mean, you got these people that are charging, like 80% off the greens fees. And what you're realizing is, these people will come out on the golf course, if you can figure out a way to cool it down for them. And this simple conversation was literally people walking in wearing white shirts, and they're soaking wet through it, right. And they're like, oh, man, we really wish you had more coolers on the golf course, or more water fountains on the golf course. And you're thinking, OK, how's a better way for me to beat this. And the best way to beat this is by saying, we're gonna have a guy who's going to go around the golf course, and you're gonna see him every three or four holes, and he's gonna give you this cold ice towel that smells like mangos. And when you implement something like that, now, back to the first conversation we had, I guarantee you, because of that experience, I can probably charge you and I'm not the economics guy. But I can probably charge you $2 more for that round of golf, just because I added that experience. And so that feedback was literally a bunch of people we\u2019re watching walk in the golf shop going, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot. And I'm going how do we cool this thing down for people? Here's how we're going to cool it down. We're going to cool it down by doing these towels. Yeah, and all of a sudden, a million more golfers are going to come and play necessarily not. But is that guy going to come back in the summer? Yeah, he is.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eFirst Steps for Effective CX-EX Audits\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah. All right, the wife and kids are in the middle of a road trip. So let's wrap this up. I'm someone let's say I'm a customer experience leader. And I just feel like our employee experience needs work or that audit someone that's in the beginning of an audit phase looking at themselves, or whether it's golf course, whether it's any hospitality, whether it's any business, what's the first couple of steps if they want to do one of these CX-EX audits with the goal of actually building a framework that the two functions actually do work together.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eSo the first thing that we did, and again, my recommendation here is to number one, look at it, take the employee journey first. Put yourself in the shoes of an employee, for X amount of days, whatever that takes. Watch where they park, watch how they walk in, watch how they do their job, because you're going to learn so many things based on what the employees go through on their entire journey. So you're going from orientation to the time that they clock out, what does that even look like? Right?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo once you figure that out, then you flip it and you go, now I'm going to look at it from the customer standpoint, what is the phone call sound like? What is the welcome sound like, what does all of its sound like? And when you start looking at both sides, separately, you figure out ways to make it better, you figure out what it is. I mean, there's literally things, Dom, that I've looked at over the years about just how we train the employees, sometimes how we train the employees used to be really weak, you know, it was really not well done. It was just here's a nametag and a shirt and go follow Peter around. And that doesn't make any sense, right? So really what you got to do, like I said, you start with the employees and build a customer journey for the employees because I think a lot of people in my position focus so heavily on the customer journey for the customer. And they forget about who's actually delivering that experience.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Right.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e So the first thing is employee experience. What does it look like, from orientation to the day they leave? What does that whole experience look like? And then you go on the back end of that and you say, OK, let me follow what the customer goes through. And then you start blending all that stuff together. And then obviously, and this goes without saying but, man, I would say, listening to both parties is extremely important. You could figure out a way to get all the ideas from the customers, a lot of those things, you know, you can't pay for it. It's too expensive, blah, blah, blah. But man, just listening to the employees and the burdens that they have, are going to go a long way. A lot of that listening is part of that, like I said, that employee journey, I absolutely start with employees first, and then I make my way to the customers.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eGolf Industry's Unique Hands-On CX-EX Approach\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, and you're listening journey sounds like it's very hands on, like, it's very one to one calls with employees kind of thing. Do you find yourself in a position ever to have to measure that stuff digitally? Like, on scale, like, OK, we need to send out a massive survey blast and then upload it to our customer data platform, that kind of thing? Or you guys seem like you're truly hands on with each client?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, we're more hands on, I think I should have said this way in the beginning, the golf business is one of the most archaic businesses you'll ever be a part of. Right? I mean, it literally took all the airlines and all the hotels to be able to book online before we were like, OK, I guess we'll do it too. Because we don't know. I mean, again, in our world, it was very different. We're just really in the last, you know, I don't want to say a year or two. But I would say in the last 10 years, we've started to get a little bit more into the technology. You can book online, now you can do all the things, you're starting to see the top golf and all the stuff that's coming out there. But nah, I would say, Dom, right now we do employee surveys, we get data, we kind of break down the data and see how things are going. But like I said, I think we do not have a very strong like, technologically based data capturing of really breaking it down, I would say, we're so into the people. And every club is individual, right? So it makes it a little bit different.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eFrontline Focus in Employee-Customer Experience\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eI totally get that. Well, it's good to hear even our digital customer experience leaders that are listening to this still get a heck of a lot of actionable tips and advice from this talk. So we appreciate you letting us into that world and, and bringing us right onto the golf course really, literally, literally where we stand now. So we're gonna let you go with your wife and kids, get back on that holiday road trip. But before you go, any place you feel like listeners can follow you. Are you doing any sort of blogging or thought leadership or you just kind of chiming in on important experience topics of the day on LinkedIn?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I do some work on LinkedIn. I have this just the minute moment that I do. And it really one of our training platforms is JUST and stands for Jones University Service Training like Bobby Jones, but it was kind of birthed out of the whole man, when you ask people what do they do for a living? They're like, Hey, I'm just a line cook. You know, I'm just this, I'm just that and I'm like, man, you're just the most important people in the whole entire company. You're doing all this heavy lifting, you know?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo I do a video on Mondays. It's nothing crazy. It's just my thoughts. It's random thoughts. And I do, I'm lucky enough to do some podcasts with gentleman like you. I go speak every once in a while at different CX conferences. But Nah, man, I'm far less of a pontificater about this stuff. Because my job is literally building the systems. And one of the parts of my job I love is closing the restaurant down early and literally doing employee training on how do you make the table look, how do you greet the guests? I always take lottery tickets with me, we give out lottery tickets, we make it fun.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut like I said, I'm way more hands on. I'm far from the technology guy, but I dibble dabble here and there. So that's why I dig stuff like this. But I'm a big proponent of the frontline team. I was part of that frontline team for so long and my business 90% of our company is made up of people who make less than $20 an hour.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eSuch a good point.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eDo the math on that right. If 90% of your company is not key leaders, who's the most important person and that's what I love to preach, man, I am all about that dude hustling out there, grabbing bags, slinging beer, giving out hamburgers for eight bucks an hour trying to make it go and those people are so important. So like I said, I'm not a pontificater on that. But I love getting in the trenches with them.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Gautam Patankar. We appreciate you coming on CX Decoded. Very much so and hey, I wouldn't rule out more pontification after people listen to this. I gotta get that guy on my podcast.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGautam:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Right?

I always tell people whenever I get on stuff like this, thanks for taking the chance on a golf guy in a golf company and not somebody from some fancy company that's on the New York Stock Exchange because I think some of us get it too. And we do a lot of that heavy lifting, but I'm thankful for this and appreciate the friendship.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eAll right, you too.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eWe encourage you to drop us a line at \\u003ca href=\\\"mailto:editors@simplermedia.com?subject=CX%20Decoded%20podcast\\\" title=\\\"editors@simplermedia.com\\\"\\u003eeditors@simplermedia.com\\u003c\/a\\u003e And if you have comments or suggestions for a future podcast, we'd love to hear from you.

I hope everyone's doing well today. I sure am with this guest. We're going to be catching up today with April Ho-Nishimura, head of one experience at \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.onsemi.com\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Onsemi\\\"\\u003eOnsemi\\u003c\/a\\u003e, a semiconductor powerhouse. We're going to be chatting today about the intersection of customer and employee experiences, how they can be communicated, implemented effectively within an organization, particularly from the top down, you know, getting really that strategic alignment. But forget about me, let's get to the star of the show. April, how's it going today?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eApril Ho-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Hey, Dom, it's going good. Thanks so much for having me.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBlending CX and EX: Ho-Nishimura's Unique Journey at Onsemi\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Oh, it's a pleasure. And you know, we talked before the recording, and you're walking the walk with customer and employee experience. I mean, literally, you focus on both dynamics and how they can combine for that one experience at your company. I love it. It's a fascinating role to me, you know, April \u2014 because we haven't seen \u2014 we've heard a lot of talk \u2014 let's say that \u2014 about how important it is to bring customer experience and employee experience together. But someone who actually has that in their title, essentially, is a fascinating dynamic to me. So I'd love a little background on how you sort of arrived in this role you are in today like. Did you start in CX? Did you start in EX? Like where were you?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah,so I love that question. What's interesting is, it's probably my whole career path has been in all different areas, right? Kind of culminating into CX. So prior to joining Onsemi, I was the head of digital customer experience in the chemicals industry, and I had an opportunity to come over to semiconductors. And it was really the vision though, that drew me to Onsemi, you know, the vision of our board and our CEO, that employee and customer experience, they go hand in hand. And it was a concept that I believed in, throughout my whole career. But to your point, I never had an opportunity for a company to think that way. So certainly my background is in CX, but I will say that it's all of that experience from CX that paves the way to combine both disciplines. So I think I'm very blessed to be in the role that I am in.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/ai-in-customer-experience-and-employee-experience-finding-balance\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"AI in Customer Experience and Employee Experience: Finding Balance\\\"\\u003eAI in Customer Experience and Employee Experience: Finding Balance\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eOnsemi's 'One Experience' Approach: Uniting CX and EX\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah,I literally have never heard of someone who actually has that role that actually looks at both of them equally. I've heard a lot of CX leaders discussing that they care about how their contact center agents are performing. And are they feeling good about their jobs? So that's employee experience, right? But they never truly connected the two. So at Onsemi, you have that quote, one experience theme, and you literally call it that. So I would love to know, like the origins of that one experience dynamic. And how Onsemi and your teams have arrived at that?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Sure. You know, I think historically, when we think about employee experience, it usually fits in with the HR organization. Right? And I think the reason why it's always been separated is HR usually has this approach, a very legalistic approach, right, that the data is really confidential. You can't share it, for example, turnover metrics, there are people that talk about it. But is it really a taboo subject? And I think the way that we started to approach this is once our leadership team really started to understand from the customer side, where we look at personas, and journey mapping, and then the conversation became well employees go through the same thing.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThere are employee personas. And there are countless studies out there right on the org development side of how to develop employee personas. But it was how do you craft and play personas the right way, so that you can look at employee journeys in the same way that we look at customer journeys? Because at the end of the day, it's about how do we retain our employees? How do we get them to want to be here? And how do we grow them to be their best? And you can only do that by really understanding those touchpoints. So really, it's the same process that we use for CX and being able to parlay that into EX. And it was, once we started having those discussions at the leadership level, that the idea really started to catch on, people saw the vision, and then it made sense.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/the-holistic-equation-why-hx-cx-ex\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"The Holistic Equation: Why HX = CX + EX\\\"\\u003eThe Holistic Equation: Why HX = CX + EX\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEmployee Personas: Beyond Traditional CX Strategies\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e I love the term employee personas, we're so used to saying \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/marketing\/glossary\/customer-personas#:~:text=Customer%20personas%20are%20archetypal%20representations,expectations%2C%20behaviors%20and%20motivation%20factors.\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"customer personas\\\"\\u003ecustomer personas\\u003c\/a\\u003e, customer personas, who are we marketing to? Who are we giving experiences to and to have someone care about employee persona, this is like so awesome. So give me an example of an employee persona. Like I could tell you who the personas are that CMSWire writes to you know, we care about folks like you April pretty much chief customer officers, VP customer experience, so do you have names for these employee personas?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Oh, absolutely. And you know, I will caveat and say, right, there's tons of ways to do employee personas. And, you know, there's a lot of companies that do them by levels, kind of like what you're saying, right? There's the C-suite, there's managers, there's needed frontline workers. So that's one way to do it. You can also do them by functions, right? If you're looking at your customer facing teams versus more your back office teams.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut what we thought was important is how do you choose personas that are universal? Meaning that you could find these personas in your executive team, but you could even find them on the front line? So an example might be a learner persona, a learner persona may be somebody that is more focused on building their relationships? Is that concept learned at all? When you look at personas, it's not that every single attribute is only existent within that single persona. But it was really us thinking through what are the outcomes? How does that persona, think about their work? And what did they expect out of their work? What did they expect out of their manager? And what did they expect out of their growth track?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/the-art-of-balancing-employee-experience-and-customer-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"The Art of Balancing Employee Experience and Customer Experience\\\"\\u003eThe Art of Balancing Employee Experience and Customer Experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eGathering Employee Insights: Strategies Beyond Surveys\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, and they have to be receptive to giving you this information, too. Right. So was there a lot of one-on-one surveys, like, how do you extract this data from them?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, so I think that's a great question. There's multiple ways which you can approach \u2014 that you can go either through surveys \u2014 or you can take a more concentrated approach. I wouldn't recommend that all companies do this widespread, because it really depends on the level of trust, and the size of the organization you have. And then of course, it goes back to the outcomes, what are the objectives or the outcomes that the company is looking for? So for example, if a company is looking to better build your bench of successors, maybe you start this within your succession plan. So I don't say that there's a universal approach for everybody. But it really starts with what is the end in mind? And where will it make sense to develop these? And how will you use them going forward?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/cx-and-ex-how-to-rox-your-metrics\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"CX and EX: How to 'ROX' Your Metrics\\\"\\u003eCX and EX: How to 'ROX' Your Metrics\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBeyond Generic Surveys: Transparency in Employee Feedback\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, I do see a lot of companies that are very generic, right?

Because without transparency, then employees start to wonder, right? What is my company up to? And I think it's one of the things that a lot of employees are really leery of, because we know that there's data being collected about us in our personal lives. So it's also then bringing that into the workplace, and how are we being transparent with what data is being collected? And how will we be using it? So I think it is a fine line, it is a delicate line.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/great-cx-ex-the-formula-for-the-total-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Great CX + EX: The Formula for the Total Experience\\\"\\u003eGreat CX + EX: The Formula for the Total Experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eStructuring CX and EX: A Collaborative Approach\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eI want to dial it back a second to the structure of the organizational tree, if you will, in your world, April, because I think a lot of CX leaders, EX leaders that could be listening to this might be like, OK, how do they structure that?

And so we have governance councils where we have representation from each of the functional teams and regions across on the CX and the EX. So we make sure that everyone has a voice in the conversation.

First, you've got your layer of \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/sentiment-analysis-improves-the-customer-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"sentiment metrics,\\\"\\u003esentiment metrics,\\u003c\/a\\u003e which tells you what's happening in the experience. And these are true for both sides, EX and CX are sentiment metrics.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd then we also think about operational metrics or interaction metrics, which tell you what is happening in that touchpoint, or in that experience. And, you know, there was a great \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/04\/the-most-important-metrics-youre-not-tracking-yet\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Harvard Business Review article\\\"\\u003eHarvard Business Review article\\u003c\/a\\u003e, it was called CPI, the customer performance indicators. And they're the metrics you're not tracking.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so on the customer side, it's about what are all the transactions that our customers actually care about, but that businesses probably aren't tracking. And so you can parlay that into the employee side as well. And that would be called something like an EPI, right employee performance indicators.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhat are those transaction or operational touchpoints, those metrics that employees actually care about, or even candidates when a candidate is applying for a job? And how do you start tracking those? And it's the relationship between sentiment. So what is the feedback that you're getting in terms of satisfaction, ease of interaction? How do you compare that against what is happening within the experience, those operational metrics? And then at the end of the day, it becomes what are the outcome metrics to your point, which is where you started, which is the ROI.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo some of the specific ROI things that many, you know CX leaders look at is your \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/digital-markets\/insights\/what-is-customer-lifetime-value\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"customer lifetime value\\\"\\u003ecustomer lifetime value\\u003c\/a\\u003e, it's that big end metric. And of course, everyone is always looking at something similar to an\\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/what-is-the-net-promoter-score\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\" NPS\\\"\\u003e NPS\\u003c\/a\\u003e. And so we parlay that as well, onto the employee side. So there is an E, LTV, there's an employee lifetime value as well. And then there's an E, NPS. So those are some of the big outcome metrics that we look at.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut of course, I think at the end of the day, especially on the employee side, everyone is looking at how do we reduce turnover? How do we better retain our employees? How do we deliver this value proposition so that employees come here, because they're working towards a bigger purpose with the company and then at the end, that translates for value for our customers? So that's sort of a snapshot of how there's many layers into the metrics, but I think for the end ROI, we can still look at lifetime value.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eOne Experience Effort: The Commitment to CX and EX\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I just think the fact that you have a one experience effort is enough to at least get the employees thinking, OK, this company cares. This company cares about how I'm doing, and not just the bottom line. And when you're getting into those conversations with C-suite boards of directors, things like that, of course, they want to know how sales are looking quarter to quarter, they want to know the bottom line. But are you part of those conversations? April, you and your CMO, you know, sitting at a table? \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, yeah. \\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Give me a little snapshot of what goes on there. Because they have to be just as excited as you are about the combination of \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/3-ways-to-improve-ex-and-cx-at-the-same-time\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"CX and EX\\\"\\u003eCX and EX\\u003c\/a\\u003e.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eOh absolutely. Absolutely. And you know, what, it's important that we bring results. But what I value and I love the conversations that we have with our C-suite, is that it's equally important to how we get those results. Because that's the sustainability of performance of a company. It's not just a one shot thing, hey, let's just make this you know, one number, and it's the end of the day, but it's, it's the longevity of that. And that's how you really start to create a legacy. And so what I value is that our leadership team and our board of directors, they're looking at how do we as Onsemi leave a mark? How do we become a legacy in this space that we're in, especially with all this attention with what's going on with semiconductors, right? We're really trying to work on our value proposition. And we know it starts from the inside out.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eData-Driven Pivot: CX and EX Synergy Success\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, can you think of an example of an actual example where you took the data from EX and CX, and you kinda like said, hey, you know what, I think we need to pivot a little bit here in this department or that department? Is it something that sticks out? Like the story, the where, man, all of our efforts with this one experience actually turn things around for the better? Is there an example that stands out for you there?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I think one of the probably biggest examples, and I think a lot of companies, this will probably resonate with them, when it comes time to effectively or efficiently resolve customer issues. A lot of that is really dependent upon how fast your internal teams can turn around and answer right but it's not just any answer, it's the right answer. And it's hard to enable that. It requires steady systems, beyond that open communication and then of course, that you've got the right people standing at each of the posts.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo one of the things we started to look at was response times, how do we get more efficient about the quality of our responses and and the speed in which we do that. And so then internally, we had to come back and we said, you know, what does the data tell us in terms of IT tickets that employees open? Are we seeing a correlation there because we have to understand the pain points of our employees if we expect them to deliver for customers. And so this was really great because this was just a couple of weeks ago, we were on one of our council calls, and we said, let's dig in, let's start to look into this space. So this is where the light bulb started to go off. And we really started to understand that these things correlate if you solve the root cause of the problem, the person really at the end that's gonna benefit is our customer. So that is one area that we have diligently been working on as a team.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEmpowered Responses: Focus on Effective Communication\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u0026nbsp;Finding an answer. That's just resonated with me so much, because I'm just thinking of all my jobs I've ever had. And that's the biggest thing that blocks you in your day. It's like, Who do I ask?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Absolutely. Anybody, right. And even even in the consumer space, right? Whenever you have to reach out by email and contact a company, you're hoping you're crossing your fingers and hoping that the person that's going to respond to you is empowered, and knows the right answer, versus just brushing you off.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eI also think when we're talking about your employees, we need to be a little more specific. I should have asked you this earlier, but Onsemi like, give me the ballpark figure of number of employees that you care about that we're talking about here.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Thank you. We have over 33,000 global associates at Onsemi, so it is the whole kit and caboodle that we care about. We care about those experiences from our direct staff, we have a tremendous amount of our workforce that's in our manufacturing plants, as well as our indirect staff, which is all of our management folks that are across the globe.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e That is a lot of data to collect for you.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003eIt is certainly.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eTool Optimization: Streamlining CX and EX Processes\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eI mean, I think our company has the same number of employees without those, you know, zeros on it, just just the 33 part, you know, but I'm telling you that this resonates with even like a smaller organization too what you're saying because the problems are the same. You think it's easier trying to get an answer with 33 people than it is 33,000? Probably not. Right? It might even be easier with the bigger company because you have maybe some better technology, if you will. But speaking of technology, there's a lot of tools I'm imagining you use, what is your day-to-day tool usage look like? Is it too much? You know, are you always trying to say, hey, you know, we need a little audit here. I'm opening up too many tabs here? Or do you feel like you have a good structure in terms of your EX tools, your CX tools like all that?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, that's a great question. I think that people will always want more tools. But then the question becomes, how do you declutter all of the tools and the systems that you have to work with. So I think that is something that we have started to focus on. So in terms of how many tools that I have to work with, or my team, I think it's pretty consolidated. I mean, we've got a good pipeline into what we use for analytics. And, of course, certainly we use Excel for some parts of it. But there are a lot more advanced tools that are out there. I think what's important is that you have a good customer feedback platform. And if you can look for a customer feedback platform that also can serve your employee side because then you're just cutting out another vendor that you have to work with. And then you're all of your data can be in one place. The next thing is data visualization. And sometimes your feedback platform administrator isn't going to have the best data visualizer. So you know, it's finding what is that best tool?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhat I also found is, what's important is that internally, we align with what is the company already using? And let's vet that out together, what are the broad use cases that we can use across multiple businesses and functions, just so that we're consistent with how we look at data? Because what's important is now that we've gotten our functional leaders on board and functional teams understanding how to look at the data, well, wouldn't it just be horrible if every time you gotta go look at different dashboards, they're in completely different formats and different measurements. So this is one area to certainly streamline that way, you can really empower your functions to start building their iterations of the data, but you're all using a similar platform with a similar scale.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eVetting Vendors: An Approach to CX and EX Integration\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah. Are the vendors doing better? In that sense? I'm sure you're getting a lot of demos and talking to a lot trying to improve things or you have in the past, the vendors doing better in terms of having CX and EX under one roof because obviously that would be ideal.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I think there's a lot of them that are starting in this space. But what I found is everyone's got a marketing tactic. And so it's really incumbent upon your CX, EX or your one experience leader to really probe in those questions because a lot of times that demos will show you a sketch or a mock up because they want to land your business. But what you really want to ask for when you're vetting out a vendor in this space is you want to say, look, let's sign an NDA, I'm going to give you some of our data, and I want you to model it live for me because that's the difference between the folks that will tell you yes, we can do it, they'll mock up a picture. But once you get into that relationship, you'll start to see Oh, you mean, you didn't have those capabilities built out, which can be incredibly frustrating. So I do think that vendors are getting better in this space. But like I said, it cannot just be turnkey, the head of the department that's making the decision on the technology really has to know the questions to ask and if you don't know yourself and bring the people from your team, who will ask those questions.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eKey Skills for Onsemi's One Experience Team Members\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah exactly. I want to talk about skill sets. Now. Your CX EX team, your one experience team, what sort of skill sets? Do you feel that team members within one experience need these days? You know, what are you looking for, if you were writing up a job description for someone to come in, and just crush it on that one experience team?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eFirst and foremost, individuals have to be learning it all. They have to be curious. I mean because that is the foundation of looking at data and trying to find the story that's sitting within the data. The other thing that I started to share with my team is have pride in your role if you do end up landing on an experienced team, because to me, experience, teams are holistic, meaning you have to understand every function across a business. And not just that, but you also have to understand context, because the data is going to tell you one piece of the story. But you have to be able to build relationships within the functions to truly understand and validate what you're seeing and to ask, why is it this way? Because it's not until you get that extra context where then you can work together to say, do we have the right goal? What goals should it be? And then what are the actions that we should be doing together in order to get to that goal because chances are the action plan around the goal, it's not just going to involve that one function and the experience team. It's going to involve HR or it's going to involve IT. So it's really people it\u2019s got to be in these roles where they want to be collaborators facilitators, again, it goes back to the curiosity, you have to want to hear the other side of the story beyond just what the data is telling you.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eLean Six Sigma and Scrum in CX and EX Strategy\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah. And speaking of skill sets, I know you, yourself being a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt and Certified Scrum Product Owner, you know, how does that weave into your day to day?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I love the question. And yes, it is, as you go along in your career, you never think we're going to use this again later. But I think for me, especially with the Lean Six, Sigma, the background, and the certification, it really taught me this process-minded thinking, it has taught me how to frame up a problem, what are the right questions you need to ask? Where do you get the data? And beyond that, also facilitation? How do you get everybody to come together to move towards a common goal? How do you resolve the issue? And then how do you put a control plan in place to make sure that those results don't backslide?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo I think that's one of the big things that I took away. And I've learned throughout my career of the company that really I earned my certification from, it was part of the DNA of that company, it was expected that if you became a black belt, that eventually when you progressed on into your career, that you would take those principles of continuous improvement and that thinking into your leadership roles. And that way you could mentor and guide your organization's. So that was one piece, right, understanding the process. But I think the second one is the Certified Scrum Product Owner, it was an opportunity to really learn how do you get the digital stuff done? How does it get prioritized because the process piece is one side, right?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYou fix the process, but sometimes you still need technology to get that extra mile. So that was the next piece of really process and working with Scrum and Agile. And so marrying those two together really becomes the perfect blend. I think it's those two, then it's also the change management piece. So it's understanding all three of how those pieces fit together, really brings together the trifecta of what's needed to be on an experienced team. It's all three pieces that have to work together at the end of the day, it comes down to people, process and technology.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eIntegrating CX and EX: Starting Points for Leaders\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, exactly. And then finally, I want to just bring this all together. There's so many good data points of so many good anecdotes from allowing us inside your world at Onsemi. I really appreciate it. I'm a CX leader, I'm a VP of customer experience. I think we're not doing enough with \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/ex-and-cx-come-down-to-the-same-thing-put-the-person-first\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"employee experience\\\"\\u003eemployee experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e. Where do I even begin?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u0026nbsp;Wow. Well, if you want to start the conversation, I think it's first seeking out do you have an employee experience leader or within the company, and sitting down and starting to share the what ifs. And then starting to ask about some of the data, especially since you have that experience from the CX side, start asking, because it starts again with the curiosity. And once you get that EX leader sort of on board and seeing where you're coming from, then it becomes your vision together that you can build. And then the possibilities are endless. But I think it starts again, with the curiosity, bring what you know, and start asking questions, because you want to learn about the other side.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe Evolution of Employee Experience: From HR to Holistic\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eIt's amazing how far we\u2019ve come, isn't it? April, I remember getting a job in the early 2000s. In my employee experience was the HR people giving me my email and my benefits. And I didn't hear from them again. I mean, it's insane how far we've come, right?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHo-Nishimura: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eAbsolutely. And I think a lot of it has to do with the pandemic, right, a lot of power has been shifted back to employees, which I think is great. Employees are starting to see that, hey, look, the value I bring is significant. And I want to work for an employer that's going to embrace that. And it's going to help me grow, especially now since right. There's a lot of people that can work remotely. And so even more employee experience becomes so much more important. And it's not just about the big tech firms having Ping-Pong table in there and everyone getting free food. It's more about what you value as an employee and everyone values something differently, which goes back to personas.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eInsights on CX and EX Fusion\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, you can actually have a good employee experience department outside of the Ping-Pong table, right. It's amazing how you can pull that off, you know. April Ho-Nishimura. I mean, we can't thank you enough for being on CX Decoded. Now, we should call this one CX EX Decoded for real.

You know, before we get into the meat of the show, we're gonna talk about contact centers, AI, digital investment, all that good stuff. But I like to know more about Shri. You know, tell us about your journey and everything in the world of digital transformation. And what inspired you to get into the roles that you've been in?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Sure. I have a background in technology, I started as a programmer, I used to type out PHP code by hand. That's how old I am. So I moved from the sort of hard coding side to the more product and project management side of things with the more business side of things. And my journey in midlife was all about digital transformation. And I had so many good mentors who taught me how to understand the customer, how to write customer journeys, and how to use data to analyze what the customer is thinking. And it just opened up this entire new world of being able to serve the customer, it wasn't just about getting the job done. And going home, I'm actually seeing that these transformative initiatives are making a difference to the customer's life. And it just became the thing that I have been doing for the last 20 years is, all I want to do is create customer experiences that are meaningful to the customer. So since MetLife, that has been my goal, I have always been able to lead product, and engineering teams and sort of go from end to end, you know, think of the product as a concept and then execute it. So it's been a really interesting journey, especially as we move into the whole AI realm of things. It's starting to get even more interesting.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/digital-transformation-in-customer-experience-and-the-butterfly-effect\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Digital Transformation in Customer Experience and the Butterfly Effect\\\"\\u003eDigital Transformation in Customer Experience and the Butterfly Effect\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAI's Impact: Technology Transforming Industries Once Again\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e I know transformative technology that's out there right now. I mean, have you seen anything that quickly, just transcended a whole industry like AI? And we're not even there and what it actually will do someday, right? I mean, it's gonna get better and better. Some people say scarier and scarier, I think better and better. But, I mean, have you seen an impact like this in your role, like the internet was certainly impactful, right? I mean, the evolution of that, I'd say,\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, absolutely. I think the mid 90s, when we saw the internet boom, was similar. Everybody said everybody's gonna go online shopping, no, no more retail stores and things like that. So that was the first hype cycle. And then about 10 years ago, we had the AI hype cycle, start up with predictive AI. And now we're in the, I think of it as the second AI hype cycle where we have generative AI, which is, it's just made AI available to everybody. It's not like AI didn't exist. It's always been around, you know, robots have been trying to take over forever. So it's not new, but it's become more approachable and available. And it's just amazing how much it is affecting our lives as people who produce products and as people who consume products. It's an amazing transformation.

Because that's like the big day, right when ChatGPT came out? I'm sure a lot of the AI engineers and researchers have like, yeah, that's one of the days but for me and looking at that as an editor, I mean, I use it really consistently to analyze large amounts of text. What are some of the big early wins for you and your role as a practitioner?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e One of the most recent things we've done is a live person AI chatbot and it's just had a phenomenal level of success in improving our customers lives, and the data that's coming out of it is just so beneficial to us and to the customers to the bottom line. The other side to it is how it is affecting our team's productivity. We're starting to use AI to write code, to write requirements, and you know, to make our lives easier. So it's had an effect on both how we do the work and the kind of work that we produce. So it's been interesting experience for us to see how it actually has a cost benefit analysis to it. So we're actually seeing an uptick in revenue because we are using AI. That was unexpected. I thought I was just experimenting with it, but it actually had a positive effect almost right away.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/super-power-your-teams-with-generative-ai-in-customer-service\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Super-Power Your Teams With Generative AI in Customer Service\\\"\\u003eSuper-Power Your Teams With Generative AI in Customer Service\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAI Chatbots Enhance Staff Productivity and Loyalty\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, and implementing something like that, you know, into a chatbot. Has that led to more training? Has that led to additional hires, you know, AI scientists? I mean, that kind of thing, like, what impact would it have on staff? Because people are wondering, is it going to replace me, but you have been doing this, so what's the impact on staff with AI implementations for you?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e So that's the pushback you will get from operations, as you know, is this going to take away my job, so one of the things we did was to build the chatbot with the contact center, not for them. So we involved them from day one, and explained to them how this is gonna make their life easier. So this is how chatbots work, if you take away, 95% of our calls are handled by the chatbot, they are contained, it never goes to an agent. So what happens to the other 5%, the other 5% are the high value customers, the ones who are high maintenance, the ones who have bigger problems, the ones who are yelling and screaming. Previously, the staff, one person was not able to spend more than two minutes for the high value customer. Now they're able to stay on the phone with them for 20 minutes and solve their problem. And they have built loyalty. So it's not like the staff has gone away, or their jobs have been taken away. But they have moved on to delivering more meaningful solutions to our customers, you know, to the ones who really need it. So that is the effect that something like an AI chatbot has, it's not about taking away jobs. It's about rethinking how you treat your customers and how you use the skill set that you have. Even in terms of modeling, we have an AI\/ML team. And we have them creating models for us all day long to do all kinds of things. But now that AI is here, their focus has shifted a little bit to thinking about how can we use our skills in that direction, as opposed to just bringing it for underwriting or fraud or anything like that. So it's more of a rewiring as opposed to you know, getting rid of people or hiring people or anything like that. It's more of a rewiring of the skill set that we already have.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAI Call Resolution: Achieving 95% Success Rate\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e And you know, something you said about the stat that 95%. That can't be industry standard that 95% of these calls get solved right by AI? That's phenomenal.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, because that's how simple it is, right? Like, you don't have to overthink it, you just sort of categorize the customer problems and say these are all the you know, problems we need to solve and put the answers in there. And then the AI picks it up. But we didn't get there overnight. It took us about a year to get to 95%. It's not overnight, and even then we are constantly tweaking, we're looking at the data. And we're tweaking the data that we're feeding into the language models. So it's not that it's easy, or that it's overnight, but it's doable. It's entirely possible.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/ai-in-customer-experience-5-companies-tangible-results\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"AI in Customer Experience: 5 Companies' Tangible Results\\\"\\u003eAI in Customer Experience: 5 Companies' Tangible Results\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAI Implementation Eases Stress for Contact Center Employees\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah. And one of the things we talk about Shri a lot at CMSWire is employee experience in the context center. Right? And how good customer experience strategies and tools and leadership can help employee experience naturally because that isn't unforgiving job. No one in the context center that answers phones all day gets a call that goes like this. Hi. Just wanted you to know you're awesome. And you're doing a great job goodbye. It never happens. It's always a problem. How has the implementation of AI like directly impacted employee experience would you say?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e I think it has reduced stress levels a lot. I was mentioning the fact that they can stay on the call with one person for about 20 minutes. And that makes a huge difference to the employee and to the customer. The more time you can give them and solve their problems. Instead of saying I'm sorry, you'll have to come back in two days or let me put you on hold or Let me transfer you to another person. You are giving their personal attention to one individual for that long. It makes a difference in the life of both the customer and the employee. We're seeing the data that proves that as well is more and more of the calls that are being handled by the agents are getting contained. They're solving problems. They are arriving at a solution that helps everybody. So I think it's definitely been a positive experience for employees.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow Long to Achieving 95% Efficiency in AI Implementation\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah. You said one year to really get to that 95%. That's a journey. In fact, that seems fast in the business world to me.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Not these days. One year, I mean, we should have gotten there a whole lot sooner when we started about 60, 65%. And it sort of stayed that way for a while. And then suddenly it started going up as we started analyzing the data. But sometimes you look back, I mean, hindsight is 20\/20. Right. So, you know, you look back and you say, I wish I had looked at the data sooner, but that's okay. I mean, I'll take it at this point.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eData Insights Drive AI Success: From 65% to 95%\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah. What are the specific differences and challenges between the 65 percenters? I'll call them and the 95 percenters? What gets you over the hump specifically, what challenges are happening at the 65% level, and what gets you to that increase like 50%?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e You need a good business intelligence team, you need to have people whose brains work in that way who look at numbers and derive insights. And I cannot do that. I cannot look at data and have it speak to me in that way. So I have a really strong team of business intelligence folks who are constantly mining the data from the AI chatbot. And we also get a lot of information from live persons themselves, a lot of insights coming our way. So you need to be able to do that from day one, which is probably what we did not do is you need to be able to look at that data and mine it and, and sort of get into the heads of your customers. And that way from day one, there's no scope for delay. And I think that's something that we should have understood sooner, and it became a bit of a challenge. But now that, you know, we get that we're sort of getting smarter about how we look at the data and how quickly we react to it.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAI in Customer Experience: Customer Satisfaction Grows, but Challenges Remain\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e And those resolution times 95% is huge, like we've been talking about. It has it translated in customer satisfaction terms, resolutions, great, and customers problem solved. But they did have a problem, right? So you know, how has this transferred over to things like customer satisfaction, customer effort score,\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eWe had an NPS goal of 30. And we got there, but we got there slowly, but not as fast as I would like. The problem with NPS is it doesn't tell you why, it just gives you a sort of score. So we also have a CSAT score that goes along with that. That gives us a better idea about why are they satisfied? Why are they unhappy? The customer satisfaction score has been sort of, it's not as steady as I would like, it goes up and down. And it's a little bit volatile. And we're not sure why. And that's what we're trying to dive into. We're trying to categorize some of the questions that we're getting. And in the 5%, that is not contained. What are some of the questions that we're not answering? Is that the cause for the CSAT scores to go down? We don't know. That's the that's point where we're at right now is trying to figure out why, why is everything else looking so great, but not that, you know, it's a bit of a mystery to us.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eUnlocking Opportunities: Beyond Basic AI Chatbot Metrics\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Within an AI chatbot? What kind of data do you want out of that? And do you get, the data mining? Obviously, you get resolution rate, that's great. What other kinds of pieces of data would help a contact center from an AI chatbot?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e I want to know how long the bot takes to contain a problem. Like we dropped from six minutes to three minutes on agent related calls. But what about the bot? How long is it taking? I definitely want to know how long it takes for the bot to sort of it's like, isn't meandering through meaningless questions before arriving at the right one, you know that that's what that tells me. I also want to derive data that helps me solve other problems. For example, we realize that almost 50% of our customers are asking about refinance. What does that mean? I think that's where we want to use the chatbot data, it\u2019s not just to say the agent did this or the bot did that or the containment was this, but what other problems will be solved. So we created a whole marketing stream to target our refinance customers and prequalify them and so on. So it created a whole new revenue stream that didn't exist before because of the data that we saw in the chatbot. So it's going beyond what the chatbot is telling us and deriving solutions to problems for the company as sort of like an enterprisewide solution, as opposed to just looking at the sort of basic chatbot metrics.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eIncorporating Marketing Insights Into AI Chatbot Branding\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, you know, would a marketing team in the situation kind of get involved like, hey, we want the chatbot to be branded or those kinds of things, does that ever come into play, or is it just you know what, we're gonna go straightforward with problem solving. Let's not worry about tone, let's not worry about the color. You know, that kind of thing. I could see a marketing team being like we need a say here.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eOh, we absolutely have branded our chatbot. We call it Penny, we didn't put too much thought into that. But she, the chatbot is a she. And she has branded the marketing team, everybody was looped in from day one, the marketing team, the underwriting fraud, everybody was looted from day one. So the marketing team has definitely had a say in branding it. And I think that's a good thing. I think it's important to talk about these things from a perspective of how does it appear to the customer, if the customer is not seeing a branded brand experience, then that might be a little bit of a problem. So I think that's a good thing. They also frequently listen in on the data, like I was talking about the refinance piece to see what they can help us with in terms of marketing efforts, paid and social and all that stuff. So absolutely. Marketing is a big part of this.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eKey Players in the AI Chatbot Implementation Journey\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eIn a journey like this, who else needs to be involved to make it happen?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eObviously, IT, I mean, there are folks that need to be involved from day one, like the contact center folks, the IT folks, the marketing folks, being in the industry that we are, there's a lot of regulation and compliance. It's important for us to make sure that we haven't, you know, put something out there that could get us into CFPB trouble or anything like that. So we definitely have them involved as well. There is not a lot of scope for risk and fraud when it comes to any chatbot, it's just answering your question, but we still keep them in the loop. And then of course, the AI ml team, I mean, they are actively looking at all of this data and you know, taking it and putting it into a data lake and analyzing, and so on and so forth. So it's more than just dropping an iframe on a website, it takes a lot of effort to put a chatbot.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEnhancing Customer Engagement With AI Chatbot Copiloting\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eGotta say, I think Penny has a good name, I could never like scream at a Penny. Penny, you're not listening. The bottom line for me is just, you know, solving the problem, of course, and I'm a fan of the chatbots and self service. I'd rather I don't even care how long it takes I if you know if I can send them a message and then go do some work. Go back like oh, they answered. It's been 20 minutes. I forgot about it. But I'll go back. Sometimes you can't account for that too, with customers, right? Like you never know, if they're just doing work. They're cranking out emails, and they're not fully invested in the conversation that might reflect on the chatbot like, oh, this took 25 minutes, it should have been five. But for me, it has taken 25 minutes because I forgot I was talking to one.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, that absolutely happens. And we're trying to look at the data for that and see if we can solve that using, you know, sort of copilot. I was at a conference and I saw this, I forget the name of the company, but they had this chatbot that would just mirror everything that the user is doing. And I thought that was fantastic. Because you're keeping the customer engaged, you're seeing what they're doing, without actually getting into their computer, you're mirroring them, and then you're walking them through it. You're saying I'm holding your hand and help me you know, click on the screen, see what happens. It's as if someone is sitting next to you and helping you. And I think that's fantastic, especially with somebody who has a really big problem. I think that sort of copiloting is hugely beneficial. And we're trying to experiment with that. We're trying to pilot that a little bit. Here. There's a conversational copilot, and then there's an autopilot, where it's just the bot does it it doesn't hand off to an agent, the bot is the pilot. So it's just also fascinating to talk about. We have to see how how it helps the customer at the end of the day.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eVoice Chatbots: The Future or a Work in Progress?\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eHow about voice like is there a future for or even a present day for voice chatting with a chatbot? Like, hey, I need to pay my bill. I can't figure it out in the chat. Because about like, Yeah, let's figure this out. Dom. You know, I know there's IVR and all that like on phones and all that. But I wonder if AI can sneak that in and like a chatbot setting like you click on the chat bot on the website. And here comes a voice.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eI think that's happening now in some places. And and I think that's a good idea. The only problem with that is I don't know that anyone has managed to make the bots sound human. You can tell it's a bot and it's not real. I don't know that we have come to a point where it sounds so natural and so friendly that you can tell the difference. And that's the problem. I hate talking to bots. I feel like you know, what the hell do we type into a machine like where's the real person? That sort of thing. But maybe that technology is out there? And I haven't seen it. But I don't think there's a board out there that sounds human and that might be what stops it from taking off. But I don't think we're that far from it.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e2024 Vision: AI in Contact Centers\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eLooking ahead, let's say 2024. We're here in 2024 a year from today. What are some of the things you hope as a practitioner in this space of implementing AI into contact centers into customer experience scenarios? What will you have hoped to accomplish? What's going to be the next level AI infusion into customer experience if you will.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e The thing that we we're just talking about the voice thing, I think that would be super nice if we can just get the calls handled with doing a warm handoff, and the customer has no idea that happened. That would be fantastic. I don't think that customer contact centers are going away. I don't think that that's going to happen. And I don't think people should aim for that. I think the human touch is always important. Having an agent at the end of the line is always important, just in case. So I don't think that's going away. But how can we use AI to improve their life not just in a way that like, what is the chatbot doing? But are there AI tools that they can use? Once they have to call? Or do they have tools at their disposal to be able to solve the problem much more quickly? And I think that's where we should be heading? Not, let's get rid of contact centers, but more how do we use AI to empower the contact centers?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAI Ethics and Transparency in Implementations\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, that makes sense. And Shri, one thing we haven't jumped into very deeply is AI ethics, transparency, I mean, on the day that we're recording the Competition and Markets Authority in Britain set out a whole list of AI principles. And you know, haven't read the whole doc yet. But most of it is centered on transparency, letting consumers know that you're using this kind of technology, does that come into the equation when you're building out these kinds of AI implementations?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Absolutely. I think we're just talking about chatbots here, but there's so much more to it. Right? We are giving responses to the customer that come under a certain jurisdiction of compliance in legality. So we're saying, Yeah, absolutely. This is our check cashing rate, we have to make sure that we're not making stuff up on the chatbot, we have to be sure that we're giving them the right information that we are giving them information that is helpful. We are using AI to write code. There's a certain level of quality control that comes in because you're using AI because AI is making up stuff. Is it writing code that might be breaking some rule? Is it writing code that is going beyond a certain quality issues or legal issues, compliance issues. So every time you use something that's generated by a machine, you have to think about ethics and quality and the effect it has on the customer, I don't think you can just write AI code and then just leave it alone there too do whatever it wants. I think there's a lot of monitoring and handling that needs to happen.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eChallenges and Benefits of AI Code\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Write AI code, I just love how you say that so seamlessly. Like, I wish I could do that. I mean, you write in PHP by hand, now you're doing AI code. Any differences there at the end of the day is coding, coding, and it's just challenging all along.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I mean, the GitHub, it's called GitHub copilot. And he said, we're going to use it. And it just generated so much nonsense. I'm watching my language on the podcast, but it just generated so much nonsense. So we realized we need to beef up our sort of quality control measures. But at the end of the day, it works. You know, it really freed up a lot of time for us.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eStart Small and Build a Roadmap: Leveraging AI for Customer Experience\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eGood. Well, let's wrap up things with one big takeaway, or just a few big takeaways on if I'm a customer experience leader, listening to this, a chief customer officer, and they just don't feel like they've leveraged AI technology to the fullest yet in their contact center, and or they need some employee experience boosts. They need some NPS boosts. And they say, You know what, I think AI is the way to go. I'm liking what Shri saying, but where do I get started? What's my first move in this big picture here?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShri: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eGet started anywhere. I mean, you have 1000 things at your disposal, pick one, maybe just pick something simple that helps your team like writing code or writing requirements, you don't have to install a major lead chatbot or anything like that. Get started by talking to people who have the service like there are so many off the shelf products, start talking to them, understand what's out there. We don't have to make sweeping changes in digital transformation doesn't have to be like, Oh, we install all this great software. It doesn't have to be like that. We can start small, you know, do small and simple things and then have a roadmap. There's all this AI at your disposal? How does it make sense for your organization? There are only three reasons to do something: it makes money for your company, it's meaningful to the customer and your technology can support it. So look at these three factors and see what fits in and build a roadmap so that you have a plan instead of sort of sitting in this. I think of it as an innovation workshop where you're saying I'm going to do all these shiny new things, but I don't know what it means but have a business outcome. Have a plan and start small. I think it's it doesn't have to be complicated.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eThe Wrap-Up: Shri Nandan\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, I'm excited to see that too.

Ferrell has been pivotal in building his organization's design team and has a unique perspective on merging technology, business strategy, and design to forge impactful customer interactions. In the fast-evolving landscape of experience design, four elements stand out: personalization, product design, team dynamics and business impact. As businesses strive to engage users more deeply, these components have become critical in driving customer loyalty and propelling brand growth. Industry professionals are increasingly focusing on how to seamlessly integrate these facets to offer not just a product, but an experience that resonates with the consumer. From small startups to major corporations, the stakes have never been higher in capturing and sustaining user attention.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\",\"transcriptHtml\":\"\\u003ch3\\u003eThe Gist\\u003c\/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eInnovation focus.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003ePersonalization in product design drives brand growth.\\u003c\/em\\u003e\\u003c\/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eBalancing act. \\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eCustomization and scalability must be balanced for companywide capabilities for personalized experiences.\\u003c\/em\\u003e\\u003c\/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCross-functionality crucial.\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003e Cross-functional teams enhance problem-solving and customer-focused product development.\\u003c\/em\\u003e\\u003c\/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eBusiness-design link.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eLinking design choices to business dynamics is essential for effective decision-making.\\u003c\/em\\u003e\\u003c\/li\\u003e\\u003c\/ul\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eThis episode is brought to you by \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.wix.com\/studio?utm_source=CMSwire\\u0026amp;utm_medium=Podcastad\\u0026amp;utm_campaign=SL\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Wix Studio\\\"\\u003eWix Studio\\u003c\/a\\u003e.\\u003c\/em\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom Nicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Hello, everybody, Dom Nicastro here from CMSWire and CX Decoded.

Huge topic. But Forget all that. Let's talk about Jason for a second, what's going on? What's up? What do you bring to the table, give me a fun fact about you not related to work,\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJason:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e And happy to do that, great fact, and just happened recently. So my husband and I have owned for the past 15 years a bakery, and sold it last week. This was a concept we started from scratch, 15 years ago. It's been an amazing ride. We had a chance to work with some amazing people and do some really fun things in the community. And now we're passing the torch to another entrepreneur, a couple as well, who I know will take the brand to new heights.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eThat's a fun fact. What was the bakery called?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJason: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, it's called Frostings Bake Shop. And so it will still live on. We're sad to see it go but excited to see what they'll do with it.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eDom: That wins me over in a second. You just hit the jackpot for marketing with Dom Nicastro. Because I'm a frosting guy through and through. You know, those people that leave frosting and just eat the cake. I'm like, Hey, what are you doing? Give me that plate. Let's go to tackling. I'm in. Well, that's an awesome, fun fact. I love it. And let's segue into you know, the working world. So we said managing vice president of experience design Capital One, how did you get in that role? Like what's the evolution of Jason's ascension into the financial industry and the role you're in now?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJason: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, so the common thread for me and my, really, my career, but I can see it now back to even the interest I had when I was a child is I've always been interested in what makes people tick. And when I was a kid, I really focused on journalism. My outlet was the school newspaper.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicastro:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Same:\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFerrell:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I thought I was gonna go into broadcast journalism, and then pivoted in undergrad to business and found that I could apply my innate curiosity in marketing. And so my origin and design is really through research. And I'll speed ahead just to kind of say, when design was established as a real core job discipline at Capital One that corresponded with our technology transformation when we realized we needed to really like rebuild the entire infrastructure of how the company ran, we recognized that we needed to invest in disciplines like product management, and data science and design was one of them.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eI had been at the company already and found my lean and research was really the application of insights on the customer experience. And so I got a chance to be a part of building the design team from scratch when we started here. And it's been a fascinating ride, to build a new discipline and do that amidst a very mature company and mature business practices and already at scale. And so now for the past nine years, we've been educating internal partners and stakeholders on how design can help move the business forward. So today, my focus is on our consumer credit card business, our premium product segment and our retail bank.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eI love the paths of CX people in marketing people because they're never the same. They're never the same. It's like a lawyer takes the bar passes it, goes to work. NFL quarterback, awesome in high school, scouted drafted, goes to work, CX people in marketing. It's like, Hey, I was an architect to start or I was a math teacher. It's just fascinating. Where you folks come from?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJason: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eI totally agree. And I try to remind the team about that a lot. Because I think the diversity in our backgrounds is actually one of the things that really makes us a strong unit. We all have different paths. But the common thread across all of us is that we just love to solve problems for people. And that usually is the motivation that drives decisions that led us here. And so there's a lot of power in the diversity of the team and I tried to harness it.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003ePersonalization in UI Design\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah. And I think CX people, marketing people, journalists like me, I think we love the fact that there's no right or wrong answer. There's no math equation, right? It's just like, No, you have to design this credit card this way. Like no, you can be creative and everything. I love it. Jason, thanks for giving us the lay of the land there on you professionally, personally, so fun to meet you. So we're going to break down this conversation of experience design into kind of like four buckets. We're going to start with \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-experience\/mastering-personalization-in-digital-marketing-strategy\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"personalization in product design\\\"\\u003epersonalization in product design\\u003c\/a\\u003e and team dynamics, then we're going to move on to art and science of personalization, leveraging cross functional teams, and connecting experience and business outcomes. So it's all gonna be woven together, kind of in those four buckets. So are you ready? Let's do it. I am OK, let's go. So let's start with topic number one, Jason, personalization and product design and team dynamics. Could you share some examples of how Capital One has incorporated personalization in its product design, and team dynamics kind of enhance brand growth, and ultimately drive \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/3-newish-ways-to-think-about-customer-loyalty\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"customer loyalty\\\"\\u003ecustomer loyalty\\u003c\/a\\u003e?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJason:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e You know, the area of our businesses that makes me think about are some recent innovations we've been doing in the travel market. So a few years ago, we launched some new credit card products and very core to the value proposition of that product is playing a role in travel. So customers earn rewards miles. And we know that customers love to use those for travel. And it's sort of been an industry expectation that in this part of the rewards credit card market, that you had some travel portal where you could actually facilitate travel booking for customers, but it was always a bolt on. And we knew if we were going to get into this part of the market, we needed to do it differently. And we were going to do it in a way that is really core to the DNA of how the company runs, and we're able to connect it to your prompt around \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/ai-in-ecommerce-true-one-on-one-personalization-is-coming\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"personalization\\\"\\u003epersonalization\\u003c\/a\\u003e.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo to me, personalization is really about understanding our customers, and what they need and what their context is, and how do we fit into their life. And when we looked at the way the industry had, the way the credit card industry had been playing, and in travel, it was, it just wasn't anything that we wanted to replicate. And so we actually went a different route, entered an agreement with \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.hopper.com\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Hopper\\\"\\u003eHopper\\u003c\/a\\u003e as a partner to help us reimagine what a credit card being in the travel game looks like. And what was so critical about that, and when we thought about what product werel we actually going to design? And how would we use some of Hopper\u2019s leading technology? The question came back to well, what are our customers\u2019 needs, and where are the pain points and travel and travel is this really interesting tension where for most of us, it represents a source of joy. And it evokes something very, very positive, when we are planning what we want to, where we want to go and who we're going to go with and the experiences that we'll have.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut then the flip side is the actual executing of it can be quite a drag, it can be hard to know, if you're getting the best deal, you can find yourself in this paralysis state. Because there's so many alternatives in terms of how you can search for destinations and ways to get there and how you're often doing that with people and how you share this part of the journey, which is planning. And that led to the product that we built, having some really, really core features like price watch guarantees, and price freezes, and things that took some of the hesitation and frustration out of just the planning part of travel alone, \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/information-architecture-vs-user-interface-design-understanding-the-differences\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"how we built the UI\\\"\\u003ehow we built the UI\\u003c\/a\\u003e kind of stripping it away from all of the industry practices on upsells, and cross sells and barraging you with information in the moment with a very kind of simple and \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/information-architecture-vs-user-interface-design-understanding-the-differences\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"elegant UI \\\"\\u003eelegant UI \\u003c\/a\\u003ethat starts with Where do you want to go? And when are you going? So we approached it really differently. All of it laddering back to what we felt people wanted and what they need when they're at the beginning of their travel journey.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/how-ux-design-customer-metrics-can-improve-customer-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"How UX Design Customer Metrics Can Improve Customer Experience\\\"\\u003eHow UX Design Customer Metrics Can Improve Customer Experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBalancing Customization and Scalability in Product Design\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eI love those two questions. Where do you want to go? And when are you going? That's what's on all of our minds, when we start thinking about the possibility of a nice vacation, whether it's with a big family, whether it's just one couple alone, what have you, it's like, what and when am I going? Where am I going? That's right. And it's so nice to have that actually, you know, can you jump back one sec, and kind of explain a little more on what Hopper is that integration just in case? Someone's not totally familiar with that?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJason: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, so Hopper is a third party that helps facilitate a lot of the product that we built for the Capital One customer to use.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e All right, cool. Now moving on, in the whole context of personalization, have you seen the balance between customization and scalability playing out in your whole product design efforts?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJason:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, absolutely. Like there are two things that that make me think about first is a company with the scale that Capital One has, it's really important from a platform perspective that we have capabilities that enable us to meet the needs of multiple segments and sub segments of the marketplace and can do that through share channels. So, for instance, the experience you might have with our mobile app might actually be a little bit different than the one that I have, because it's unique to the products that we each have with Capital One. So we've spent and obsessed a lot about what are the underlying capabilities across the company that enable each individual to feel like they're having a personalized experience with us. And then, when you've done that, from a platform perspective, then the various businesses can bring to bear a deep understanding of the customer and the businesses that we're trying to be in and leverage the capabilities that exist from an enterprise perspective.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-marketing\/3-ways-ecommerce-brands-can-use-ai-for-personalization\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"3 Ways Ecommerce Brands Can Use AI for Personalization\\\"\\u003e3 Ways Ecommerce Brands Can Use AI for Personalization\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eKey Metrics for Measuring Success in Personalization Strategie\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eIt always comes back to \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/20-customer-experience-metrics-critical-for-your-business\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"metrics\\\"\\u003emetrics\\u003c\/a\\u003e and \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/5-cx-kpis-companies-are-improving-with-ai\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"KPIs\\\"\\u003eKPIs\\u003c\/a\\u003e too, right? Like, what are those specific metrics that you use to actually measure the success in personalization? You know, because we're, as a media company, you know, we're always doing things behind the scenes, right? We're trying to SEO up the story. At the end of the day, we got to say, all right, how do we do?

I mean, every business and every product might have its own unique KPIs based on the nature of what the product is and how customers use it. But it's going to be very familiar things like are users able to complete the tasks that they're attempting with us. We obsess about how long that might take, and how frequently do they reach error states? And when and what happens when they do? Where do they go? And how do we ensure that we're ultimately ensuring that task completion happens. And a lot of ways some of the very core like usability measures that many industries focus on, you know, this isn't just unique to design and financial services, but are ones that the design team is going to obsess about. And really like I think our role from a design perspective is ensuring that the business doesn't just think about them as design metrics, but that they are core business metrics, just like each business might have its own unique view into revenue and operating expenses. Like, I think our most mature state is when we're looking at all of these aspects of the business that we're in, in one place and in one dashboard, and reviewing them together.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article:\\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-marketing\/finding-the-goldilocks-zone-of-marketing-measurement\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\" Finding the Goldilocks Zone of Marketing Measurement\\\"\\u003e Finding the Goldilocks Zone of Marketing Measurement\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eLeading Experience Design Teams Through Failed Metrics and Quick Pivots\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYou know, you're working with this team of designers that are on your team that report to you, when a metric comes in to slap you in the face and says this didn't work. Like at that moment as a leader in experience design, like what's the message to the team, because you must feel so good. When you release the change, you release the UI, you release the new product, and you're like, This is gonna be awesome. And then your metrics say, No, it's not. At that moment, how do you rally the troops,\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJason: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eMost of the work that we do is digital. And we are so fortunate to get to apply experience design in a digital context because of how fast you can pivot and experiment. So I think it's really important to have a growth mindset, particularly when we're trying something new, where we don't have a whole lot of exposure to how something is going to perform, or a lot of best practices in terms of maybe how to design it from scratch, and things of that nature. So it's an input. And then what's most important is in how quickly do we pivot? What do we learn from it? And then how do we ensure that learning then reaches others who might be on the same path just maybe a little bit further behind? And really, that's a growth mindset and design. But I think it's actually a mindset that the company has, and really embraces. Capital One has always been on the forefront of experimentation and creating value where it didn't exist. And you know, you're not always going to get that right. Right off the bat.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, and the word that comes up for me when you're talking through that is agile, right? being agile, having agility in the actual, do you actually run \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-marketing\/8-characteristics-of-high-performing-agile-teams\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"agile teams and sprints\\\"\\u003eagile teams and sprints\\u003c\/a\\u003e and all that good stuff do?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJason: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, we do. And a lot of the work that the design team does, happens inside the agile context. And there's a lot of discovery work that might happen outside of it and informs it. But yeah, it's critical for teams developing software to have both the mindset and the operating model that enable us to move fast and respond to things in the real world. The other thing that I would say is how we set up tests and roll experiences out and learn from them. In smaller, isolated environments. For instance, you know, the picture you were painting in terms of something not going as you might think it would, that's a lot less impactful if you're experimenting with 1% population than a full scale rollout. So how we go to market also impacts things of that nature.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBalancing Art and Science in Experience Design for Customer Engagement\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Let's move on to the art and science of personalization.

And we went to a store that you know, has a big like piece of fruit hanging over it. And you gotta go in and you talk to these cool people. Yeah, and we could not get a new phone because we are ready to pay, we're ready to do everything. We could not do it because we couldn't turn off a feature called Find My iPhone. And it was pretty frustrating, you know, because I was \u2014 we were ready to rock. And he forgot his password. And it was a big deal. And I said, you know, and I was talking through this, with the nice rep was explaining it very nicely to me. And clearly. And I said, this is where security meets experience, you know, because Apple values security greatly.\\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/consumer-wants-privacy-transparency-online-security-better-customer-experience\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\" Security and privacy\\\"\\u003e Security and privacy\\u003c\/a\\u003e.

And it makes me think of how important it is to design for so many different aspects of how an experience can go. So it's easy to think about what you know, I might refer to as the happy path, and what your experience should have been getting the new phone, but I think it's the designers job really to think around like, what other turns might the customer take when trying to accomplish this task? What will they run into? And what are we going to do if that happens, and really thinking through those various scenarios and being very intentional about the path that ultimately helps to ensure that you're able to achieve what you're trying to do.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-experience\/the-role-of-data-privacy-in-customer-trust-and-brand-loyalty\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"The Role of Data Privacy in Customer Trust and Brand Loyalty\\\"\\u003eThe Role of Data Privacy in Customer Trust and Brand Loyalty\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eLeveraging Cross-Functional Teams for Customer-Centric Product Development\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eBy the way, I like dropped my job when I was talking to that rep.

That's why I know so much about this right? He wasn't impressed. He wasn't there. All right. And that takes us to topic number three, leveraging \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/the-power-of-customer-journey-analytics-cross-functional-teams\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"cross functional teams\\\"\\u003ecross functional teams\\u003c\/a\\u003e. We were talking about your team a little bit and what they value. And I think a lot of folks out there like okay, how do they get the job done? How do they do this? The cross functional team teams, that's a big part of this big part of your world, diving across different departments and figuring things out as a complete and utter whole unit. So the question would be like, what are some examples of leveraging the knowledge of a cross functional effort in addressing specific customer needs through that path.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJason:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e I\u2019m a huge believer in the power of cross functional teams and the proverbial wisdom of the crowd. And that's just a core to how Capital One operates. In software development, we often refer to the trifecta of product design and technology. I think that is actually much more complex than that, I think data science and marketing and operations and strategy, all coming to the table to helping achieve an objective is where I've seen this have the most success. Frankly, a few years ago, we were rethinking what it's like to be on boarded to a new credit card product. And we were really ready to tackle that because the nature of how people spend money has changed. Credit card companies used to really compete to be top of wallet. And that was almost like a literal meaning, that card most accessible in your wallet.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWell, you think about how the world has changed and how many transactions how much spending you do relative how many times you touch your credit card. Spending. Now being top of wallet takes on a whole different meaning. It's about your card being embedded in your web browser, it's being in your digital wallets. So the job that customers are really trying to do when they get new cards, is now integrate this new product into their life into their spending life. And so how our experience work needed to facilitate that. It's not enough just to get you a physical card in your mailbox, but really help you embed the card in a digital context. So that was really the challenge that we are tackling. And what we found that we needed to do was engage numerous teams from very different parts of the company to come together.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eEnterprise teams that are focused on consumer identity and protecting customer data and fraud teams who you know, helped to make sure that our customers money is safe and help where we make decisions about the legitimacy of transactions and accounts, the business teams, teams that run multiple channels of how we engage with customers, I mean, the count was probably half a dozen or higher of teams that had to come together within their own trifectas of how they work. What I found really is most critical when you recognize just how many teams are required to work together is you can't move too fast through setting the vision and getting people rallied around what we're trying to accomplish and bought into the purpose. That can't be something someone else does, and then brings over and expects everyone to fall in line like everyone needs to sort of be a part of shaping that you create a real vested interest and a common purpose that binds this very kind of massive cross functional team.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCross-Departmental Collaboration Varies with Product Lifecycle Stages\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e So if I were looking in your inbox, which cross department organization, and within Capital One would be taking up the most space, marketing, sales like, or is it a tie between a bunch of them?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eJason: Yeah, it's an interesting question. I would say, it sort of depends on the context. So to the extent we are engaging, and asking questions like, Hey, where's this business going? In three years? And how do we need to be thinking about the customer experience in a way that future proofs, the business, you know, you might have corporate strategy teams heavily engaged and running that in partnership with the business. And then in another context, it could be, hey, we've built this awesome travel product, and we're about to go to market and that might have a heavy marketing lean to it, along with the business and product team. So I think I would find that the composition and mix of cross functional collaboration might evolve based on where we are in the product development lifecycle.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCX and EX: How Employee Experience Shapes Product Design\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, and as you're talking through that, I'm thinking you know, a lot of experienced design leaders have \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/425651\/the-connection-between-ex-and-cx.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"CX and EX\\\"\\u003eCX and EX\\u003c\/a\\u003e under their title.

I'm really proud of the investment the Capital One makes in the associate experience the design team here is deeply engaged in multiple partnerships that are advancing differently, aspects of the the associate experience. So one in particular is really focused on our software engineers, who, by the way, are engaged everywhere across the product development lifecycle, helping to shape things as and certainly to delivering them. But there's such a critical job function that we're very focused on, do we have the optimal experience for that kind of work, and how to make the developers\u2019 experience better. And then that sits alongside partnerships with our Human Resources area, who are obsessing about what it's like to become an associate, and how to integrate and acclimate to this new environment, how to get set up in systems fast, so that you can feel like you're productive as early as possible. So when I zoom all the way out and look at all the things that the design team here is touching, many of them are focused on aspects of the associate experience,\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEmpowering Agents: Aligning Call Center Tech With Customer Needs\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e The good CX companies have to walk the walk with EX too, right? I think?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eJason: That couldn't be more true in the early days of our technology transformation, which has really been to rebuild and modernize how the company runs. Part of the legacy technology that we tackled was actually how the call center agent, or a branch or cafe ambassador, all the tools that they had to use to facilitate interactions with our customers that they're having face to face. And they were navigating numerous systems to do their job. And we recognize that their primary focus needed to be on what the customer on the other side of that phone call or on the other side of that desk needed. And we needed the software and the tools that they're using to do their job to facilitate that to enable that. So we rebuilt many systems that they used and collapsed them and really focused on making their lives easier, so they could focus on our customer.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article:\\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/contact-center\/top-call-center-technology-trends\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\" Top Call Center Technology Trends\\\"\\u003e Top Call Center Technology Trends\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDesign's Bottom Line: Linking Improvements to Business Outcomes\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e All right, that was topic three, talking about leveraging cross functional teams, let's move on to the final topic here, kind of bringing it all home and we're talking about the very fun topic of \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/experience-is-the-method-outcomes-are-the-goal\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"business outcomes\\\"\\u003ebusiness outcomes\\u003c\/a\\u003e, you know, the things that the board members ask you about?

And what I think is a really important challenge facing design as an industry, I think it's critical that designers understand the connection between what they're working on, and the choices they make, about how something should work or how something should be designed. And the connection it has to the underlying business dynamics at play. Sometimes that's about driving revenue, through deeper engagement with the company, sometimes that's making the cost structure that it takes to deliver experiences more efficient, whatever it is understanding the business dynamics at play, not to the degree that you are a business analyst, we're not asking that it's about having kind of a sufficient understanding about the relationship. Because design meetings are so much more powerful and effective with business leaders, when you're talking about like \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-marketing\/navigating-the-c-suite-disconnect-in-customer-marketing\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"C-suite and our board\\\"\\u003eC-suite and our board\\u003c\/a\\u003e, when you make very clear the connection between the decisions, maybe as something as detailed as how a screen is compiled, and the intentionality between that back to the underlying business dynamics. And oftentimes, I find that these connections exist, and it's just about highlighting them. And being intentional about that being as top of mind or how we communicate the great work that we're doing.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCore Principles in Experience Design\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e So I'd love to just bring this all home. And I always like to ask like, hey, getting started, what's the message to someone who's pretty new at experience design? And they just got named that role? They're building their team? What are the core principles that apply to Capital One? Or the bakery? How about that and bring it a tie in death? Down the street? What are the core principles to be thinking about when it comes to experience design bringing this all together?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eJason:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I mean, I think I would pick up where we were just leaving off I think having a real understanding for the relationship between the experience which is what you're setting out to be accountable for and to be the thing that you're obsessing about, while other folks may be focused on other parts of the business, but understanding the relationship between the experience and other domains, so the relationship to the business the relationship Up to the choices the engineering teams might be facing about what systems to invest in, and what capabilities to build or not. There's also\\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/bridging-the-empathy-gap-with-customers\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\" a best practice of the empathy that we apply to our end users\\\"\\u003e a best practice of the empathy that we apply to our end users\\u003c\/a\\u003e, whether those are associates or end customers. I think applying that to internal partners is also a powerful understanding in your stakeholder ecosystem, whatever you're doing, everyone has things that are accountable to are largely everybody's trying to do their best. And really understanding where people are coming from. And applying that power of understanding and putting yourself in someone else's shoes is critically important to apply internally, particularly when you're new to a role and one of design superpowers is creating alignment and facilitation across multiple areas towards a common goal. And I think focusing on the big problems that are ahead \u2014 that\u2019s where there's a bunch of customer pain or a bunch of business upside, and just ruthlessly prioritizing and applying those skills is where you can have the most impact.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eAnd to top this all off, no pun intended, what's the best cake combo from a professional baker?

I'm Dom Nicastro, managing editor for CMSWire.com. And we are joined today by my new friend who I actually met in person. It's a new world, and I get to see these human faces in person again, and it was awesome. We met a couple of weeks ago at the time of this recording in May, at the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/connect\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"CMSWire Connect conference\\\"\\u003eCMSWire Connect conference\\u003c\/a\\u003e in Austin, Texas.

I actually live in Austin. So it was a very quick commute for me to get to your conference.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah. Let's see. So you said it's a good day. Does that mean the bats are alive and well and flying under that \u2014 what is it the Congress Street Bridge or something?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e It\u2019s Congress Street Bridge. Probably the bats are alive and well. When there are lots of mosquitoes though sometimes I don't want them to be so alive and well. I mean, like great, just not by me, please.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I was shocked. I was shocked at the passion that the residents and natives that I met in Austin, Texas, had for these bats. This is the new Silicon Valley we're talking about. Right? Austin, Texas. This is the place where they have some of the best food in the world. We're so close to Mexico, we have all this history and culture. Yeah. But did you see our bats?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e We're a little batty for bats. It's true.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eMan, well, let's get batty for CX, shall we? Yeah. So let's start here, though, you know, I know about you, because I met you a couple of weeks ago. But I would love our audience to get a little insight on the career for you and your trajectory and how you kind of ended up in this CX leadership role at TurboTax.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e I've been in CX in some way, shape or form my whole life. I kind of laugh because my first job out of college, my title was letter writer. And I responded to customer letters for the president and CEO of this bank. And this was like way back in the day when you could still smoke in the office and all that stuff, like totally Mad Men. And so it just kind of went from there.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eI did a stint at what is now \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.corelogic.com\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"CoreLogic\\\"\\u003eCoreLogic\\u003c\/a\\u003e, wound up being a marketing director for them for a while, had kids, ran my own consulting business doing CX types of things for different companies, and then got back into the work world full time, like full bore in the startup space.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd that was a whole new world for me, moving that fast. And that's really where I cut my teeth on this \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.gregkihlstrom.com\/theagilebrandpodcast\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"concept of agile CX\\\"\\u003econcept of agile CX\\u003c\/a\\u003e was in that and worked for, you know, different \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/building-the-best-customer-success-team\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"customer success\\\"\\u003ecustomer success\\u003c\/a\\u003e and CX roles and then got recruited by Intuit, and it popped up on my LinkedIn profile, you know, the little message pops up. And I'm like, ah, the recruiter, you know, that got this message from this recruiter out of the blue. And so I read the job description. And I'm \u2014 I replied so fast that the recruiter, are you sure did you like actually read it? I'm like, oh, yeah. Everything in here is like my dream job. You know, sign me up now, man. And so that's how it happened.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIt was the world's fastest interview process. I was actually talking to another large, really well-known company. And they were just so slow on the uptake that Intuit just beat them all hollow, rapid interview with my now boss sitting in an airport giving me the final interview. They made the offer the next day, and I have been a happy clam ever since.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Nice. Every tax year. You've been a happy clam. That's great. And how many years now? How many tax years has it been? We were speaking tax terms? OK.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Only two tax seasons. And yes, everything is actually measured in my life, not just by the tax season, but as we call them peaks, is it first peak is it second peak? And then third peak in October when everybody finishes their extension? So are we you know, I get all my early testing done in that time period.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAgile CX: Transforming Customer Experience With Data-Based Pivots\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, you talked in Austin at CMSWire Connect about that very topic, \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-marketing\/growing-beyond-agile-adaptability-for-todays-marketing-landscape\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"agile CX\\\"\\u003eagile CX\\u003c\/a\\u003e, I think that's a good place to start, you know, how would you define agile CX I'm sure people in the business world obviously know the term \u201cagile\u201d but when you apply to CX, what are you talking about there?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e it actually applies very closely adhering to the principles that the original dudes who came up with the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/agilemanifesto.org\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Agile Manifesto for software development\\\"\\u003eAgile Manifesto for software development\\u003c\/a\\u003e, it really applies to that. So it used to be, you'd have your big marketing plan, and you would execute on it to heaven and earth to be able to move things quickly.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn contrast, in agile, I'm going to really found on what my customers problem is, but I'm going to operate really, really quickly. So just like in software development, where they tend to operate now, you know, if you're an agile organization, it's the same thing and CX, so I can have a plan, right, but I'm going to break it up into bite-sized chunks.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd if I'm going along, and the data comes back differently, or, you know, something indicates that I need to take a different direction. I can pivot extremely rapidly, like sometimes daily, I can pivot which way I'm going. So we had a recent campaign that is related to one of our additional products. And we met every single day, we met with our partners who were running the experts, most of our product experts are not employees, but they're seasonal employees.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so we have some partners that we've worked with for many, many years and understand our needs. And we have repeat people come back season after season after season. So we met with them. I'm meeting with learning and development, we're interviewing the experts, we\u2019re listening in on customer phone calls, we're tweaking training as we go, I actually came up with some TikToks, some roleplay. To address different needs, there's really it's a super fast, really quick process, where you're checking the data, every single day, here's where we think we want, you know, we're aiming at landing, here's where we actually are landing, is it better or worse baseline? What changes do we need to make?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so in a matter of four weeks, we ran through a complete experiment process. And actually, I'm working with the design team to implement some tooling inside our \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/understanding-customer-relationship-management-crm-the-basics-and-beyond\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"CRM\\\"\\u003eCRM\\u003c\/a\\u003e, because we're going to roll this to baseline across our organization come October. So that's super fast, not how it used to be.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-experience\/agility-is-no-longer-optional-in-business\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Agility Is No Longer Optional in Business\\\"\\u003eAgility Is No Longer Optional in Business\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eTurning Giant Corporations Agile: It Starts with People and Speed\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, four weeks is like four seconds in the business world, like you're trying to get people convinced on something that the data is telling you about your customers. And that takes four months sometimes. Right? I mean, I'm sure you've been at businesses before this, where you're like, oh, this would have taken me a half a year.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eOh, yeah. Oh, for sure. And that really is a change in perspective. And that if you're going to do agile, you're not going to have it all nailed down, like 70% certainty. Woohoo, let's move. And that was a real shift for me. Moving from more of a standard corporate mindset, I was in banking forever. OK, you know, so it was like, everything was so tightly controlled. There\u2019s a lot of nos. It's very much command and control structure. Super customer oriented, very command and control.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo I go from that into startup world, run this series of very agile companies. And then I think, Oh, well, it's probably going to slow down when I go down to it. Whoa, this is the fastest, biggest 40-year old startup I\u2019ve ever been in. There is no waiting around, which both makes it really fun and can be a challenge if it's not a type of working style that you're used to.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd even though I was used to moving fast, this was still even faster, right? One-hundred days in the tax season. I have a very limited time to get a lot of goodness in. And so even for myself, I had to go oh, I can't wait till next week. I have to do this today before I can leave my desk, I have to get this done, I have to get this data, I have to get analyze it, I have to decision, I have to get my stakeholders on board. Whereas before I could be like, I got a couple of weeks to do that.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eSo getting to the point where you can make at this big corporation, this big startup, if you will, you can make decisions that are impactful, but also take only about a month to do maybe even less, two weeks, let's say, how do we get to that point, because people in the crowd at CMSWire Connect when you were giving this talk, I'm sure they're like, hey, we want to be agile, too. But we have all these blockers and this, there's always excuses of not to start. So my question to you is you've done it successfully with your teams. Where do you start? Like, where's the first place? Is it the people? Is it the hiring? Is it the tools to infuse this agility into your organization.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eSo if you have the ability, if you're situated in your organization, where you can drive agility from the top down, there's one set of answers. And if you are in a place where you're going to have to drive agility from the bottom up, so to speak, there's another set of answers, but they both truly start in the same place. And that's with people. If you have people who are going to be resistant to moving fast, you can't train that out of them.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd I had long conversations with one of my CEOs who had worked in different large insurance companies that run operations for USAA. And it was such a, I would still I would walk on broken glass for this guy, Steve, I love you. He\u2019s so awesome. Love you, Steve. We talked about this a lot because he had an experience where they tried to change the culture of an organization to be agile, and it went so far as to create almost a mirror organization. And the original Goliath eventually ate the small David. So he was really depressed about that, how can I ever change culture, if it's created in that way, I can't push it forward. And so if you find if you're a leader, and you're in an organization, where you're trying to, to turn the ship of state, there will be people who are ready, and they are ready to go with you. And then there will be other people that you'll need to put in places where they're going to be happy. And limited. Or, you know, maybe I hate to say it, but maybe it's not a fit for them in the long term. And that really is a case by case basis for each individual company.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIf you're going to get your hiring profile right, you want people who are going to be really empathetic and customer oriented and have extreme ownership. Because with agile, everything that you do isn\u2019t going to come down from above. I think about it, we talked about the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.technologynetworks.com\/informatics\/news\/the-deep-neural-network-of-ai-that-misleads-results-374252\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"neural networks in AI\\\"\\u003eneural networks in AI\\u003c\/a\\u003e and how you have this self organizing almost group of nodes, right. And that's what agile is, in a company that does it well.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo it means as a leader, I can't control everything. I'm going to make my North Star, very clear. I'm going to make sure I have the right people. And maybe I need to do a personality test. I think it was Office Depot. But iI could be wrong, who was trying to change some culture. had everybody in the company do a Myers Briggs, and found that most people were saying, you know, answering the question like no, I don't want to work with customers, who are their frontline people. That's all I got.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-experience\/failing-at-agile-youre-doing-it-wrong\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Failing at Agile?

And the guy says, Hey, you owe this whole customer thing. I'm not going to quite do that part of the job, but I'll do anything else.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, I'll do it. Right, right. So it's like no, like, of course, you don't necessarily want your engineers customer facing, but you want them to be able to understand the customer pain or problems or whatever that drives it. So if you've got you know, your North Star, you've looked at your people. And then you have to make it safe to experiment and to learn and that means to fail.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah. And so, you know, we're talking about agile being great and good all the time. However, do you have any examples of like, moving too fast? Maybe like, right, like, yeah, you know, like, hey, it's great that we rolled this TikTok campaign out in 24 hours. But how did it do? Right? If you can think of any examples like that, that'd be great. Because there\u2019s cautions here, this cautionary tales, I'm sure.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, we were anxious to move a proactive experience where we were offering help to customers that at times, we thought they needed it. And it made sense, you know, the face of it, of course, but we moved quick, I'm gonna guess we didn't do the in depth, follow me homes and customer research, we were super, super fast. And when we got to the end of it, we put a lot of resources, we staffed it, specially. I had special cues and specially trained experts and changed our learning and development programs, and how we handled next best action guidance. And we got to the end of the season. And when all that was a bust. Like, like that didn't do anything. And so in the retro it's why, why did that not do anything? And what were the surprise was is it was a bust? But it's not a bust, and that we got some really good learnings out of it. Don't do that things that way.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, you have the model of failure. And because you were able to use Sprint's use agile so fast that you rolled it out and said, All right, well, it didn't work. Next time, we're going to maybe change it up a little bit. So yeah, so you have that data now?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah. Why don't we actually did change it up during the season? Well, let's tweak this thing. And see, no. We're humans are funny creatures. Sometimes we get it wrong.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes the data just gives you the answer. Right? So those metrics, like what are the primary metrics you're staring at, you know, each day to help infuse and empower your agile methodologies? What are you looking at mostly? What type of tool are you using to get all this great data from all these consumers using TurboTax. And the other properties?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eWell, my favorite most used metric, I should say, is \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.hotelnewsresource.com\/article126736.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"NPS\\\"\\u003eNPS\\u003c\/a\\u003e. And that is both on a transactional level, as well as when you finish using the product. We also collect some sentiment data in the middle of the experience that we've leveraged very effectively, and there's even more goodness to get in there. And we're, I'm, you know, looking at expanding that we use it some is to expand more into the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/datadecisionmakers\/how-to-design-cx-that-saves-money-and-minimizes-customer-effort\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"customer effort score\\\"\\u003ecustomer effort score\\u003c\/a\\u003e, and then partner that with \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbestechcouncil\/2022\/11\/23\/emotion-ai-why-its-the-future-of-digital-health\/?sh=36bd21796516\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"emotional AI\\\"\\u003eemotional AI\\u003c\/a\\u003e, to really give what I think will be a tight retention indicator that I can get in front of, you know, taxes are emotional.

Okay. Sometimes it makes you happy. Sometimes it makes you nervous. I mean, you're right. It's that emotional connection to that number. And as you're going along what it's doing and the ups and downs, right? I've been using TurboTax for almost 10 years now. And you know that you probably checked it before you got on the podcast.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e No, no, that\u2019s private, Dom.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e That's right. I'm just a number. My social, by the way, is .... So tell me, tell me, but it's like, you're right. And something you said I wanted to jump in because you said emotional AI. So I want to know what that looks like in practice, because it's all the buzz obviously. So when you are leveraging emotionally I what does that look like? What does that mean?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eSo still in the process of it. So I don't have a lot of data. This is my passion project right now, way, way back. I looked into this, like in 2015. When these models were just getting off the ground, but what it looks like and there are several companies who excel at this and they all have a little different spin on it. So they can use facial mapping. They can use voice analysis that focuses on tone and resonance and literally what vibration are you at? There are ones that you can really get into If you're gonna do this, like in an experimental level where you can hook people up to things that measure the moisture in their skin and their heart rate, all of that stuff that really invasive level of emotional monitoring has been around for some time. But it's only been used in panels or specific cases where somebody has said, yes, yes, you can do this to me, right.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut at scale, what it can look like is, I'm going to listen to what you're saying and how you're saying it, if you dial in, I'm going to analyze what you select, we actually ask people in that product, how you feeling? And then we give them the opportunity to tell us, right, and it's the smiley frowny face kind of thing. And then if they want to give us more information, there's little pills that they can click on as to why or they can leave us verbatim. And then we actually call those people back. Not all of them, not all of them, that would be a lot. We do have different standards as to what is actionable and what is not actionable. We actually call them back to say, Hey, we got your survey, that you're not feeling so great about your taxes, can I support you in any way? And people are like, what you're kidding me? Wow.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYou should partner up with \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/research\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Johns Hopkins\\\"\\u003eJohns Hopkins\\u003c\/a\\u003e or something, you know, you gotta have some therapeutic services from the best of the business. After you do taxes, everyone needs a little therapy. Instead, you have your wonderful contact center, people calling, which is they do a great job, too. I would imagine,\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYou know, I because of my job and probably for you to most people in this CX space, though we love, love, love all the kudos.

So I dig into that, but our experts, when we actually have a connection with a customer, because clearly we don't talk to everybody, not everybody calls us I mean, goodness, I was a TurboTax customer for something like 20 years before I called in, I just didn't need to call. It was pretty easy. Which is the ideal, right?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/digital-experience\/kinder-ai-in-the-contact-center-best-ways-to-improve-your-ai-customer-support\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Kinder AI in the Contact Center: Best Ways to Improve Your AI Customer Support\\\"\\u003eKinder AI in the Contact Center: Best Ways to Improve Your AI Customer Support\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eProactive CX Approach Can Boost Retention\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah. That\u2019s pretty proactive CX, that's pretty powerful. You don't hear that a lot where, hey, we get some sentiment analysis, and we follow up with actual phone calls to these human beings. That's a pretty powerful initiative to do that. What have been the returns on that one? I mean, do you get a lot of feedback on the phone calls? Like, now you're like feedback upon the \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/5-ways-to-optimize-your-customer-feedback-program\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"feedback\\\"\\u003efeedback\\u003c\/a\\u003e kind of thing?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Oh, yes. Not only do we analyze the recordings, right, because every phone call is monitored and recorded. Unless the customer says don't, of course, caveat. So we can analyze that we get NPS scores for the interaction with the expert after that. And we leverage all that to say, Hey, are we on target? Are we not? So we had a goal before this project was launched, which we exceeded. So it had about a 5% increase in retention for those who were included in it. Right. So obviously, we\u2019ve expanded and it\u2019s still going on.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eCool. So what's the moment of relief for you guys? You get the extension season?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eOh, man. That's a good question. I had thought of my first season, right? It's like, Rudy, you said, All Marietta, you know, we all get to relax a little bit. You take a breath after season. And it ends, you know, the April filing deadline comes and goes, Man, it hasn't slowed down yet, Rudy. It's like the false peak when you're a runner and you think you hit the top? No, no, this is not the top yet because as soon as season ends, then everyone dives in to indices and learnings.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhat did we learn? What surprised us? What questions did we think we're going to get answered but didnt? But those are actually my two favorite things from retros. And then maybe, you know, maybe a little bit in June and July, people take vacation. The crazy thing, though, is that for as fast as you work, it's fun. Because you see, this is the beauty of agile you see very quickly the impact that you had as a one human that you have on how people all got their job done of taxes, right? So you literally made a difference in a very tangible way to people's lives. That feels great because that's what gets me up in the morning. And then you also see how it benefited the company overall. So it's a win-win, there's something fun about getting scrappy.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/is-your-organizations-digital-customer-experience-proactive-or-reactive\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Is Your Organization\u2019s Digital Customer Experience Proactive or Reactive?\\\"\\u003eIs Your Organization\u2019s Digital Customer Experience Proactive or Reactive?\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAgile CX Approach Launches New TurboTax Feature in Two Weeks\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e I would say so yeah. If you could think of the ultimate example of where agile kicked in for you guys. And you know, whether it was a few years ago this year, where something told you that you needed to adapt pretty fast. And I know you told us a little bit earlier, some stories, some anecdotes, but is there that one that stands out for you? And if so, if there's that one shining moment, where it kind of all came together? And how did you get to that point? Is there a moment like that for you in your CX team?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eFor me, personally, it really was doing, launching that mid-product survey experience. First, I thought, Oh, I had a couple of months to do it. I was brand spanking new, I got a couple of months. And then I looked on a spreadsheet, my name showed up. And I realized, oh, I don't have a couple of months, I have four, I have four weeks, OK? And then I readjusted my perspective, and I thought, well, I bet I can beat that. So I launched it in two weeks, I got off the ground and VP. And I do remember the moment where it flipped inside me. And I was like, I don't care whose job it is, I'm gonna fill the gap. I'm going to ping the project manager, I'm going to talk to the partner, I'm going to make it happen, I'm going to own this thing.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd I do remember pulling my boss and my director, and Monday morning when I realized like, oh, we have a little bit of time. I just looked at him. And I said, I'm committed to beating this deadline. So let's get aligned and make it happen. And it was a blast. But agile into it. Oh my goodness, that that goes back, honestly, to the very beginning with Scott Cook, they've really always worked that way before agile was the thing they worked that way, if you look and Scott Cook's original business plan, he's like measuring the data. Here's, here's what we're aiming for, for timesavers because Quicken was the original product, here's where we're going.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd then they worked and worked and worked, they solve the big hairy problem, got the MVP out there. And it was incredibly fast that they became the market leader. And how what had happened was they had a home product that they were asking people, how are you utilizing this product at that, you know, like Where where are you utilizing it. And people kept saying they were using it at work. And they thought, well, they must be doing their personal finances in the office or something, have a home office, and found out that that wasn't the case. It was a bunch of regular people, small business owners who didn't understand debit and credit accounting. So they used, you know, the Intuit product. And out of the curiosity of why are people saying that the expansion, all the various products that Intuit has created and built over the years really came from those principles that Scott Cook laid out, probably when I was a child.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBalancing Agile Innovation with Consistency in Customer Experience\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eRight? I think this kind of brings everything together this question, you know, because there's always the balancing act of the desire to roll things out fast and be quick and be ahead of competitors, with the urge to stay with the tried and true that your data tells you works every year. So I guess to kind of bring it all home, how do you go about balancing that need for agility, and experimentation with maintaining all that consistency and continuity in the customer experience that your consumers and prospects have come to expect?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, when you read a newspaper, you can read any newspaper across the US. And they're all going to have the same basic serif font with a large cap that tells you this is the beginning of the paragraph. And they're all going to have the same basic typesetting and you probably don't notice it, or you probably do, Dom, but most people don't notice it.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIt's almost invisible. But it's very purposeful. And it has trained us. It's like the grammar, or the etiquette of how newspapers work, and Apple did the same kind of thing, they came up with this etiquette, well, Intuit has this internal product etiquette that everything has to adhere to. So we keep it in that space for customers.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo when you come in, you don't go, oh, my you totally redone everything, I can't find the button anymore. Right? So that's very intentional, and the customer focus that is embedded at every level, like, you can hardly have a business meeting without saying, what's the customer problem we're solving, let's get crisp on that. What is the thing and it's truly incorporated in everything. So in that process, where you're prototyping with customers, you're observing them, you're keeping yourself out of the process, you're really truly observing how they get the job done of doing taxes, you see, if they compensate for something, that to them, that seems really natural and logical, you know, how they're doing it.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd you know, it's like five steps that they don't need to do. So we get in front of that stuff that pain. And we do, ask ourselves, what will the impact be on the customer? Will they have to do anything different? Are they gaining? Are they going to in any way lose any functionality or capability, or anything that they're used to having? So there was a product that people use to track their donations and different things like that expenses, and it's a little freebie, and we were gonna sunset it. We didn't think it drove that much value. Boy, we heard back.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eThat's the best customer experience test right there. Take something away, and really see what your feedback you get you. Sometimes you solicit feedback, right? You email them, you call them, you make them do a survey. Well, hey, let's just good old fashioned, rip it apart, and then see what happens.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Well, we just said, Hey, we're gonna take it away.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Oh, OK. You want?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Yeah, yeah, that that ended very quickly. And it's still there to this day operating away. Happily.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDeveloping Successful CX Strategies\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah. And that's probably an example of, like you said earlier, we didn't take ourselves out of it. We saw something that we think needed to go away because it wasn't provided. I'm sure the analytics were there. Right, the ROI wasn't there. You know, that kind of thing. But you had that customer demand, nope, nope, nope? No, keep it and you're like, okay,\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarietta: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eOK.

That's pretty impressive. Okay, good. Well, the good news is we got very affable guests here with us to put us all at ease and talk about high level customer experience stuff because this guy has the background for it. He's been there done that. Today, we are going to be joined by Cary Cusumano, former customer experience design consultant at Verizon, spending good chunk of his time now, as a CMSWire contributor. Cary, welcome.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary Cusumano: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eHey, Dom, it's always nice to be with you guys.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSarah:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Cary, I'm happy because you're one of the contributors that I found. So it's great to have you. Yes, yes. And I hear you're going to be talking about what's in your CX toolbox. And before we get into the world of CX, we do want to know more about you. So what are you focusing on right now in CX? And what are your past roles that led you to where you are today.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eMy hope here from this podcast is that a couple of takeaways will be just key attributes that a CX professional will want to have in their toolbox. Not necessarily the the actual tools themselves, but the capabilities or the skills that they want to take away with themselves. So hopefully, I'll leave a little bit of that for your audience.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd people will be interested in finding out more to answer your second question. Basically, I started out in the United States Navy was my first quote unquote real job, where I qualified in submarines and ultimately became a chief engineer in the nuclear power plant. So it felt to me like my first move into the civilian world was a natural, windowed stay in engineering and operations. And that's kind of what I did. I worked at a company that's no longer in existence called MCI, telecom company. But the key there was these were roles that were, again, engineering, network design, network implementation, video conferencing, things like that. But you know what the other thing that I found here, Sarah, was where I learned the most about the business was in some chief of staff roles, where now you're seeing everything across marketing and finance, and HR, et cetera.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd in those roles, one thing that started to come to the fore, in my mind was seeing the same types of issues arise over and over and I developed a curiosity to kind of say, Why did these same things keep happening, whether that was in finance, or whether it was in a technical area, problem solving, Eric troubleshooting for the customers, there just seem to be the same types of issues that were process related. And so one of the things that I that I actually have, that personally, I like, is the investigative aspect of problem solving. So it's this notion of trying to dig under why things happen. And I guess when you combine these elements here, it really became a foundational core of what I think is a key attribute for CX professionals that haven't that's just a general curiosity about why and then that persistence in the investigation of why processes go sideways.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eAnd once again, we have a CX leader, who took such a traditional route to the CX path, the Navy, right? Isn't that, it's fascinating to me, we've had architects, we've had engineers, math whiz, and all of a sudden, they end up as CX leaders like I find this so fascinating, by the way, thank you for your service, number one. And number two, how does that path emerge, It's nuts?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e It's funny that you probably hear me chuckle because I remember one comment from one of my commanding officers at one point, he said, originality is neither required nor desired. And I was a little bit of resistant to that notion, but I guess when you're operating a nuclear power plant, you want to stick to the rules that would be fundamental.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYou would think so. Cool. Yeah. Always be in monitor there for sure. All right. So let's get into the talk. So you know, talking about the CX toolbox for practical measurable outcomes, the key attributes of CX professional needs for success. So question number one, you began your career with several operations engineering, even chief of staff of roles, again, getting into this whole evolution into CX, what was the true spark that led you to CX management?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Like I said, in those particular roles, what I found was a recurrence of the same types of problems that got me looking at this notion of continuous process management, particularly in the field that I studied was in Lean Six Sigma, you could be in TQM, total quality management, could be Lean Six Sigma, it doesn't matter, the method, as long as you have some type of focus on continuous process improvement. And so I basically went and became a certified Lean Six Sigma, but though, using those skills to try and get underneath why things were happening, and actually solve problems once you understand the root causes.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/align-your-voice-of-the-customer-initiative-with-your-customers\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Align Your Voice of the Customer Initiative With Your Customers\\\"\\u003eAlign Your Voice of the Customer Initiative With Your Customers\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDecoding the Value of 'Voice of the Customer' in Business Success\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSarah: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, and I definitely agree, there's certainly, you know, enormous value to businesses that practice these sorts of process improvements. But that doesn't sound like it's exactly CX. So could you connect the dots a little bit more for us,\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eSara, with the hard hitting questions, usually, yeah, but is it CX related, dude, I love it.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, it's a good question. It's a fair question, Sarah. And the reality is that there's essentially in a Lean Six Sigma project, you have five phases. And the first of those phases is called the Define Phase, which is really about justifying why you're going to enter into a project in the first place.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOne of the things I learned from one of my trainers was the question of the Define Phase is what is important. And so obviously, there is a financial element to entering any type of particular process improvement project, whether that's a cost savings, focus, whether it's a revenue, uplift focus. But one of the other elements that had to be done was this notion, again, at the time, I was learning this notion of what is voice the customer, and voice the customer to us at the time really amounted to some survey scores, we were getting Net Promoter scores for various elements or aspects of the service that we were delivering. Occasionally, you would get a verbatim response that helped you get a little bit underneath it. But to us, that's what voice of the customer was.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut it was essential as a part of justifying why he's particularly did a project. And the problem that I noticed, again, after having done several projects was at the end of a project. We were always asked, How much money did you save or how much revenue? But we were never asked, How did this \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2023\/03\/using-technology-to-create-a-better-customer-experience\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"improve the customer experience\\\"\\u003eimprove the customer experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e. And of course, there was a small team of us, I would say, maybe three of us at most, who walked away with the same thought that this notion of voice the customer, we believe in it.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut it seems like it was a slide on your define meeting that got promptly shoved in a drawer and forgotten about. And so the three of us essentially made it our mission to raise awareness for this notion of voice of the customer and make ourselves experts in analyzing it, I guess then that might actually include a second attribute, which would be, let's start with voice of the customer as the centerpiece of anything we're doing that affects the customer experience.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e So with those folks, you know, in the past, who were talking about the financial aspect, and oh, what was the financial outcome of this? How much did we make? How much do we save? Were you able to convince those folks eventually, about the customer experience, impact and get them to be sort of believers in that and not hitting in the drawer, as you said, and how so if you were able to convince them to buy in there?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e You know, Dom, I think that we eventually did, but it wasn't like an overnight thing. It was something that took us a little bit of time. And it really, I think grew out of this small cadre of folks who again, we made it our mission, to bring this notion of voice of the customer to the fore. One of my colleagues, for example, he decided to make himself an expert on survey design, because, as you guys know, this particular audience, that you have your time as well knows that, oftentimes, that's how you ask the question on a survey that's important.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHe went off to Medallia as a consultant there and became an expert on survey design, and sharing his knowledge with clients of his own. A second colleague in this small group of ours, she went on to Verizon, executive response team, and basically you and I know that when I send a complaint letter to the CEO of, let's say, Navy Federal Credit Union, for example, which I did at one point, they never see that. It really goes to a small team.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd this is what my colleague was doing was receiving and reading customer complaint letters, and she got to a point where the volume was so high, she needed to give herself a tool to sift through that data at a little higher volume. So she began to make herself an expert in text more Particularly with Clarabridge, some of your audience may be familiar with that tool doesn't matter again, what the tool was. This is what she used to become an expert in text analytics and start to find patterns.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eNow, for myself, I went to a conference where I saw a gentleman from General Motors speak named David Mingle. And this became, I think, a turning point in where I wanted to make myself an expert. He talked about how Mary Barra, their CEO would spend about an hour each week, listening to customer calls and their call center, listen them directly.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd that way, she got to hear firsthand, the voice of the customer, literally the voice that customer not only reading it on paper, this prompted me to say, Listen, you know, we record every one of our calls in our service centers. But our executive management team was not co-located with a call center, there was no way to get them into there. So I thought, maybe I can bring it to them. So I made myself an expert on the voice analytics, and I was using Verint. Again, there's a number of tools out there, but again, using the analytical capability of this voice software, to dig deeper into why customers were calling in the first place.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSarah: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eSo as someone who's not a sales professional, I'm always on the opposite side of customer business interactions, like I am always the customer, I'm never the provider. And sometimes it feels like these businesses can forget that they're also customers. So do you think today's practitioners still have to make a case for voice of the customer? Or do you think times have changed in most corporate environments?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYou know, Sarah, I think it's even more important now. I don't know what to attribute it to, I don't know whether the COVID pandemic has become an easy scapegoat for a lot of issues. But I am finding, and I don't know if you are as well, that customer service, and customer experience in general has declined over the last few years. I feel like brands are much more married to the process than they are to the customer themselves.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd so you'll find this, again, I mentioned having to write to the CEO of Navy Federal Credit Union because I had an important check held up, which I needed to close on a house purchase, and it was going to cause me to be delayed, when I called into the service center, it really reduced to sorry, nothing we can do. That's the process, you're just gonna have to wait it out. And at the end of the day, what ended up happening was, sure enough, I got a call from somebody in their executor response team says, I've already got your problem solved.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWell, if you think about it, Sarah, anybody could have solved that problem. If those frontline service people were empowered to solve it. This is where again, I think, Sarah, that this notion of process, or customers has taken hold, had these people been empowered to solve the problem in the first place. They knew what exactly needed to be done. They just weren't empowered as the frontline service people to do that.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo I sympathize with you, I've experienced it myself, you bring to mind something that a colleague of mine says, says Cary why do people behave differently in the office than they do at home? And what he means is exactly what you just said, Sarah, is when we're the recipient of the experience, we recognize a bad one immediately. But when we're on the business side delivering it, we kind of get a little bit of a cognitive dissonance about that.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/9-enterprise-voice-of-the-customer-voc-tools-you-should-know-about\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"10 Voice of the Customer Tools to Maximize Customer Experience\\\"\\u003e10 Voice of the Customer Tools to Maximize Customer Experience\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eUnraveling Customer Journey: Root Cause Analysis Drives CX and Saves Money\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSarah:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Right? No, I completely agree. And it seems like as well, the voice of the customer is a big undertaking, because I recently wrote an article for CMSWire, about customer metrics. And it seems like there's so many volumes of data that can just be overwhelming. And you might not know where to begin when you have to start addressing customer needs. So I was wondering, how do you solve that problem? Can you solve that problem?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eWell,Sarah, it's a legitimate question, because it's one thing to be, you know, reviewing survey responses. And you know, one of the reasons that this small team of us moved beyond just surveys was listen, what do you do with an eight? What do you do with a six? What do you do with a four? The number itself doesn't help you understand what is underneath this? And this is why, you know, again, the three of us gravitated toward things that I will call this unstructured, and particularly unsolicited voice of the customer, this notion that customers when they're answering the survey that you've sent them, they're really just responding to something that you think is important, but when they're calling and when their email or know when they're chatting online. That's what's on their mind.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd it gets to the core of the question that you're asking here is, boy, now you're dealing with large volumes, because at best, you should be delighted if you get a 5% response rate on customer surveys. Many people just you know, give them wave of the hand and pass them off. But of course, if you're recording all your calls, if you're keeping a log of all your chat transcripts, you have 100% of that data and is a very powerful source of data from which you can find those root causes we talked about earlier.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBy the way, now, this reminds me this, this becomes probably another attribute that I would say a CX professional has to have met is go beyond just the traditional methods of looking at surveys, or maybe even reading some verbatim comments on those surveys, go out and find the unstructured the unsolicited sources that will give you a large volume and very meaningful data to work from. Now, going deeper into your question. What had happened was, and this goes back Dom to a question you asked earlier, how did you get the executives on board, what I was doing with this information was, I learned quickly that you don't have to bother with a five minute call, that's probably a password reset, you're not bothered with a 10 minute call, that's an address change or something like that.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYou had to suffer through the 45 minute call or the hour and 15 minute long call, to really understand why the customer was experiencing pain, that's where the pain really was, was in these long ones, where it became a dialogue back and forth. You know, and recognizing that you're trying to get this in front of an executive, you're not going to share an hour and 15 minutes with the call up.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut I was condensing them, clipping them down to about two or three minute segments, sharing them with executives, and the rest of my colleagues within the team. And then one day, one of those particular calls I shared, my friend who had gone over the to the executive response team, she called me up and she said, Cary, this is crazy. Because remember, you know, we had tens of thousands of business customers in Verizon, she said, Cary, I have an email from this exact same customer that you just sent the cal on. And we just said, you know, that's kind of funny. Wouldn't it be neat if we could sort of reconstruct their journey from other sources of voice of the customer.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd sure enough, we found out, by the way, that the call that I found was not the first call that that customer made they actually called another center, we found a few points of data within our operating support systems and were able to kind of reconstruct that customer's actual journey, not typical journey map, which again, it's very important and needed in business. But this was the actual journey that this particular customer experienced. It was something that, again, this notion of having a persistence in investigation led me to say, you know, what are the places can we look at, we can look at social media, we can look at Better Business Bureau reports, we can look at chat transcripts, we can look at emails, we can also go look in our own CRMs. And we can look in our trouble management systems, our billing system to find out the elements that even when the customer didn't know it, were affecting their journey.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo I think what this enabled us to do was isolate root causes through the reconstruction of these actual journeys. And I'll give you an example how that happened. Many of the calls that I heard, had a common theme, and that was I've got a bill that I don't recognize. And a lot of businesses might say, Okay, let's start a project, we have the root cause here billing clarity and billing accuracy. But by reconstructing the actual journey, yet till you got to a root cause it had nothing to do with billing.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn fact, one of the cases was, we had a third party vendor operating on our behalf. That was selling services to customers that weren't compatible with their equipment. And again, it was just a simple mistake, they didn't know. But we changed the process for that vendor. And guess what just happened there, Dom and Sarah, you took the root cause away? And how many calls did we get after that? Zero, multiply that again by another four vendors that we found that were doing the same thing with just a simple mistake. And now you can see the power and the scalability of using voice the customer data to isolate and eliminate root causes that are causing bad experiences. Oh, and by the way, it also saves you money, because now you're not fielding those phone calls. That's a pretty good deal, isn't it?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e There you go. Now you're speaking the executives\u2019 language. Right?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eExactly. And that's one thing, Dom, that really catches their attention, you know, the same executive on an another root cause from a billing problem, he realized that one particular configuration of the product we were selling was broken. And he had the courage to say stop selling that product, you're damaging the brand. It took about a month, you know, we fixed the root causes underneath that, and then we're able to sell that particular configuration again. But I would submit to you, Dom and Sarah, that thinkers, like that particular executive are rare because it's a courageous thing to say, I'm going to close off a portion of my revenue stream temporarily so that I get it right on behalf of my customers.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRelated Article: \\u003ca rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/customer-experience\/voice-of-the-customer-voc-much-more-than-a-satisfied-customer\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Voice of the Customer (VoC): Much More Than a Satisfied Customer\\\"\\u003eVoice of the Customer (VoC): Much More Than a Satisfied Customer\\u003c\/a\\u003e\\u003c\/strong\\u003e\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eExpand Closed-Loop Feedback to Enhance CX Strategy\\u003c\/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSarah: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah, and also I mean, not to mention the other executive you mentioned too, that was listening to the call center calls that's above and beyond, right for an executive that's like a VP of CX or chief customer officers. Dream boss. no?\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Exactly. And I would tell you, from the lessons that we learned, again, hearing about that GM executive, and seeing the results from my own, one of the things I would recommend to CX practitioners, it's a kind of an uphill battle. But if they could get their executive teams, not just the C-level, folks, but just like you said, VPs, and senior directors, to make it a point doesn't have to actually be listening to phone calls, it can be reading chat transcripts, or reading emails that are coming here in customers pain in their own words, and again, not responding simply to a survey, where they're answering something that we think is important, listen to what these customers are saying in their own words about the pain they're experiencing.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eExactly. So if you could kind of like bring it home, like if we were to encapsulate your experience with CX organizations being the CX leadership role, designing their own strategy, what would be your advice for designing their own strategy when it comes to all this?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eWell, one of the first things I think that makes a customer experience program complete is this notion of closed loop feedback, many of your audience probably is very well familiar with this, and those that are doing it, they're probably very adept at the idea of a customer called in or wrote in with a complaint, we opened a ticket, we found out what caused that problem, we resolved the problem, maybe even did a brief project to find a root cause behind it. And then we close the loop by getting back to the customer expressing, hey, listen, our bad here, we're sorry, that your experience with our product with our service, whatever it might be, we're sorry that that was a bad one, we've resolved the problem, we want to make sure that we close that loop with you.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBrands that are doing closed loop are generally doing that part, some of them better than others. But the one element of closed loop that I find a lot of brands are missing is this whole notion that I just talked through. And that's the how do I take the volumes of complaint data or volumes of questions that come in? They can just be informational questions. And I'm saying Listen, why am I taking such a high volume of them? Maybe I can offer my customers a way to find this information out in an easier way? How do they take these large volumes of data and say, what is the root cause underneath this? How do I find a way maybe to do a project to take that root cause out so that the customers never experienced it in the first place? So I guess, you know, if there was one key attribute that I would take from that notion, not even just for individuals, but for CX teams, is to expand your closed loop feedback processes, to include this element of re-using and re-looking at the larger volume of complaints over time to say, You know what, we've got a pattern here. Let's dig underneath that and find out how we can remove the root cause.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSarah: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eAnd since we're at the end of the discussion, I wanted to ask you if you had any singular takeaway that you'd like to offer for CX leaders that are diving into the voice of the customer, or just anything in the CX space that you want to share with the audience.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eCary, how about the job of Sarah Butkovic on her debut?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eSara is asking the right questions. And she's asking the challenging questions.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eYeah. And she's making calls on like, when the show is going to answer like, All right, we've come to the end of the discussion. We've gotten enough out of this guy, this guy has given us so many good tips. Let's end it while he's hot.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCary:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Exactly. And I think to answer the question for you, Sarah, is this notion of doing in fact, if you look at my LinkedIn profile, you see a lot of folks who are thought leaders, but I actually my profiles is CX doing leader. And that's really what I think I would leave them with Sarah is OK. A lot of folks are collecting voice of the customer data. They're publishing Net Promoter Score for their executives. Oftentimes, they're hoping that NPS changes just because they're measuring it. And to directly answer your question, take that information and do something with it. Use the information that you're collecting the voice of the customer program, as a component of your overall CX program, to say, how do I solve problems, make the root causes go away, so the customer has never experienced them in the first place?\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDom:\\u003c\/strong\\u003e Well said, way to end it, Sarah, thank you.\\u003c\/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSarah: \\u003c\/strong\\u003eThank you.
